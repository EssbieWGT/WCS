The average UberEats or DoorDash tip has since dropped to just 76 cents per delivery.
But for the apps that kept the tipping option before checkout, like Grubhub, workers earn an average tip of $2.17 per order, according to DCWP's analysis.
Council Member Shaun Abreu (D-Manhattan), the tipping law's lead sponsor, blasted the companies' post-checkout tipping practices as harmful to workers.
""When corporations claim that delivery workers are overpaid and app profits are too low, we know they are lying.","Delivery workers have lost as much as $550 million in tips since Uber and DoorDash changed their apps so that the tip option appears only after customers place their orders, the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection charged in a new report.

The findings come as the companies sue the city over a law set to go into effect on Jan. 26 that requires them to offer the option to tip at or before checkout.

New York City's landmark minimum pay law, which guarantees delivery workers $21.44 per hour, went into effect in December 2023. The day the law went into effect, Uber and DoorDash introduced new after-checkout tipping policies in order to hide the higher costs wrought by the new minimum pay standards.

The average tip for a worker making deliveries for UberEats and DoorDash decreased from $3.66 per delivery to 93 cents per delivery in just one week after the companies moved the tipping option, DCWP found. The average UberEats or DoorDash tip has since dropped to just 76 cents per delivery.

But for the apps that kept the tipping option before checkout, like Grubhub, workers earn an average tip of $2.17 per order, according to DCWP's analysis.

“Our report blows the whistle on a massive scheme by Uber and DoorDash to drive down worker pay by more than $550 million. That era has come to an end,” DCWP Commissioner Sam Levine said in a statement. “If these companies do not follow new tipping laws going into effect later this month, they will face significant consequences.”

Uber and DoorDash filed their lawsuit in mid-December, alleging that the new law requiring tipping options before checkout violates their free speech and arguing that it would damage their businesses. The suit cited ""tipping fatigue"" and DoorDash went as far as to accuse the City Council of worsening an ""affordability crisis.""

""In the midst of an affordability crisis, the New York City Council has turned tipping into essentially an added tax by forcing platforms like DoorDash to pressure consumers to tip at checkout,"" DoorDash said at the time.

But both DoorDash and Uber have continued to rake in large profits from food delivery since the minimum pay went into effect, defying their claims to the contrary.

Monthly reports from DoorDash and UberEats show that after the minimum pay law began in Dec. 2023 through June 2025, they earned a combined revenue of $948 million more than what they paid in wages to workers, court filings show.

On Jan. 5, DCWP filed a memorandum in opposition to the app giants' request to stop the law from going into effect as the lawsuit works its way through the courts. Federal Judge George Daniels in the Southern District of New York has yet to rule on the companies' requested injunction; the next hearing is on Jan. 14.

Council Member Shaun Abreu (D-Manhattan), the tipping law's lead sponsor, blasted the companies' post-checkout tipping practices as harmful to workers.

""If someone wants to tip them, they shouldn’t have a hard time doing it. No one is ever forced to tip, and making it more difficult to do so is plain wrong,"" Abreu said in a statement. ""When corporations claim that delivery workers are overpaid and app profits are too low, we know they are lying. True affordability comes from treating consumers and workers fairly, not manipulating how people tip.""

Uber did not respond to requests for comment. DoorDash issued Streetsblog a similar comment as it did last year, changing the opening from ""In the midst of an affordability crisis,"" to “In the midst of an affordability crisis and growing frustration over tipping culture ... the Council plans to force platforms like DoorDash to pressure customers to tip at checkout even though customers can already tip after delivery for a job well done.""

The company claims that its workers are ""averaging closer to $30 an hour before tips,"" though it did not provide evidence. The company claims its lawsuit ""is about fighting rising costs and ensuring delivery remains fast and affordable for all New Yorkers.”",https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/delivery-worker-e-bike-JOCO.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:59:07.450049

Funds back Phase 2, boosting output to 460,000 ounces 3PE+Au

Platreef Phase 1 ramps up after starting production in November 2025

Canadian mining company Ivanhoe Mines announced on Monday that it has signed firm commitments for a $700 million financing package to support production growth at its Platreef polymetallic mine in South Africa. The company stated that the final closing of the transaction is expected within the coming weeks.

Platreef entered production in November 2025 and is currently operating in its first phase of exploitation. This phase is intended to enable annual production of 100,000 ounces of platinum, palladium, rhodium, and gold (3PE+Au). It also includes 2,000 tonnes of nickel and 1,000 tonnes of copper as by-products. Ivanhoe is also preparing a second phase of the project, which is set to benefit from the announced financing.

Ivanhoe specified that this operation is supported by Société Générale, Nedbank Limited, and Absa Bank. It is expected to mobilize approximately $600 million in additional capital. This amount, added to the initial $100 million in financing obtained from the same institutions for Phase 1, constitutes the overall financing package for the project.

This new funding will be used for the expansion of the processing plant. The objective is to increase the production capacity of Platreef to 460,000 ounces of 3PE+Au, in addition to approximately 9,000 tonnes of nickel and 6,000 tonnes of copper. Ivanhoe plans to launch development work once the funds are secured, with a view toward commissioning by 2027.

While awaiting further details on the project, Platreef is simultaneously continuing its Phase 1 ramp-up. Ivanhoe anticipates reaching 80% of the mine’s nominal capacity by mid-2026. The company plans to publish its 2026 production forecasts once the ramp-up of the concentrator is further advanced.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/c2c43e845df6c22668972ec23546b282_S.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:15:37.946655

Generative AI is reshaping early shopping decisions, with 45 per cent of consumers using AI for product research, reviews, and deal-hunting, as per an IBM–NRF study.
Brands must redesign journeys around AI moments, ensure data readiness, and invest in AI skills to stay competitive and build long-term trust.
As Matthieu Houle, CIO at ALDO Group, explained, ""AI is turning shopping into a trusted conversation, much more than a search.
AI is reshaping where, when, and how decisions are made across every industry.","Generative AI is reshaping the first steps of shopping experience before clicking buy, as per a new global study from the Institute for Business Value (IBM), in collaboration with the National Retail Federation (NRF). From hyper-personalised suggestions to curated inspiration, influence now begins long before a store visit or app tap, moving where brands and retailers compete to an entirely new level.

The study found that while nearly three-quarters of surveyed consumers (72 per cent) still shop in stores, almost half (45 per cent) turn to AI for help during their buying journeys. Shoppers still want to see and touch products, but today's savvy consumers increasingly arrive with a sense of what they're looking for and why. They are using AI to research products (41 per cent), interpret reviews (33 per cent), and hunt for deals (31 per cent).

""AI is changing how consumers shop, and every aspect throughout the shopping journey,"" noted Caroline Reppert, senior director, AI and Technology Policy at the National Retail Federation, ""As these technologies increasingly guide consumer discovery, comparison, and choice, retailers that understand and respond to this shift will be best positioned to earn trust, relevance, and long-term customer loyalty.""

Generative AI is reshaping early shopping decisions, with 45 per cent of consumers using AI for product research, reviews, and deal-hunting, as per an IBM–NRF study. While stores remain important, AI-driven discovery now guides choices before purchase. Brands must redesign journeys around AI moments, ensure data readiness, and invest in AI skills to stay competitive and build long-term trust.

For leading brands and retailers, this shift toward AI-shaped discovery is prompting a rethink of how and where they engage consumers. As Matthieu Houle, CIO at ALDO Group, explained, ""AI is turning shopping into a trusted conversation, much more than a search. Consumers now rely on assistants that feel almost human, know their preferences, and offer neutral, best-for-me advice that reshapes how they validate and decide what to buy.""

While 35 per cent of surveyed consumers still desire visually appealing stores with no wait times, AI-powered solutions are nearly as important. In fact, one in three consumers seek super apps that combine commerce with other services, 30 per cent want smart homes with AI personal shoppers and autonomous delivery, and 29 per cent look for effortless purchasing through social platforms.

Consumers are growing increasingly accustomed to AI-powered shopping assistants helping them decide what to buy. That expectation, however, is forming faster than most retail operating models can keep pace, forcing the question: Is data ready to guide and validate what customers ultimately choose?

""AI is not a magic wand,"" emphasised Stanislas Vignon, head of insights (AI and omnichannel) at Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH). ""If you don't have the right data, it doesn't work. And you must test your solution to know whether it works and where it will bring value.""

As AI reshapes consumer decision-making, brands and retailers must redesign shopping journeys around future AI-driven moments, using agents to reduce uncertainty early through research, comparison, and personalised support. Strong data readiness and end-to-end testing are essential to overcome cross-channel challenges. Companies should leverage AI to scale relevance while preserving brand distinctiveness, and invest in AI skills and strategic partnerships to build expertise and deploy AI responsibly.

AI is reshaping where, when, and how decisions are made across every industry. In retail, understanding AI-influenced consumer behaviour will become a defining competitive advantage, separating brands and retailers that shape decisions from those that simply fulfill them.

Orcel sits on the board of the Fondazione Leonardo Del Vecchio charitable foundation and Delfin is a shareholder in UniCredit.
It also owns 17% of MPS, a holding worth 4.6 billion euros, and a 10.5% stake in Generali.","ROME/MILAN, Jan 12 (Reuters) - UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has discussed potentially buying the stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) held by Delfin in contacts with the head of the Italian holding company, three people close to the matter told Reuters.

An investment in MPS could put UniCredit back in play in the consolidation reshaping Italian banking after last year's failed attempt to acquire Banco BPM, another smaller rival.

The sources said UniCredit had also weighed a potential direct investment in Delfin, the holding company of Italy's Del Vecchio family. Delfin declined to comment.

UniCredit is also interested in Delfin's stake in Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, one of the sources added.

UniCredit last year built a holding of nearly 7% in Generali as a financial investment, which it later cut to 2%. Orcel has said UniCredit ""is observing"" developments at Generali.

The outcome of the talks between Orcel and Delfin Chairman Francesco Milleri was not immediately clear.

Delfin belongs in equal parts to the eight heirs of the late billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio.

Orcel and Milleri have frequent contact for several reasons, two other people close to the matter separately said. Orcel sits on the board of the Fondazione Leonardo Del Vecchio charitable foundation and Delfin is a shareholder in UniCredit.

UniCredit still has capital in excess of targeted thresholds, after buying 26% of Germany's Commerzbank and 29.8% of Greece's Alpha Bank.

Orcel's M&A efforts have met resistance from the governments in both Rome and Berlin. UniCredit has blamed Italy for derailing the BPM deal.

Reuters reported in November that Italy's government still aimed to see through a long-held plan to combine MPS with BPM. Italy owns 4.9% of MPS after cutting a 68% stake it had acquired in a 2017 bailout.

Delfin's main asset is a 32% stake in eyewear group EssilorLuxottica. It also owns 17% of MPS, a holding worth 4.6 billion euros, and a 10.5% stake in Generali.

If it were to rise to $7 trillion in 2026, that would require the stock to rise by 56%. Any stock that rises that fast in a year is well worth an investment, and if Nvidia truly has a shot at becoming a $7 trillion company in 2026, it should be at the top of every investor's shopping list.

I think that Nvidia can achieve this lofty goal in 2026, but it will require a few things to happen. If these things transpire, I have no doubt that Nvidia will be a top stock to own for this year.

AI spending isn't slowing down

AI hyperscalers spent a record amount of money constructing data centers in 2025. All of them have informed investors that 2026 will see increased spending as well. That's a big deal for Nvidia, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard computing unit used to train and run artificial intelligence models.

Nvidia's GPUs are the best available, but so are the supporting components, like its controlling software and connecting infrastructure. This makes Nvidia the go-to company to outfit data centers, but there's an issue: Nvidia has sold out all of its cloud GPU capacity. Nvidia must work to increase its capacity to meet this unprecedented demand, and it has already taken several steps to maximize its output.

First, Nvidia plans to significantly reduce its gaming GPU output in 2026. That move will free up chips to be used in the more profitable and in-demand cloud GPUs. Second, Nvidia is pushing its chip supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, to increase its output. That will give Nvidia greater supply and allow it to increase production to meet the massive demand in the market for its chips.

I believe both of these items are achievable for 2026, which will enable Nvidia to maintain its rapid growth rate. For fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027), Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow its revenue by 50%. Analysts have consistently underestimated Nvidia's growth potential, so I wouldn't be surprised if the actual figure exceeds that. Furthermore, there's a somewhat unknown factor that could boost Nvidia's sales even further: China.

Nvidia appears poised to resume shipments of chip sales to China. According to Reuters, there is demand for about 2 million units, while Nvidia has about 700,000 H200 chips on hand. There could be even more demand if these initial shipments go well, and that could also boost Nvidia's growth rate this year.

All of this adds up to a company that could be worth $7 trillion if everything goes as planned for Nvidia.

A $7 trillion market cap won't be easy to achieve

For Nvidia to get to a $7 trillion market cap, we need to make a few assumptions:

Nvidia's profit margins maintain their current level.

Nvidia meets analysts' expectations of 50% growth.

Nvidia's valuation stays at its current level.

AI spending is projected to continue in 2027.

The average Wall Street analyst projects $320 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2027, at Nvidia's current 53% profit margin, which would equate to $170 billion in profits by the end of the fiscal year. Nvidia's current price-to-earnings ratio is 46, which is actually cheaper than it has been over the past few years.

With $320 billion in profits at a P/E ratio of 46, that would value the stock at $7.8 trillion.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850053%2Fperson-throwing-money-in-the-air.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-13 00:59:18.254484

Read more about the IBV study “Retail and Consumer Products in the AI Era”","Retailers operate in an environment where customer expectations rise faster than margins, leaving little room for hesitation regarding transformation. Artificial intelligence has quickly become one of the most powerful forces reshaping how the industry engages shoppers, designs products and runs its operations.

The latest IBM Institute for Business Value study, Retail and Consumer Products in the AI Era, reveals that the next two years will be especially pivotal.

The decisions retail leaders make about AI in 2026 and 2027 will influence not only competitive differentiation. They will also influence how effectively brands keep pace with customers who are integrating AI into their daily lives—using it to inform decisions, navigate choices and shape how and where they shop.

Customer expectations are shifting, and the industry now requires a clear, practical agenda for what comes next. Insights from the study highlight the areas where AI is already creating measurable impact and where retailers should focus their attention to unlock value.

A notable finding from the IBV study is the shift in where AI investment originates. By 2027, 35% of total AI expenses will sit outside the IT budget, up from 28% in 2025. Meanwhile, AI expense within IT budgets is also increasing—from just under 10% of annual IT budgets today to 13% in 2027.

This signals an important industry shift: AI has become a business decision, not just a technology one.

Merchandising teams are increasingly funding AI to enhance product discovery. Marketing teams are deploying AI to personalize content and offers. Supply chain leaders are applying AI to anticipate demand and manage exceptions. When investment flows out of traditional silos, it reflects a broader organizational shift toward operationalizing AI across the enterprise.

The study shows that 80% of retail and consumer products companies now have a long-term innovation strategy for AI. This move underscores that AI is no longer positioned as a side experiment but as a core engine for growth.

Looking toward 2026 and 2027, these investments represent a turning point. AI spending is moving beyond tool experimentation into a phase focused on building the capabilities required to compete in a market shaped by real-time decisions, sophisticated customer expectations and new forms of digital commerce.

Retailers have always relied on data to understand customers, yet much of that data remains underutilized. According to the IBV study, 64% of companies say that their proprietary data is accessible to AI, but only 49% of that data is usable. Moreover, just 26% is being used currently to train AI models.

This gap highlights a significant opportunity. Unlocking proprietary data is one of the most critical components of the 2026–2027 AI agenda because the performance of high‑value AI capabilities—whether in personalization, inventory optimization or forecasting—depends on data quality and accessibility.

Retail has an advantage: the industry has historically collected rich, high‑volume customer and transaction data. As data becomes cleaner, better governed and more connected, the downstream value of AI increases dramatically across experiences and operations.

Customers are already feeling the impact. 58% of executives say that AI improves customer retention and satisfaction, and over the past year, AI has contributed to an average 31% improvement in these areas. For an industry built on loyalty, those gains are significant.

AI’s role in retail is shifting from advisory to action-oriented. The IBV study shows that 84% of executives expect AI to significantly enhance their ability to respond rapidly to market disruptions and evolving customer needs. But the most transformative shift is not speed alone—it’s AI’s ability to take action on complex tasks.

Agentic and autonomous AI systems are already running multi-step workflows: coordinating inventory, personalizing offers and guiding customers through complex purchase decisions. According to the study, 76% of executives are transforming their business models to leverage AI not only for efficiency but also for new revenue streams.

This shift toward action-driven AI is expected to become one of the defining characteristics of retail transformation over the next two years. Organizations that build the foundation for agentic AI in 2026 will be better positioned to elevate experiences and capture new value by 2027.

A compelling example comes from Al Futtaim Group, whose AI-powered Blue app integrates loyalty, payments and shopping into a unified journey. Customers earn and redeem across categories instantly, browse frictionlessly and complete transactions in a single flow—demonstrating the impact of AI-led orchestration paired with human oversight.

The study makes clear that AI augments rather than replaces human roles. AI agents increasingly take on repetitive, multi-step processes across the value chain—linking inventory, payments, logistics and customer data—while employees step in where judgment, empathy and brand trust are essential.

This model frees associates and service teams to focus on higher-value interactions and complex customer needs. Executives report that AI is delivering the most value in marketing, customer service, supply chain operations and digital commerce—areas where operational precision and human connection intersect.

The result is a hybrid operating model where AI manages the complexity, and people amplify what makes retail distinctively human.

The study also highlights the growing importance of ecosystems. AI can have a transformative impact only when tools, partners, platforms and agents work together securely and seamlessly. Autonomous AI cannot reach its potential within fragmented systems.

To prepare for this shift, retailers will need to modernize commerce platforms, redesign processes for non-linear customer journeys and strengthen data governance. When AI systems can understand and act across the full business, retailers can orchestrate experiences holistically rather than in isolated touchpoints.

This is why ecosystem integration sits at the center of the 2026–2027 AI agenda. The future belongs to retailers who can coordinate intelligence across the value chain, not just within individual functions.

Insights from the IBV study point to three areas where retail leaders can focus to accelerate progress:

Use AI to deliver permissioned, hyper-personalized experiences

Tailor journeys through secure customer data, deploy AI in high-impact processes like order-to-cash and supply chain orchestration and ensure that AI tools reflect your brand truth—even when customers interact through external AI assistants.

Enable conversational commerce and automate key tasks with AI

Make your product information discoverable and AI-friendly. Start automating repetitive operational tasks, then expand AI’s role as you establish trust—for both your customers and your teams.

Orchestrate collaboration between AI agents and across ecosystems

Break down silos. Connect business systems. Let AI agents coordinate work across functions. Ensure that AI-driven recommendations and transactions remain secure, accurate and aligned to your brand values.

In retail, every click, cart and conversation carries weight—and AI is amplifying the best of what makes the industry human. Over the next two years, the gap will widen between retailers that use AI to fundamentally rethink how they operate and those retailers that see it as just another layer of technology.

The defining difference will come down to clear decisions about data foundations, operating models and where AI is trusted to act. Strengthening these foundations now will shape the next era of retail performance.

The opportunity ahead is significant—and very real. Retailers who act with intent today will help define what “good” looks like tomorrow. Those retailers who wait might find the pace has already been set for them.

The Turkish denim manufacturer teamed with Karachi, Pakistan-based SM Denim to launch BodyCast, a resin-based finish that’s applied to garments mounted on life-like mannequins. The purpose of this setup is to mirror the human lower body, allowing whiskers, thigh rolls, pocket bite, and honeycombs to form naturally.

The process celebrates how, for more than 150 years, denim has been defined by how it responds to the body—creasing at stress points, fading with friction, and developing character over time, Rimaks stated. Rather than finishing denim on a flat bench and relying on aggressive abrasion or artificial distressing, the process creates three-dimensional wear mapping that feels intuitive, lived-in, and personal to the wearer.

This “new generation” resin is activated under lower temperatures and it does not contain formaldehyte. However, it is not more expensive than the resin treatment. Though it takes longer than the standard resin application, the process can be applied at scale.

“We cast denim on the body,” said Meir Barbut, Board Member at Rimaks. “BodyCast allows us to recreate the way denim truly wears—naturally, honestly, and with depth—while giving brands full control over the final expression.”

The result is a balance of whisker depth, comb intensity and subtle sheen that enhances texture without overpowering the fabric. Finishes can also be adjusted by fit, meaning the process can be applied to the wide variety of jeans in the market like tapered, straight, wide or barrel.

Additionally, Rimaks notes how BodyCast allows garments to “age gracefully.” By eliminating heavy abrasion, jeans are less lightly to breakdown prematurely.

Rimaks aims to take a lead in innovating denim wash and finishing techniques. Last summer, the company partnered with DNM Denim to introduce Nova, a four-step finishing platform that utilizes laser abrasion, ozone-enhanced bleaching, eco-stoning and advanced eco-chemistry.

Fabrics finished with BodyCast will be presented by SM Denim later this month at Denim & Jeans Egypy and Kingpins New York. The fabrics are part of the mill’s Icons collection, which focuses on timeless constructions and indigo shades that tap into the demand for both heritage and modern denim.

“Icons was created as a tribute to denim purists,” adds Junaid Javed, SM Denim executive chairman. “With BodyCast, those fabrics come alive in a way that feels both timeless and relevant.”

Few people lay awake at night fretting about whether there’s enough copper out there, but energy historian Daniel Yergin is warning that a major shortage looms on the horizon and that will lead to steep cost increases and hinder the world from becoming more modern unless it is addressed.

Copper has long been studied by economists as a barometer for what’s happening in the wider economy because of its versatility and ubiquity.

Article content

But Yergin said copper, which is essential for the generation, transmission and use of electricity, is in the midst of a demand explosion. That’s evident in the multibillion-dollar data centres sprouting up to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the fleets of new electric vehicles hitting the roads, which continue to grow rapidly though not as quickly in North America as elsewhere, and the growth of renewable energy installations, among other things.

Article content

Already, copper supplies, about 85 per cent of which come from mines, cannot keep up with the rising demand, he said.

Article content

Fortunately, the current shortage is minimal. Annual demand represents about 28 million tonnes per year, and mine production and recycling produce about 27 million tonnes per year. The difference has been filled in by whatever existing stockpiles are around.

Article content

But that won’t last much longer because copper demand is skyrocketing, Yergin said, something he and a team of commodity analysts, data centre experts, former diplomats and others at research firm S&P Global Inc. laid out in a 110-page report released last week.

It builds on a similar report about copper that Yergin released in mid-2022, but a few months after that report, he said he realized “the world had changed” for copper demand when he arrived at the annual energy conference he founded in Texas and noticed groups of tech executives milling around.

PS Community Hub breaks away from traditional retail apps or loyalty programs by uniting social, commerce, and culture into a single co-creation platform. The hub offers creators tools for content publishing, personal brand building, and monetization through affiliate commissions.

Additionally, it provides a growth path to help creators increase their exposure, unlock new opportunities, and give top users the chance to co-create capsule collections, Pacsun stated.

Through PS Community Hub, the retailer’s goal is to bridge “digital community engagement with real-world product creation” while continuing to drive authentic content that resonates with consumers.

“The creation of PS Community Hub demonstrates Pacsun’s purpose-driven retail strategy, putting creators and our youth community at the heart of our plan to fuel sustainable growth, cultural relevance, and innovation in retail,” said Pacsun CEO Brieane Olson. “Our deep generational listening and Insights from the Pacsun Youth Report have been instrumental in shaping this initiative, ensuring that we address the evolving needs and aspirations of our young consumers and remain at the forefront of technology and social commerce.”

Earnings Watch: JPMorgan and Delta start off the fourth-quarter earnings season amid high expectations, a more expensive market and questions about the Fed's independence

JPMorgan Chase reports quarterly results on Tuesday.

When Delta Air Lines Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. kick off fourth-quarter earnings this week, we'll get the first look at whether corporate America's enthusiasm matches up with that of investors, amid worries about the job market and deeper questions about the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy independently.

For the fourth quarter, at least, Wall Street still expects another round of solid results for the companies in the S&P 500 Index.

In a report on Friday, FactSet forecast earnings-per-share growth of 8.3% for the fourth quarter. That's below the average over the past five years, but it would still mark the 10th quarter of consecutive growth. Profit margins, meanwhile, are expected to stay strong, at 12.8%.

That report said analysts nudged their estimates higher for those results during the quarter - a sign of optimism, and something they don't normally do - even as concerns endured about higher prices, tariffs and the impact of the longest-ever government shutdown. The tech sector helped drive that confidence, despite enduring questions over stratospheric spending on artificial intelligence.

But as expectations stay high, stocks have gotten expensive. The S&P 500, as of last week, had been trading at more than 20 times estimated earnings.

""It'll be very hard to justify stocks and stock-market investors being positive and optimistic if the outlook for the companies is softening or not improving,"" Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks, said in an interview.

Investors rode into 2026 hopeful that a cocktail of lower interest rates, tax breaks, easing inflation and tariff clarity would loosen up consumer spending. But the fourth-quarter results - and the more-important financial forecasts that will accompany them - will follow a December jobs report that showed signs of a still-weak but firming labor market, and a Justice Department criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over whether he lied to Congress about cost overruns for renovations to the central bank's headquarters, which Powell and others have cast as a pretext for an attack on the Fed's independence.

Stocks on Monday appeared unfazed by the investigation, at least for now. But JPMorgan (JPM) and the other banks could field questions about the state of the Fed on calls with reporters and analysts, amid broader pressure by President Donald Trump to get Powell to cut interest rates more aggressively.

""As the long-term outlook goes, the independence of the Fed is extremely relevant, and we have plentiful evidence that monetary policy driven by politics tends to end up with inflationary results,"" Giuseppe Sette, president of the AI-driven analytics firm Reflexivity, said in a email.

""However, the short term might be more resilient,"" he continued. ""We've seen the market effectively shake off Ukraine for a longer while. We've seen it shake off Venezuela. We've seen it shake off Iran and even the Greenland discussions.""

Markets are also still waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on the legality of Trump's emergency-powers tariffs, after justices held off on a ruling on Friday. Nancy Tengler, the chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments, said she'd want to know how the companies reporting in the weeks ahead might rework their production and supply chains if the court ruled against the government.

However, the Trump administration has other ways to place duties on imports. And she said that many companies had already largely rerouted their production and shipping infrastructure, or made other adjustments, to account for the higher import taxes.

""You may see some pops in better-than-expected guidance,"" she said, referring to the financial outlooks companies provide during quarterly earnings. ""But I just don't think it's going to amount to much.""

Heading into the results, some Wall Street analysts were hopeful that Trump's so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" legislation - which cut taxes but also cut or slapped restrictions on some public assistance - might give consumers fatter tax refunds or otherwise jolt spending, helping chains like Walmart Inc. (WMT) and brands like Nike Inc. (NKE).

Lower interest rates and less-aggressive price increases could also help, as companies run out of room to charge more without putting a bigger dent in demand. However, analysts said wealthier consumers would likely benefit more from any policy changes or easing borrowing and living costs.

""The K-shaped economy that everybody keeps talking about is certainly still intact,"" Eric Clark, chief investment officer at Accuvest Global Advisors, said in emailed comments. ""The upper part of the K, the higher income, with real assets and homes, they're doing pretty well, and they're spending really well. The small part, the lower-income cohorts, are struggling, because inflation is still present in a lot of parts of our lives.""

""Retail sales have been strong, but it's not been broad,"" he continued. ""Consumers are being very choiceful. They're asking, 'Is this item an interesting item? If it's discretionary, do I love it?'""

As more companies report, Tengler said she'd also be watching for remarks about spending and hiring plans. Those details would come amid the current inertia of the ""no hire, no fire"" job market, and as analysts watch for the impacts of AI on headcount.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, also said he'd be watching for hiring trends.

""A lot of companies were able to get away with keeping employment high, keeping their payrolls up, because they were able to raise prices and offset some of that increased cost in employment,"" he said.

""I don't think that they're going to have that ability to do that going forward,"" he added later. ""I think inflation has come down quite a bit.""

JPMorgan (JPM) and Delta (DAL) report on Tuesday. Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also report during the week.

Expectations for the banks are higher, as regulators back away from the industry. Analysts were upbeat about dealmaking, investment banking, mergers and acquisitions and IPOs.

However, Mian, at Zacks, said higher interest rates and concerns about the economy had weighed on loan demand. Credit quality could be another focus. But he said concerns about credit quality and delinquencies had leveled off.

Delta, meanwhile, reports in the wake of what Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham called a ""lost year"" for the airlines, punctuated by the government shutdown. But Delta's push toward wealthier fliers has been a plus for the carrier's sales.

""Not all airlines were able to take on a challenging environment and minimize downside to estimates, but Delta and United managed the best, while others struggled,"" Cunningham said in a note last week.

The Big Tech companies that report in the weeks ahead - like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) - will face concerns about financing for the AI infrastructure buildout, which has driven up energy costs, and circular deal-making. But Tengler said that for investors, there are still few places to find growth.

""We keep hearing that the tech trade is dead,"" Tengler said. ""I've been keeping track: We've heard it every summer since 2022, and yet that's where all the growth has come in, not just in the economy and the capex side of things, but in stock-price performance.""

She added: ""We're still seeing a big, huge spread between technology earnings growth and the rest of the market.""

Johnson & Johnson has reached an agreement with the Trump administration tied to its ongoing $55 billion U.S.-based investment plan, reinforcing the company’s commitment to domestic manufacturing, R&D, and job creation. The move reflects broader industry efforts to align capital deployment with evolving federal priorities around supply chain resilience.

At the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, Bristol Myers Squibb outlined how it is positioning the company for the next decade, emphasizing disciplined capital allocation, late-stage pipeline execution, and strategic business development. Leadership highlighted a focus on durable growth drivers across oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease.

Pfizer also used the JPMorgan stage to detail its post-COVID pivot, stressing a sharper emphasis on operational execution and pipeline productivity. The company acknowledged near-term revenue pressure from declining pandemic-related products while reaffirming confidence in its long-term innovation strategy.

Instrument: A means to capture data (i.e., a questionnaire) plus all the information and documentation that supports its use. Generally, that includes clearly defined methods and instructions for administration or responding, a standard format for data collection, and well documented methods for scoring, analysis, and interpretation of results in the target patient population.

*in this article, COA is used synonymously with questionnaire

The licensing and translations process for clinical outcome assessment (COA) measures is notorious for being a major pain point in clinical trial set-up, and is often a significant resource burden, from both a time and cost perspective. But this is not a new concern—as an industry, we have been talking for decades about how much of a source of friction this process can be.

All stakeholders—copyright holders, sponsors, CROs, eCOA providers—should strongly endorse the importance of removing barriers in the drug development process and getting treatments to patients faster. So, why are we still encountering the same issues, and what roadblocks (or incentives) are driving the unacceptable status quo and how can they be solved?

Licensing

The following details common problems encountered during the licensing process that present a risk to study go-live, along with proposed solutions. Furthermore, when—as it so often is—eCOA set-up and implementation is on the critical path to first patient in (FPI) (See Figure 1), these issues can be exacerbated.

Problem: Who is the copyright holder?

Identification of copyright ownership of a COA can sometimes be challenging; research to ascertain this can take time, often requiring contact to be made with several entities, or a trawl through the literature.

Solution: At COA conception (such as during the funding process), developers should ensure a clearly documented path to its use, detailing agreed arrangements for its long-term management—including who will own the copyright, its licensing process, and user support. This is especially pertinent in cases of academically developed measures, where contact information is often only included in a publication, which can become out-of-date if the author has changed institution or retired. Journals that publish findings from COA development should also ensure that clear information on how to obtain permission (if any) for the COA(s) use are available.

Problem: When will the copyright holder respond?

Some copyright holders take weeks to respond to a license request and require much chasing throughout the process.

Solution: Copyright holders should have a duty of care to provide clearly stated response times, ideally along with a clear description of the process required to secure permissions for the COA(s) use (e.g., on their website, or via an automated email response detailing this). When considering the appropriate timeline for response, being cognizant of the fact that COA licensing and eCOA implementation is often on the critical path to FPI, is encouraged. More detailed information would also likely reduce the number of enquires received. If a COA developer does not have the resource or expertise to manage this activity, engaging a COA management organization is recommended.

Problem: What will the license include?

Certain COAs have additional materials that can be licensed (which are not included as standard), and the availability of such materials is not always made clear from the outset. It would be fair to assume that the license would include access to all the available support documentation under the FDAs definition of an instrument1 (Box 1); however, this is not always the case. Furthermore, the cost and timeline implications associated with licensing these elements are not always made clear upfront and can lead to delays and unforeseen (hidden) costs.

Solution: Copyright holders should provide clear information upfront on exactly what a standard license includes and available additions, to enable informed decisions about buying their products. Provision of a minimal package as standard is encouraged, in line with the FDA’s definition of an instrument,1 including:

The Licensed COA

Scoring information, and any associated analytics software

Any administration instructions

Additional elements to facilitate electronic implementation may include:

Direction to adhere to industry best practices for electronic implementation2 or specific copyright holder requirements (especially when they deviate from established best practices)2

Documented process for eCOA reproductions, including any review requirements (e.g., screenshot approval), associated costs, and estimated timelines (e.g., number of rounds of review included and turn-around-times)

Problem: What parameters are required for pricing?

Standardization and consistency in COA pricing models are lacking and can be based on a range of parameters, such as number of sites, participants, administrations, or trial length. As some of these parameters may not be finalized at the point of license initiation (e.g., site selection is ongoing, regulatory bodies may not have approved the protocol), the process can be delayed or will require subsequent license amendments, which is an additional administrative task and potential cost.

Solution: Clear upfront information from copyright holders about pricing parameters for a given COA so licensees can confidently forecast potential licensing costs.

Problem: How long will contract review take?

Licenses of copyright are legally binding contracts that can require review from several different stakeholders (including the CRO, sponsor, eCOA provider, and/or training provider) which can take time. Further, when a study is going to use eCOA, some copyright holders require that this is specified when requesting the license and included in the agreement. When eCOA provider selection is on the critical path to FPI, this can delay licensing initiation and execution.

Solution: In the absence of a standard licensing template used by all copyright holders, at the very least, a commitment to turn around reviews in a specific time is needed.

Problem: When will the COA be provided?

Often, a copy of the COA is not provided until license execution and payment. Not having access to an official copy of the COA prior to this can negatively impact:

Protocol development

Sponsors cannot review and evaluate the appropriateness of individual items and the measure in its entirety, to determine if it is suitable for a given trial application

eCOA technical feasibility assessment:

eCOA providers are unable to ensure their system has the required functionality to build the most optimal electronic version of the COA

eCOA build:

The license has often not been executed and paid for at the time of commencing eCOA build activities—especially where the eCOA provider is contracted for scale management

As contracting and kicking off eCOA services is often on the critical path to FPI, not having access to the COA(s) to create eCOA specifications and the build presents a major risk to study go-live

Invoice terms are usually Net 30 days (and can be greater), and so expediting normal payment terms is required

Ultimately, it runs the risk that some may obtain a copy of the COA from an unreliable (non-official, possibly adulterated) source, to try and assess the suitability of the COA and meet eCOA build timelines.

Solution: Providing an official copy of the COA (including watermarked sample copy or if developed electronically, access to the items) prior to the execution of the license and payment, would significantly benefit the clinical trial set-up process, and reduce the impact of many of the detailed issues. It would be on the strict understanding that it should not be used in a live study until license execution and payment. The license, in this scenario, is for the actual use of the COA (i.e., for completion within a study). With most things in life that we buy, we can review and assess it prior to purchase—whereas what we see for COA licensing is often buying blind.

Alternatively, a limited rights license (that is quick to execute) could be provided to allow for review and/or eCOA build, enabling eCOA providers to reproduce the COA electronically and make reasonable preparations for study use.

Screenshots

Problem: Generating screenshots imminently after eCOA project initiation.

If sponsors request screenshots for ethics committee (EC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) submissions (though they are not necessarily required),3,4 this can create a huge challenge and pressure on eCOA providers to generate these in the time required; especially when the COA is not provided until license execution and payment.

This could become more challenging with the new EU-CTR submissions process requiring a single submission for all EU member states, and the perception that all translated screenshots may be requested by individual health authorities. If copyright holders must approve the screenshots prior to this, further delays can be seen.

Some copyright holders also require live demo review, which can add further time to receiving implementation approval.

Solution: A clear public statement from IRBs/ECs that eCOA screenshots are not required and the paper COA is sufficient.

Translations

Another challenge faced during licensing is the associated translation activities, which present differently dependent on if the required translations already exist or not. For example, it is not always clear what translations are available, the methodology employed (leading to a lack of confidence in faithful translation), and so translations are often repeated, which can lead to variation and confusion.

Copyright holders (or a delegated management organization) should have a duty of care to maintain a published translation database with this information (e.g., on a website)—that is recognized as the only source of official translations—with updates as new ones are added, and on details on access.

If the copyright holder requires approval of eCOA screenshots for every language implemented in a study this takes a significant amount of time, and is a major risk if a sponsor wishes to go live in languages other than a routinely used language (e.g., US English). Copyright holders are encouraged to be mindful of this when requiring approval of all translated eCOA reproductions, or at least sensitive to their impact on timelines when working with stakeholders such as sponsors, eCOA providers and or language service providers.

Are eCOA libraries the answer?

In short, no. At least not based on the current model, and until there is a more cost-effective model for libraries, they are unlikely to have the utility they promise.

Licensing and translations fees are either paid directly, or are passthrough costs, by the sponsor. In the current library model, the eCOA provider must pay the library license fee. For smaller organizations, and especially when projected use can be unclear (i.e., there is no guarantee of recuperation)—it is risky to front-up what can be a substantial amount of money—sometimes in the millions.

Further, sponsors are still required to pay the licensing fee for the actual use of the COA in a study, so the eCOA provider also must develop a costing model that recoups the upfront cost of the library license, which can be especially challenging where sponsors expect cost savings/reductions from using COAs from the eCOA providers library. Sponsors often very reasonably question that if the eCOA is already built, why should they pay the same price for it again. The library model also saves the copyright holder time and resource as they are not repeatedly reviewing screenshots, and yet they are charging extra for a library license, which as mentioned can be substantial.

An alternative model sees approval obtained by the eCOA provider for their build, and then the copyright holder being notified of a new study wanting to use it, so they can confirm it is the approved build. They would still receive the same licensing fees from the sponsor and not have to review implementations repeatedly.

Conclusion

The challenges outlined are well understood, not insurmountable, and entirely solvable. The current approach and relationship between eCOA providers, copyright holders, and sponsors/CROs remains overly transactional, and it is time to move beyond inertia and adopt practical, collective solutions. A committed effort from all stakeholders is required to address the aspects within their control, and the efficiencies to be gained from relatively simple changes to the processes implemented by many copyright holders are not insignificant by any means. Additionally, sponsors engaging copyright holders and eCOA providers earlier (and off the critical path to FPI) would also mitigate some of the challenges described. By doing so, we can move past these recurring problems and focus our energy on more meaningful goals, such as truly optimizing the user experience of digital technologies and speeding up drug development.

Copyright holders who have adopted many of the solutions outlined above, demonstrate a genuine intention and commitment to find ways to remove delays in getting effective treatments to those in need whilst rightly protecting their intellectual property and the integrity of the COA. Mitigating against improper use of COAs that could bring into question the integrity of the specific use of the COA is critical, and the solutions outlined in this article would not bring that into question The payment and contractual requirements would still be adhered to, and the burden felt by sponsors, CROs, and eCOA providers, would be greatly reduced.

Business Insider will keep tracking this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves.","Are AI giants nurturing the web, the most valuable store of human data the world will ever see? Or are they scraping content for free and giving little back? Updated data from Cloudflare sheds new light on this important question.

This is one of the most under-discussed parts of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data.

That's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free.

In the past, tech companies would send users to the original sources of this information. This formed the grand bargain of the web. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques.

In the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Now, AI answer engines and chatbots give users direct answers, making people less likely to visit the websites that created and verified the data in the first place.

Cloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, began tracking this behavior in 2025. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites.

This crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send.

Is this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? I'll leave you to decide. Here's the data for the first week in January.

As you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. According to Cloudflare data, it crawls sites way more than it sends users out to the web. Anthropic actually crawled even more in early January, compared to the first week of September 2025, according to this data.

The same applies to OpenAI; its crawl-to-refer ratio has worsened. Again, this suggests that OpenAI is taking more value from the web and giving less value back.

This aligns with Business Insider reporting from late 2024. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically.

One web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting.

So, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.

Like last quarter, I asked Anthropic why it crawls so much and gives so little back to the web. The startup did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Back in September, Anthropic said it couldn't confirm the crawl-to-refer ratios calculated by Cloudflare and said there may be ""issues"" with the methodology. At that time, Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year. This was generating more referral traffic for websites now, and this is growing quickly, the startup said back then.

OpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment.

A caveat: The numbers that go into the crawl-to-refer ratio focus on the web and exclude native app activity. If app activity were included, the ratios might be lower. However, this methodology applies to all the companies included in this ranking.

Google's relatively low ratio is likely due to its traditional search engine, which still shows clear website links in many results. However, the company is increasingly weaving in AI chatbot-style answers into its search service, via AI Overviews and AI mode.

Google has been saying lately that it still sends traffic to the web, and it cares about the health of this ecosystem.

Walmart is slated to join the Nasdaq 100, an index known for tracking tech stock, on Jan. 20, Nasdaq said.

The planned move comes as Walmart executives have focused on the retailer's e-commerce platform and novel AI tools.

Walmart is getting the recognition it’s been seeking for its e-commerce prowess.

The retail giant will move to the Nasdaq 100—an index tracking the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq —before the market opens on Jan. 20, the exchange operator said Friday. Walmart (WMT) has spent months highlighting its marketplace and delivery services, fueling speculation that it was eyeing the list seen as a tech-sector bellwether.

Walmart will replace pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca (AZN). The move comes about a month after Walmart left the New York Stock Exchange for the Nasdaq, which is home to tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).

Why This News Matters to Investors

Consumer-focused companies from Target to Wingstop have touted their embrace of AI as investors pour money in the technology. Walmart has successfully convinced investors that it's part tech stock, part retailer, and a pending move to the Nasdaq 100 index should bolster that.

The Nasdaq is a better fit for Walmart’s tech-centric approach, company executives have said. The retailer’s business no longer centers around a portfolio of big-box stores, they said, highlighting its booming delivery service, automated fulfillment centers and third-party marketplace.

“The results we're delivering today are powered by our people and by technology,” CEO Douglas McMillon told investors on a November conference call, according to a transcript from AlphaSense. “We continue to get better at putting our data to work, building more capable tech products, and platforms, and by deploying physical automation.”

McMillon highlighted the “digital acumen” of John Furner, head of Walmart U.S., when announcing in November that Furner will succeed him. Furner will lead the company through an “AI-driven transformation,” McMillon said.

Walmart is using AI to interact with consumers in new ways, including pinging customers on WhatsApp to ask if they want to stock up with a basket of frequently-ordered staples. It announced Sunday that it is working with Google to ensure people can easily find and purchase Walmart products when chatting in Gemini, Google’s AI-powered chat service.

In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

But is this enough to raise its disappointing sales performance, especially at a time when the consumer expresses more value-oriented behaviors?

The company’s recent net sales ended 1.5% lower than 2024, a thorn in the side of investors who’ve lamented the retailer’s steady stock decline since its November 2021 peak. Even in the past year, the stock price has fallen by roughly 21.5% as of Jan. 8. Nevertheless, the recent announcement inspired a more local bump, accounting for a 10% spike YTD, indicating support for the retailer’s value play.

On the other hand, competitors Walmart and Amazon continue to capture incremental growth while the chain struggles, despite playing in similar spaces. Walmart also recently debuted a deeper investment in personal healthcare, slashing the price of more than 1,000 wellness items, similar to what Target did in November, albeit more concentrated on the specific assortment.

Target’s latest wellness push is part of a longer-term strategy. Last January, the retail giant expanded its wellness assortment with 2,000 items, with a focus on lower-priced items ($10 or less).

Both expansion announcements emphasize F&B’s stake in the segment, with notable recent additions such as ButcherBox’s retail debut of grass-fed beef; protein snacks and powders from Misfits, David, and Bloom; functional and non-alcoholic beverages from Ryze, Protein Pop, and Naked Life, and gut health support from The Coconut Cult and Seed.

“About 70% of guests are already shopping wellness at Target and right in time for the new year, we’re bringing them even more newness and value,” said Lisa Roath, EVP and chief merchandising officer of food, essentials and beauty at Target, in a statement.

David and Goliath: Taking on Whole Foods (+ Amazon)

The shift towards wellness blurs the lines between hypermarket and natural grocer: Target wants a stellar, premium suite of better-for-you products while still out-pricing the legacy leader, Whole Foods.

This competition is a play for the “better-for-you” shopper, a segment that dominates Amazon brands’ shopper base. To target these consumers, the hypermarket chain is challenging Whole Food’s “aspirational” wellness stigma by positing their healthy assortment as an everyday luxury. The move also carefully navigates the line between Walmart’s hyper-value niche and Amazon’s online, pantry-stocking endeavor.

“Our goal is to make wellness really accessible – fun, easy, affordable and personalized,” Roath said.

In recent months, Whole Foods has worked to separate itself from the premium-priced stigma, which, if successful, would complicate Target’s value proposition. In a conversation at Groceryshop, Whole Foods chief merchandising and marketing officer Sonya Gafsi Oblisk noted that the company is innovating with the value-oriented modern shopper in mind.

“We want our shoppers to walk in and see a sea of yellow,” she said, referring to the sale signs that indicate deep discounts across the grocer’s assortment.

Today’s consumer is focused on shopping deals and reducing food budgets. If Target can capture these shoppers who feel priced out of Whole Food’s premium space, it can secure a path toward growth that can return net sales to the green.

Zooming out, Target’s supply chain operations are aligning with Walmart and Amazon’s model to more adequately compete on online grocery, the most optimistic growth driver with consistent double-digit year-over-year gains.

In December, the chain expanded its next-day delivery capabilities with a “stores-as-hubs” model that allows brick-and-mortar locations to operate as sortation centers. As Target improves service for same-day and next-day delivery, Amazon is pushing the envelope, piloting ultrafast delivery (sub 30 minutes) in Seattle and Philadelphia.

Nick Edser

Shares in banks and credit card firms have fallen after US President Donald Trump called for credit card costs to be capped.

On Friday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that interest rates on cards should be limited to 10% for one year from 20 January.

He did not specify how such a cap might be introduced or whether such a move would be legally enforceable.

Shares in US credit card firms American Express, Visa and Mastercard fell in early trading, while shares in the UK bank Barclays, which has a sizeable US card business, were down 1.9% at close of trading in London.

US banking associations say capping rates will make it harder for people to access credit and be ""devastating"" for millions of families and small businesses.

The average interest rate for credit cards in the US is roughly 20%.

In his statement on social media, Trump called for limiting it to 10%, reviving an idea he had put forward during his 2024 presidential campaign.

""Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,"" he wrote. ""Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.""

On Sunday, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said credit card companies would be ""in violation of the law"" if they did not comply with his demands.

American Express's share price initially fell by 4% while Visa and Mastercard's stock dropped more than 2%. Other US lenders including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America also saw their shares open more than 1% lower.

Forcing companies to lower their lending rates rate would ""upend the basic economics of the industry,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

""Most banks would respond by cutting credit limits, closing riskier accounts, and scaling back rewards programmes, because they simply couldn't cover losses at that price point.""

Nearly half of US households in 2022 carried credit card debt, according to the most recent survey of consumer finances by the Federal Reserve.

It found that those with a balance owed more than $6,000 (£4,454) on average - which, with interest rates around 20%, translated into roughly $100 in monthly charges.

The idea of capping credit card rates has won support from an unlikely coalition of lawmakers, uniting those on the far-left, such as Bernie Sanders, with populists that back Trump's MAGA agenda.

But the path to bringing the proposal into force is unclear.

Similar plans have languished in Congress. The administration has also pushed to reduce the role of agencies that have regulated such issues in the past.

""Begging credit card companies to play nice is a joke,"" Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said on X.

""I said a year ago if Trump was serious I'd work to pass a bill to cap rates. Since then, he's done nothing but try to shut down the CFPB [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]"".

Analysts said executive action by the White House would likely meet with legal challenge from the industry, which has had success in the past fighting regulation in the courts.

A joint statement from five US banking bodies said they shared the president's goal ""of helping Americans access more affordable credit"".

However, they added that the proposed cap would ""reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small businesses who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help"".

""If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.""

Early last year, Sanders and fellow US senator Josh Hawley had introduced bipartisan legislation which aimed to cap interest rates on credit cards at 10% for five years, but it has yet to make it into law.

In April 2025, the Trump administration moved to throw out a regulation capping credit card late fees at $8. The rule had been brought in by President Joe Biden's administration as part of a crackdown on ""junk fees"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5db9/live/491fe3a0-efae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png,N,,2026-01-12 18:02:07.969373

In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.
Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee.
According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.","NEW YORK(AP) — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

BioAge stock jumped more than 14% to 16.01. Shares have climbed nearly 500% from a low point below 3 last seen in April. Today, BioAge shares hold a perfect IBD Digital Relative Strength Rating of 99, reflecting their top-notch 12-month performance.

The company is working on a drug that blocks NLRP3. BioAge tested its drug in patients with obesity and elevated hsCRP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. High levels of hsCRP indicate inflammation in the body, signaling a high risk of metabolic conditions like heart disease, stroke or diabetes.

After two weeks, patients given BioAge's BGE-102 showed an 86% reduction in hsCRP. More than nine in 10 patients, 93%, achieved normal levels of the problematic protein. BGE-102 also reduced IL-6, another protein that can drive inflammation and cardiovascular risk.

BioAge is now planning to start a Phase 2a study in the first half of the year.

Can BioAge Rival Ventyx?

The update puts BioAge Labs in competition with Ventyx, which Lilly is buying for $1.2 billion. Ventyx has a drug that blocks NLRP3 to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Neumora (NMRA) and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) also have NLRP3 blockers in development.

""We are very encouraged by these results, which support the potential for BGE-102 to deliver injectable-like inflammation reduction in an oral therapy designed for primary care, the clinical setting where most cardiovascular risk is managed and where oral medicines are preferred by patients and physicians,"" BioAge Chief Executive Kristen Fortney said in a written statement.

She noted chronic inflammation is now recognized as a major driver of cardiovascular disease. But it's far less treated than high LDL cholesterol, a well-known and treated condition that can raise the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.

Mike Wallace’s Gotham at War offers a guidebook to a half-vanished city, and brings to life the immense human drama that unfolded in New York during the Second World War.

Gotham at War: A History of New York City from 1933 to 1945

by Mike Wallace

Oxford University Press, 2025, 976 pp.

Nearly three decades have passed since the historian Mike Wallace published Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898, cowritten with the late Edwin G. Burrows, to much renown. A second volume, Greater Gotham: A History of New York City from 1898 to 1919 (written by Wallace alone), followed in 2017. With the publication of the third and final installment in this panoramic history, Gotham at War: A History of New York City from 1933 to 1945, it is possible both to view the project as a whole and to look afresh at one of the most transformative eras in the history of New York, the United States, and the world.

There are roughly three faces of New York that run through Gotham at War. The first is the city as a connector—a “critical interlink,” Wallace writes, “between Europe and all of the Americas.” The second is New York as a generator, a source of ideas, forces, people, and products that shaped the country and the world. By playing these roles, New York affected the course of the Second World War; in turn, the war remade New York in ways both obvious and subtle.

A third New York appears early on in the narrative, though it is not until some 400 pages later that one of Gotham at War’s many characters describes it. This man, a young French sociologist recently installed at the New School, spends his days tutoring himself in the ethnology of Latin America at the 42nd Street branch of the New York Public Library. In the afternoons, when he is not writing, he walks the city. “What really amazed [Claude] Lévi-Strauss,” Wallace writes, “was that it seemed all of humanity’s cultures were on display in the astonishingly heterogeneous wartime city.” Lévi-Strauss had worried that industrial society would erase the local particularities of which culture was made. Yet in New York he found not an “ultramodern metropolis” but rather an “aggregation of villages”—a “vast collection,” Wallace writes, “of remnants and survivals from many continents and different eras, a palette of cultural sensibilities, an anthropologist’s dream.”

City as connector, city as generator, city of villages—these are the guises New York assumes not only in Gotham at War, but throughout the thousands of pages of the Gotham series. Inspired by the efflorescence of social history in the 1960s and 1970s, Wallace (with Burrows) originally set out to write a new narrative of all of American history, telling the story from the bottom up, with particular attention to the dynamics of capitalism and empire. Practical considerations eventually interceded, and the authors decided instead to refract their new history of the United States “through the prism of its preeminent city.” Like its pr...",https://dissentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/williams2026fb.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 14:06:53.565605

Burial will follow at Holy Souls Cemetery, Robinson Township.","Walter J. Baker, M.D., of Robinson Township, passed peacefully at home on January 10th, 2026. His caring and steadfast presence touched so many lives in the Pittsburgh community. He was a devoted family man, a proud physician, a devout Catholic, and an outdoor enthusiast.

Walter was born in Crafton, PA to Sylvester and Gertrude Baker on April 1, 1927. He and his six siblings were active at St. Philips Church and in their community, and helped out at the family business, the Seven Baker Brothers Bakery. As a youth, Walt developed a strong work ethic and deep Catholic values, which he continued to practice and model throughout his 98 years of life.

Walter was both a World War II and Korean War veteran, enlisting in the Navy after graduating from Langley High School in 1945, and then serving in the Air Force during the Korean War. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1950, and Walter then completed two different doctorate degrees: in veterinary medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1954, and in medicine from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1965. He fulfilled his medical internship at Mercy Hospital and his Ophthalmology residency at the Eye and Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh, and served as an Associate Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Baker was a beloved mentor to ophthalmology resident physicians at the Veterans Hospital of Oakland, where he tutored surgical cases to budding physicians for 22 years. He practiced ophthalmology at South Hills Eye Associates of Mt Lebanon for over 30 years, during which he held medical staff appointments at Eye and Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh, St. Clair Memorial Hospital, Canonsburg Hospital, and Ohio Valley General Hospital. Walter was known for his caring and compassion for his patients – both animal and human. Patients sometimes remarked “If Dr Baker was good enough to take care of my dog, then he’s the one I want to take care of my eyes!”

Walt married Mary Bernadette Marko on September 5, 1953 at Holy Trinity Church, Robinson Township. His love and devotion to Mary dominated their almost 71 years of marriage. They met at a local soda shop, but soon became inseparable. Together they raised nine children with unwavering commitment to the importance of family in daily life. He would say, “it was hard raising the family, but your mother made it all happen”. Dad had a quick wit, a smile, and kind words throughout his life. He loved history and reading, and was unbelievably knowledgeable, with an answer for any question raised. He was always up for the joke of the day, a raised eyebrow in response to dry humor, and a laugh with the family. His face would light up with a welcoming smile when any of his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nephews or nieces were present, making each feel as if they were the most special. Everyone loved Dad, Granddad, Great-Granddad, and Uncle Walt.

Walter was a devoted Catholic who practiced his faith in every aspect of his life. He had a special devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, praying the Rosary with family members each day. Everyone knew not to call between 9:30pm and 10pm: Mom and Dad were not going to answer during the EWTN rosary. He served as one of the first four Eucharistic Ministers at Holy Trinity Catholic Church and continued this for 44 years, was an instrumental supporter of Holy Trinity Catholic School, participated on multiple committees for school expansion and improvements, and was actively involved in the annual Holy Trinity Festival. He was a leader in community organizations including serving as past-president of Robinson Township Lions Club, member of the American Legion, supporter of the St. Vincent DePaul Society for the Poor, and member of multiple medical organizations.

Walt was an avid gardener—a family of nine children needed lots of vegetables! He loved growing crops alongside family, teaching every step of the way, passing on his knowledge of gardening and grafting fruit trees. The Steelers also held a special place in Dad’s heart. As a season ticket holder since 1969, he regularly attended home games until recently. Dad would not leave until the clock showed triple zeros! He saw Franco’s “Immaculate Reception” and enjoyed traveling to Super Bowl victories. Dad and Mom shared a passion for sports, watching any and all sporting events, side by side. They also loved traveling together, with Florida a favorite destination.

Walter is preceded in death by his beloved wife Mary, his parents Gertrude and Sylvester Baker, his siblings Virginia Smith, Mary Louise Karns, Michael Baker, Sylvia Clark, Sylvester Baker, and Ronald Baker. He is survived by his children Marybeth McCutcheon (Jake), Theressa Strong (Rick), Walter Baker (Michelle), Karen Lauer (Harrison), Susie Shipley (Neal), Lori Roberts (Michael), Elizabeth Moshier (Mike), Brad Baker (Marielle), and Anne Wible (Russ). He is also survived by 31 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.

Family and friends are welcome on Wednesday, January 14, 2026 from 6:00-8:30 PM and Thursday, January 15, 2026 from 2:00- 4:00 PM and 6:00-8:30 PM at Pittsburgh Cremation And Funeral Care, 5405 Steubenville Pike, Robinson Township, PA 15136.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.","NEW YORK — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was ""deeply engaged"" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a ""great choice"" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had ""served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.""

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

What could become of those colorful trading cards that are sitting in an attic? It may have seemed frivolous back then, but today Pokémon cards bring in serious cash.

The dozens of people lined up outside of the Best Buy at Atlantic Terminal Mall weren’t there for a special Black Friday sale on electronics. They queued for a regular release of Pokémon card packs, which they hoped could hold their golden ticket.

Unlike the traditional sports collector cards, Pokémon stand out among the rest in the trading card space because the colorful characters cannot lose favor the way an athlete can. Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Matt Strahm, joked in an interview with YouTube reporter Tyler Boronski.

“Pikachu is not going to tear his ACL…Charizard is not going to get a DUI,” Strahm said.

The Poké-craze might have hit America in the late 1990s, but the money flowing through the franchise over the past few years has completely eclipsed its previous peaks. In 2022, Logan Paul, a famous internet creator, purchased a single Pokémon card for more than $5 million. The Guinness World Record for the most expensive Pokémon card ever sold.

In the first set ever released in the United States, a card pulled from a $4 pack of cards in January of 1999, is now worth thousands of dollars before grading. To grade a card is to preserve the item in a protective sealed plastic slab, which is then ranked on a scale of one to ten to determine the quality of the item. The same card when graded a maximum 10 the value of the card can jump to hundreds of thousands according to pricecharting.com.

This October, the Wall Street Journal identified Pokémon cards as having a higher market return than global titans like Meta Platforms and the S&P 500. The nostalgic trading card game is heading into its 27th year in the United States.These colorful pieces of cardboard aren’t subject to standard financial regulations and pay no dividends. The value of these cards draws buyers to storefronts hours before opening, all for a chance to pull a high-value card from a pack they might not even be able to get.

On Nov. 1, 2025, PokéCourt opened its doors. The first of its kind storefront located in the Meatpacking District of New York City dedicated exclusively to Pokémon. The opening garnered attention from several publications, including Time Out Magazine and Curbed. The store has a floor-to-ceiling stock of rare cards, unique memorabilia, and products up-charged to match their rarity and the deepening pockets of collectors, it’s pure eye candy for anyone involved in the hobby.

Treating rare trading cards as dramatically valued assets isn’t new. The 1952 Mickey Mantle baseball card was bought for over $12 million in 2022. Music superstar Post Malone purchased a trading card from the game “Magic: The Gathering,” for an estimated $2 million.

Brook Trafton, the collector who pulled and sold the card to Malone, said in a TikTok post “…for a guy like me, being able to sell it is life changing.”

This doesn’t mean that the cards don’t fluctuate in value. Not every card released reaches the dramatic heights to catch mainstream attention. During the most recent set release “Phantasmal Flames,” a card of the character Charizard was originally estimated at $1,600 and $4,100 graded. In just two months, it has plummeted to around $600 and $2,200 graded according to COLLECTR, an app that looks similar to many mainstream stock trading apps. COLLECTR allows you to track the value of individual cards aggregated from multiple digital marketplaces such as eBay and TCGPlayer. COLLECTR refers to a collection as a “portfolio,” reinforcing the idea that these are assets to invest in.

For some, the investment is worth waiting outside a Brooklyn Best Buy on a cold Friday morning. Dozens of people spent hours in the cold with hopes of purchasing some cards. Jonathan Harris, 33, said that what brought him to the front of the line was: “the money, the worth of the cards.”

He wasn’t the only person who was in it for the chase of a big hit. Nadia Nizam, 31, said she used to buy and resell clothes and sneakers, but switched to Pokémon cards since they don’t have to worry about “size value,” meaning a size six could be worth more than a size 13.

“Cards are cards, if you have it, you have the money,” Nizam said.

The thrill of the chase has caused a dramatic influx of pressure on storefronts to have large enough stock. The shift is so great, some local hobby shops like Brooklyn Strategist in Carroll Gardens, have hired a “Trading Card Game Coordinator” to manage requests and inventory. Vona Rustay was hand-selected and poached from another hobby shop for her experience. She and the store’s inventory manager have to navigate the delicate balance between fulfilling requests and servicing their community of everyday customers. Rustay said that for their Phantasmal Flames release, almost all of their stock was spoken for before it could even arrive.

“If you told someone they’re selling money at the money store, it’s not unreasonable to believe that the money store would sell out of money pretty quickly, right?” Rustay asked.

It’s not always a winning experience, for some people the chase is tiring. Marcus Joseph, 30, a teacher, was compelled to wait in line early in the morning before going to work, just to engage with their hobby and not pay inflated resale prices, which have created a growing friction between long time players and people coming in only interested in the value of the cards.

“The increase in price is pricing individuals out of their favorite hobby they grew up with as kids or they’re just getting into right now.” Joseph said with an exhale. “And that’s always going to be a negative.”

Brooklyn Strategist implements several stopgap measures to ensure children in their after-school programs and players of the card game can engage with the game meant for them, including a purchase limit of three packs per person per day, and reserving some stock to give away as prizes to those playing the game at their events. Rustay said that it’s an effective way to maintain and continue to strengthen their community.

Across North America, people are even breaking out into fights in an effort to purchase

cards from the Phantasmal Flames set. The demand is so high, two men were charged with assault after an incident in Ottawa, Canada when they got into a fist fight over trying to purchase the product. With popularity and access ebbing and flowing, it’s unclear whether Pokémon cards will still be worth fighting over in the next year or not.

For now, the shiny pieces of cardboard are lotto tickets, each a number waiting to be pulled to hit big. But the odds might not be any different than buying a Powerball ticket.",https://cdn.nycitynewsservice.com/blogs.dir/9/files/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.50.17-PM-1152x759.png,N,,2026-01-12 13:18:08.047509

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms.
In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.
Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee.
According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.","New York — Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.

Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors — where, the company notes, she was “deeply engaged” in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.

The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of U.S. President Donald Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a “great choice” by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and noted that Powell McCormick had “served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick’s experience in global finance, “combined with her deep relationships around the world,” made her “uniquely suited to help Meta” in its future growth.

Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush. She is married to U.S. Sen. David McCormick, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush — before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.

And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions — including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.

According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.

The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Trump's orbit.

Dive Brief:

USA Truck CEO George Henry, former CEO James Reed and former CFO Zachary King have finalized a deal to buy the carrier from DSV. The transaction closed Friday

The publicly traded company, headquartered in Hedehusene, Denmark, acquired USA Truck in April 2025 by buying parent company DB Schenker. Potential divestment and a strategic review took up much of the year.

“The extensive knowledge and global supply chain insights gained under two of the world's leading freight forwarders are now a permanent part of our operational DNA,” Henry said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

An Arkansas-based entity called UTAC is buying USA Truck and its subsidies, returning ownership to where the company’s legacy began according to a news release.

The switch “allows USA Truck to operate with greater speed, flexibility, and focus, prioritizing customer relationships, service reliability, and disciplined growth,” the release said.

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, and DSV didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment.

USA Truck began in 1983 when Bob Powell and others bought Crawford Produce. An initial public offering took place in 1992. In 2022, shareholders of the privately owned DB Schenker approved an acquisition deal.

USA Truck currently has 1,800 trucks and 6,000 trailers and provides dedicated, intermodal, logistics and other transportation services.

Other M&A is also kicking off the new year. The Oren family, which has controlled the Dart transportation business for over 90 years, sold to a private investment firm in a deal effective Jan. 1.

Such deals could accelerate given broader economic changes, according to PwC. “Easing interest rates and a modest rebound in freight volumes are enabling buyers to revisit deals that were paused earlier in the cycle,” a report last month said.

For investors, the takeaway is clear: the valuation of pharmaceutical companies will increasingly depend on their ""compute-to-chemistry"" ratio.","In a move that signals the definitive arrival of the ""AI-first"" era for the pharmaceutical industry, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a massive expansion of their strategic partnership today at the 44th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference (JPM26). The centerpiece of the announcement is a first-of-its-kind ""AI Co-Innovation Lab,"" a $1 billion joint venture designed to fundamentally re-engineer the drug discovery process through ""lab-in-the-loop"" automation and physical AI.

The partnership marks a transition from using artificial intelligence as a simple data-processing tool to integrating it as a core scientific collaborator. By combining Lilly’s deep biological expertise with Nvidia’s cutting-edge Vera Rubin computing architecture, the two giants aim to slash drug development timelines from a decade to as little as three years. This alliance is not just a technological upgrade; it is a structural shift in how the world’s most valuable pharmaceutical company intends to maintain its lead in the hyper-competitive cardiometabolic and oncology markets.

A New Blueprint for Biological Discovery

The AI Co-Innovation Lab, scheduled to open in South San Francisco by late March 2026, represents a $1 billion commitment over the next five years. The facility will be staffed by a hybrid team of Lilly research scientists and Nvidia AI engineers working side-by-side. The primary objective is to perfect ""closed-loop"" discovery: a system where AI agents autonomously design new molecular structures, trigger robotic ""wet labs"" to synthesize and test them, and then instantly ingest the experimental data to refine the next round of designs. This ""lab-in-the-loop"" workflow is expected to operate 24/7, effectively removing the human bottleneck from early-stage candidate selection.

The technological backbone of this initiative is Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin architecture and an expanded version of the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform. This follows an earlier collaboration in late 2025 where the companies built a massive ""AI factory"" supercomputer utilizing over 1,000 Blackwell GPUs. Beyond discovery, the new lab will focus on ""digital twins"" for advanced manufacturing. By simulating production lines in a virtual environment, Lilly aims to optimize the complex manufacturing processes required for its high-demand GLP-1 medications, potentially solving the supply constraints that have dogged the industry for years.

Winners, Losers, and the Tech-Pharma Arms Race

The immediate winners of this announcement are undoubtedly Eli Lilly and Nvidia. For Lilly, the partnership solidifies its reputation as the most technologically advanced ""Big Pharma"" player, moving beyond the ""hype cycle"" of AI into tangible, operational scale. For Nvidia, the deal provides a massive real-world proving ground for its healthcare-specific hardware and software, cementing its position as the ""arms dealer"" for the future of medicine.

However, the news puts immense pressure on rivals. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), Lilly’s primary competitor in the obesity market, has its own partnerships with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia, but analysts at JPM26 noted that Lilly’s move toward a co-located, dedicated lab gives it a superior ""operational edge."" Meanwhile, legacy biotech firms that have been slower to adopt ""agentic AI"" may find themselves falling behind in discovery speed. In the tech sector, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) remains a formidable challenger through its Isomorphic Labs, which recently launched the TxGemma models. While Google’s AI prowess is undisputed, Nvidia’s focus on the ""physicality"" of AI—robotics and manufacturing—gives it a distinct advantage in the eyes of pharmaceutical executives who need to produce physical pills and injections.

Navigating the Regulatory Frontier and Industry Trends

This partnership arrives at a critical regulatory juncture. In early January 2026, the FDA released its first formal draft guidance on the use of AI in drug development. The new framework emphasizes ""methodological transparency"" and requires companies to prove that their AI models do not suffer from ""drift"" or bias over time. The Lilly-Nvidia lab is specifically designed to meet these high bars by creating a ""traceable"" AI path, where every decision made by an algorithm is backed by physical data from the robotic wet labs.

The broader industry trend is a shift away from ""narrow AI""—which solves specific, small problems—toward ""General Purpose Biological AI."" We are moving past the era of simply predicting how a protein folds (a milestone achieved years ago by DeepMind) to predicting how a drug will interact with an entire human organ system. This ""digital twin"" approach is the new gold standard, and the LLY-NVDA alliance is the first to attempt it at a multi-billion-dollar scale.

The Road Ahead: From Silicon to Clinical Trials

In the short term, the market will be watching for the official opening of the South San Francisco lab in March 2026 and the first batch of ""AI-native"" drug candidates to enter Phase 1 trials. The long-term challenge will be the ""black box"" problem: can Lilly convince regulators that a drug designed by an AI agent is as safe as one designed by a human chemist? Strategic pivots may be required if the FDA demands higher levels of human oversight than the ""closed-loop"" system currently envisions.

Furthermore, the partnership will likely trigger a wave of M&A activity. Smaller biotech companies with unique datasets will become prime targets for ""Big Tech"" and ""Big Pharma"" alliances looking to feed their hungry AI models. Companies like Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN), which recently acquired Dark Blue Therapeutics to bolster its own AI oncology pipeline, are already signaling that they will not let Lilly and Nvidia run away with the market without a fight.

A Final Assessment of the JPM26 Milestone

The Eli Lilly and Nvidia partnership expansion is more than just a corporate deal; it is the blueprint for the pharmaceutical company of the future. By merging the world’s most advanced computing with the world’s most successful drug development pipeline, the two companies are attempting to solve the ""Eroom’s Law"" problem—the observation that drug development becomes slower and more expensive over time.

For investors, the takeaway is clear: the valuation of pharmaceutical companies will increasingly depend on their ""compute-to-chemistry"" ratio. As the JPM26 conference concludes, the market will be looking for signs of ""model reliability"" and the first signs of shortened clinical timelines. The intersection of Big Tech and Big Pharma has officially moved from the laboratory to the factory floor, and the impact on global healthcare could be profound.

""We intend to launch in many, many countries around the world, as quickly as possible,"" Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific and product officer, told Reuters at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, which kicked off on Monday in San Francisco.

He said the $150-a-month cash pay price will put the drug in reach of consumers who have been priced out of getting the new obesity treatments until recently.

""It's hard to find a cup of coffee for $149 a month, that's $5 a day. We've spent billions of dollars in science here, and tens of billions of dollars to build factories to make this. Then we're offering it at Starbucks pricing,"" Skovronsky said.

CONVENIENCE VERSUS NOVO'S PILL

Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO), opens new tab launched its once-daily weight-loss pill in the U.S. earlier this month, and Lilly expects to counter the first-to-market advantage by emphasizing the convenience of orforglipron.

While Novo's oral semaglutide needs to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before eating, drinking or using any other oral medication, Lilly's pill does not have those restrictions.

""Ours is a small molecule. It's just like any other pill. It's not affected by food or water, what time of day you take it, or whether you fast. So I think that's an advantage for patients who want that kind of convenience,"" Skovronsky said.

Skovronsky also said he believes there will be a market for the pill as a maintenance dose for people who want to stop using injectable weight-loss medications - particularly patients on Novo Nordisk's drug.

Many patients who have already lost weight are looking to switch to a less strong drug to maintain their weight, he said.

""People coming off of the monotherapy GLP-1 - coming off of semaglutide injection - can switch to the pill without regaining any substantial weight,"" Skovronsky said.

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER STRATEGY

Skovronsky also touted the reach of Lilly's direct-to-consumer sales program, Lilly Direct, through which patients can buy its Zepbound weight-loss injection without insurance.

He said more than one million people have been treated with its GLP-1s through Lilly Direct.

Skovronsky likened Zepbound to Lilly's own version of what the tech industry calls a ""killer app"" that can familiarize consumers with Lilly Direct.

He said the company hope to extend sales through the program to other treatments like its Alzheimer's drug and an experimental medicine in development to lower lipoprotein (a), a type of cholesterol that like LDL increases heart risk.

Nvidia's engineers will work alongside Lilly's experts in biology, science, and medicine to generate large-scale data and build AI models to advance medicine development. The lab's work will begin early this year, the companies said.

The investment builds on Nvidia and Lilly's existing partnership. Lilly in October said it was building an AI factory with Nvidia's AI systems to speed up drug discovery timelines.

Lilly shares rose fractionally Monday and are up nearly 34% over the past year, surpassing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 19% gain. The company became the first healthcare name to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization in November.

Nvidia, meanwhile, is the most valuable company in the world, becoming the first to cross $5 trillion in 2025. The AI chipmaker's project with Lilly is the latest in a string of investments and deals spanning the AI ecosystem — some of which have raised eyebrows on Wall Street and spurred fears of an AI bubble.

In the healthcare space, Nvidia has also invested in biotech firm Recursion and has inked partnerships with other industry leaders, including Lilly rival Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Mayo Clinic, Illumina, and IQVIA, to use AI in medical research and development.

“AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement Monday.

Ajay Agrawal, Sirion founder and CEO, added: “Contracts sit at the heart of every major enterprise transaction… and they increasingly define how value flows through an organisation.”

AI referrals consist of online-shopper traffic generated by clicking on a link in an answer generated by an AI chatbot or automated system.
Adobe Analytics tracked more than 1 trillion visits to retail e-commerce sites in the United States, 100 million stock-keeping units, and 18 product categories.
“This is where things get especially interesting for retailers,” Vivek Pandya, director of digital insights at Adobe Analytics, says in a blog post.","Artificial intelligence is playing a significantly bigger role in online shopping, according to Adobe Analytics. During the 2025 holiday shopping season, AI referrals generated a nearly seven-fold increase in online retail shopping traffic, compared to a year earlier, Adobe says.

At the same time, conversion rates from AI referrals were 31% higher than from other online sources—nearly double that seen in the same period a year ago—during the 2025 holiday shopping period, which ran Nov. 1 through Dec. 31. Shopping-driven events, such as Black Friday, also saw significantly higher year-over-year increases. AI-driven conversions on Thanksgiving Day were 54% higher than those not AI-driven, and 38% higher on Black Friday, Adobe says.

AI referrals consist of online-shopper traffic generated by clicking on a link in an answer generated by an AI chatbot or automated system.

The increase in AI-generated referrals and conversions helped boost AI-driven revenue per visit more than two-fold during the holiday shopping season.

Adobe Analytics tracked more than 1 trillion visits to retail e-commerce sites in the United States, 100 million stock-keeping units, and 18 product categories.

In addition to tracking AI referrals and conversions, Adobe tracked what happens after shoppers click through a link from a generative AI-powered chat service or browser.

“This is where things get especially interesting for retailers,” Vivek Pandya, director of digital insights at Adobe Analytics, says in a blog post.

Shoppers who arrive at retail sites from generative-AI assistants were 33% less likely to leave immediately, a 14% improvement since the beginning of 2025, Adobe says.

“In practical terms, this means shoppers arriving from AI assistants aren’t just landing and leaving,” Pandya says. “They’re spending 45% more time on-site and viewing 13% more pages per visit, signaling higher intent and stronger alignment with what they’re looking for.” Some 81% of online shoppers using AI assistants reported a better shopping experience.

One reason consumers are actively embracing AI referrals is trust in the technology, according to the research. Some 47% of consumers reported trust in AI, while 64% of shoppers using AI report being satisfied with the links they receive, and more than 55% say they actively click on those links, according to the Adobe Analytics Holiday 2025 Consumer Survey. In addition, 65% of online shoppers using AI are more confident in their purchase after the help of AI, and 68% say they are less likely to return the product after using AI for the purchase.

“As trust grows, purchase confidence is also rising,” Pandya says. “As more consumers turn to large language models to research products, compare options, and make decisions, one thing is becoming clear: generative AI is no longer a side channel for commerce discovery.”",https://v6r2p5t5.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AI-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:02:47.426022

Under the pilot, announced on Friday, BNY has enabled an on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its Digital Assets platform. The tokenized deposits operate as digital book entries that reflect participating clients’ existing demand deposit claims against the bank. While balances are mirrored on-chain, they continue to be recorded on BNY’s traditional systems for regulatory, accounting, and reporting purposes.

The capability runs on BNY’s private, permissioned blockchain. The bank said the launch is designed to support programmable, near-real-time cash movement, as is increasingly demanded by financial market participants.

“As global financial markets shift towards an always-on operating model, institutions are seeking faster and more efficient ways to move assets — with greater settlement certainty, transparency, lower friction and capability to unlock liquidity,” said BNY chief product and innovation officer Carolyn Wei.

BNY, the world’s largest custodial bank with nearly $58 trillion in assets under custody, has been exploring tokenized deposits for some time. Banking Exchange first reported in late 2025 that the bank was testing the capability, which has now progressed into a live pilot for institutional clients.

Early participants in the initiative include Baillie Gifford, Circle, Citadel Securities, Galaxy, Ripple Prime, Invesco, and WisdomTree.

Less covered, but certainly related and also followed by investors and analysts, was the concurrent rise of copper (+36%). However, another industrial metal commodity advanced by an even larger amount under the radar of many investors focused on precious metals: Aluminum. From April 25 to the time of this writing, aluminum prices have gained over +842 points, or roughly +38%, to a near all time high of $3,090 per ton.

There are a myriad of reasons for aluminum’s price surge, but lower supply and higher demand, combined with geopolitical policy domino effects, are the primary causes. Nevertheless, the price trajectory, like that of gold and silver, shows little signs of abating. Therefore, stocks that will be able to capitalize on this continued price elevation may be of interest to investors. Some major companies’ stocks to keep an eye on are:

Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CCK)

Constellium SE (NYSE: CSTM)

Kaiser Aluminum (NASDAQ: KALU)

Reliance, Inc. (NYSE: RS)

When Tariffs Move Markets

Like pretty much all market prices, Aluminum fell precipitously shortly following President Trump’s reciprocal tariff announcement at the end of March. Since China, the EU, and the US are the three largest global aluminum market consumers, the US deployment of tariffs on aluminum imports triggered a price hike that has continued to the present. The US market was impacted in a number of ways that contributed to the global price elevation:

Since the goal of the tariffs was to support domestic production, imports, with some aluminum items taxed as much as 50%, were subsequently priced too expensively to make it worthwhile for export nations to ship to the US.

With imports curtailed and domestic production having no lead time to gear up for production, US inventory supplies dwindled, causing accelerated price demand.

Ironically, the BBB tax cuts have boosted US manufacturing in automobiles, aircraft, consumer and industrial container packaging, construction, and other domestic production industries, along with the new huge demand from AI data centers. These industries are all dependent upon aluminum, and the low inventory levels contributed to the price squeeze.

Geological difficulties in locating new sources of bauxite to produce aluminum have also caused international commodity market prices of aluminum to elevate over future shortage concerns.

Crown Holdings, Inc.

Headquartered in Philadelphia, PA with a history dating back to the end of the 19th century (1892), Crown Holdings is one of the premier global manufacturers of aluminum cans, packaging, and specialty containers. The company has operations in the Americas, Western Europe (out of Switzerland distributing also to Africa and the Middle East), and Asia (via Singapore). A short list of their global customer list includes such multinational brands as:

Anheuser-Busch

Conagra Brands

Abbot Labs

Clorox

Coca-Cola

Campbell’s

Diageo

Federal Express

Dupont

General Mills

Kraft-Heinz

Pitney Bowes

Pepsico…. And the list goes on.

With a $261 million stake, Impactive Capital is CCK’s largest shareholder. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded their rating on CCK to “overweight”, citing increases in energy drinks, hard teas, and other new beverages. Additionally, CCK’s stranglehold on supplying aluminum containers for so many global brands over so many years gives it a commanding supply chain control over its customers, who would likely find switching to another supplier too costly.

Constellium SE

A joint American-Swiss and French amalgam as result of M&A deals combining Alcan, Alusuisse, and Pechiney, Constellium is a global producer of rolled and extruded aluminum and various alloys, as well as of custom parts. Its customers include:

Airbus

BMW

Mercedes-Benz

Boeing

Ford

Audi

Headquartered in Paris, France, Constellum also has offices in Zurich, Switzerland, and Baltimore, MD. Constellum’s large aluminum use clientele has certainly driven its stock price in sympathy with the aluminum market price: since April 2025, its stock has zoomed from $7.56 to $21.00. Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and UBS all rate CTSM a “buy”.

Kaiser Aluminum

Formed in 1946 right after WW II, Kaiser has had a history of acquisitions, divestments, military and government projects, unionwide labor disputes and even a 4-year long bankruptcy period. However, the Franklin, TN company has bounced back each time to pick up the pieces and get back into the ring. Kaiser’s primary products are rolled aluminum, plate, sheet, can sheet, and extruded bar, tube, and wire products. Its unique, special niche is its specialty fabricated ALH26 products for the aerospace and automotive industries. Among Kaiser’s 750 regular corporate customers are:

Boeing

General Electric

Avid Technology

Weyerhauser

Whirlpool

Stanley, Black & Decker

Stellantis

Northrop Grumman

Lockheed Martin

Similar to Constellium, Kaiser’s stock has also made triple digit gains since April, going from $48 to $123. From a fundamental analysis perspective, KALU has an attractive 2.50% yield and 2025 revenue is expected to report 10.64% growth with 12.95% in 2026, and estimated earnings to report +135.53% for 2025 with an extra +22.45% in 2026.

Reliance, Inc.

When it comes to US metals processing services, Reliance is the #1 largest metal solutions provider, distributing and processing over 100,000 metal products through a vast network of service centers. In addition to aluminum, Reliance also processes carbon steel, stainless steel, brass, titanium, and a range of alloys. Reliance also handles cutting, inventory, and specialty fabrication. Its 320 locations handle 15% of cumulative US metals processing.

The collaboration centers on integrating EndoQuest’s visualization system, robotic control and secure cloud services with NVIDIA’s Physical AI software stack to deliver real-time image processing, robotic control and cloud-enabled intelligence within a unified architecture. The company said the approach is intended to support real-time, image-based solutions for intraoperative tissue differentiation, perfusion visualization and select autonomous surgical tasks.

The next-generation platform is also expected to incorporate capabilities for remote robotic operation, teleproctoring for surgical guidance and collaborative surgical workflows, orchestrated to achieve the lowest possible latency using NVIDIA Holoscan software development tools.

“AI and robotics will redefine the operating room by enhancing surgical vision and precision beyond human limits,” said Todd Wilson, chief medical officer and chairman of the International Advisory Board of EndoQuest Robotics. “This shift will enable earlier diagnosis and highly targeted therapies that minimize patient impact while maximizing the potential for cure.”

Eduardo Fonseca, chief executive officer of EndoQuest Robotics, said the company is focused on simplifying and strengthening its technology foundation. “By powering our visualization, control, and secure cloud services with NVIDIA AI infrastructure, we aim to streamline our system architecture for performance, reliability and clinical scalability,” Fonseca said. “This unified architecture is critical to advancing our technology for endoluminal robotic surgery and supporting future capabilities in imaging intelligence, robotic performance, and connected surgical workflows.”

As part of the initiative, EndoQuest will use NVIDIA AI infrastructure to support low-latency sensor processing and 3D visualization, precise and time-synchronized motion control, and secure cloud connectivity. The company said these capabilities will enable fleet management, data services, teleproctoring and future artificial intelligence deployment, with insights informing product development and commercialization plans.

The announcement coincides with EndoQuest’s PARADIGM Trial, a pivotal multicenter study evaluating the company’s endoluminal surgical system for lower gastrointestinal procedures performed by colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists.

Advances in endoluminal robotic surgery

Endoluminal robotic surgery is emerging as a significant area of innovation within minimally invasive care, driven by advances in imaging, computing power and artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional laparoscopic or open approaches, endoluminal systems are designed to operate through natural orifices, allowing physicians to reach lesions deep within the gastrointestinal tract while minimizing external incisions and trauma.

Recent progress has focused heavily on improving visualization. High-definition, 3D imaging combined with real-time image processing is enabling surgeons to better distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue during procedures. Emerging techniques such as enhanced perfusion imaging and tissue characterization are helping clinicians assess blood flow and tissue viability intraoperatively, potentially improving decision-making and outcomes.

Robotic control systems have also become more sophisticated, with improved dexterity, stability and precision in confined anatomical spaces. Advances in motion scaling, tremor reduction and time-synchronized control are allowing more precise manipulation of instruments, which is particularly important in delicate GI procedures where millimeters matter.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly being layered into these platforms, supporting functions such as image recognition, workflow assistance and early steps toward task automation. While fully autonomous surgery remains a long-term goal, current systems are exploring semi-autonomous features that can assist with repetitive or highly standardized tasks under physician supervision.

Connectivity is another key trend shaping the sector. Secure cloud integration is enabling remote system monitoring, data aggregation and analytics, as well as teleproctoring, where experienced clinicians can guide procedures from afar. This has implications not only for training and consistency of care, but also for expanding access to advanced procedures in settings that may lack on-site expertise.

Together, these advances point toward operating rooms that are increasingly data-driven, connected and precise, with endoluminal robotic technologies playing a growing role in less invasive diagnosis and treatment of complex gastrointestinal conditions.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/medec/a33cf50ebdcf5494f27cac1af639b8dd67227891-5501x3667.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:03:29.291420

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.5%.","Uber Technologies (UBER) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this ride-hailing company have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Uber belongs, has gained 3.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Uber is expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -74.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.5%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.61 indicates a change of -32.7% from what Uber is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Uber.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/zacks.com/432476d296d64c50172213c0415587c9,N,,2026-01-12 11:14:47.953747

The companies announced plans to bring drone delivery to 150 additional stores across the country, creating the largest commercial drone network in U.S. history.

This expansion will establish over 270 drone delivery locations by 2027, serving roughly 40 million people and making aerial deliveries as common as ordering pizza. The rollout kicks off with Houston launching Jan. 15, followed by major metros including Los Angeles, Miami, St. Louis, and Cincinnati throughout 2026 and 2027.

An American retail tale

The numbers tell a decent story. Wing’s most active customers are ordering three times per week, while total deliveries have tripled in just the past six months. That’s more frequent than most people order takeout. People aren’t just trying drone delivery once—they’re making it part of their daily routine for essentials like eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, and even Takis snacks.

Customers have already completed hundreds of thousands of deliveries since the partnership launched over two years ago in August 2023. The expansion builds on operations in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, where people have turned 30-minute aerial grocery runs into normal behavior.

Say hi to the sky

Here’s why customers are ditching traditional delivery methods for robots in the sky. Wing’s aircraft can carry up to 2.5 pounds (1.13 kg) normally, but newer models handle five-pound payloads while cruising at 65 mph (ca. 105 km/h)—fast enough to beat most car trips across town of up to 12 miles (ca. 19 km) round trip.

The drones operate beyond visual line of sight up to six miles (ca. 10 km) from stores, using tethers and hooks to pick up packages from designated parking lot sites before dropping them on customers’ front lawns.

Since launching in 2012, Wing has completed over 750,000 deliveries globally. The company isn’t just focused on retail either—they’re also partnering with DoorDash for restaurant deliveries in Dallas and Charlotte, creating an aerial delivery ecosystem that’s reshaping last-mile logistics.

Rise of the robots

This massive scale-up signals that drone delivery has moved far beyond experimental phase into mainstream utility. Walmart becomes the first retailer operating drone delivery across five states—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas—with over 150,000 deliveries completed over the past five years since launching the program in 2021.

Within the next decade, McKinsey projects 1.5 million commercial drone deliveries by 2035, and Wing and Walmart are positioning themselves at the forefront of what could become the dominant delivery method for small, urgent purchases across America.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2026/01/Wing-Drones.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:04:14.114986

BioNeMo includes several open models, which come with open datasets.","Eli Lilly and Nvidia, two primary drivers of the recent stock market rally, are deepening their alliance to connect silicon with biology through artificial-intelligence-powered drug development.

The two companies will establish a new AI co-innovation lab with a commitment to invest more than $1 billion over five years, Nvidia announced at the 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.

“This co-innovation lab is dedicated to achieving accelerated, closed-loop discovery and the creation of AI models to improve clinical development,” Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at Nvidia, said in a press briefing.

Scientists from the two firms will come together at a new site in the Bay Area that the pair expects to open by the end of March, Powell said.

Both sides are allocating dedicated, incremental resources to the partnership. Lilly will contribute its drug R&D expertise and laboratory infrastructure, while Nvidia will provide AI capabilities including open biology models, multimodal foundation models, agentic and physical AI, and DGX Cloud capacity, according to Powell.

“We see this as a catalyst for the capabilities that will define the next era of drug discovery,” Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Lilly, said in a Jan. 12 statement. “By working with NVIDIA, we’re uniting massive compute, specialized talent and the ability to shape data at immense scale. We’re moving toward a future where discovery is driven by rapid experimentation and increasingly customized models—an approach that reflects our commitment to leading applied AI in drug discovery and investing deeply in new forms of data generation and model development.”

The latest collaboration between Lilly and Nvidia builds on the companies’ “AI factory” project, under which Nvidia is helping Lilly build what could become the pharmaceutical industry’s largest supercomputer designed to accelerate drug discovery and shorten development timelines.

For the new joint lab, a major focus will be on producing real-world lab data to train and validate AI models.

“We’re going to continue to create ground truth data in the lab so that we can train these biology foundation models with multimodal data, taking advantage of all of the advancements that we’ve seen in [large language model] in biology,” Powell said.

With the help of AI, the team will work to shorten the process between hypotheses and discovery in the hopes of establishing a new scientific paradigm, Powell added.

In addition to R&D, the two firms will have the opportunity to apply AI across Lilly’s businesses, including manufacturing and commercial operations. Powell highlighted Nvidia’s three physical AI and robotics platforms—Omniverse, Isaac and Jetson—which she said can fit into Lilly’s manufacturing facilities.

Lilly and Nvidia are broadening their collaboration as both invest heavily in each other’s territories.

“Lilly is shifting from using AI as a tool to embracing it as a scientific collaborator,” Lilly’s chief AI officer, Thomas Fuchs, said in an October release about the new “AI factory.”

To extend the reach of its AI capabilities, Lilly last year launched Lilly TuneLab, an open innovation platform that gives biotech companies access to its AI drug discovery models. In return, the ecosystem creates a two-way flow of information that provides Lilly with new data to refine those models.

Friday, Schrödinger announced it’s integrating Lilly’s Tunelab into its drug design software, LiveDesign.

For its part, Nvidia will announce at JPM an expansion of its BioNeMo into a full open development platform for biology and drug discovery. BioNeMo includes several open models, which come with open datasets. Among some of the latest additions are a model for predicting 3D structure of RNA molecules, a reasoning model called ReaSyn v2 for ensuring AI-designed molecules are practical to synthesize and another for predicting toxicity, according to Powell. Besides, BioNeMo Recipes will help scale biological foundation model training, customization and deployment.

“Instead of just sending a model over the fence, we’re giving the whole developer community the end-to-end tools accompanied with the data sets, the models themselves, the training recipes and everything in between, so that the full AI life cycle can be taken advantage of and made very easy for the domain experts across the field,” Powell said.

On the robotics front, Multiply Labs, which offers robotic systems for manufacturing gene-modified cell therapies, is using Nvidia’s three physical AI platforms to create digital twins of entire labs, replacing manual, contamination-prone work with autonomous systems. According to Powell, the robotic systems could cut cell therapy manufacturing costs by 70% per dose and increase dose throughput 100-fold per square foot by reducing the need for highly trained personnel and related equipment.

At JPM, Nvidia also announced it is working with Thermo Fisher Scientific to build autonomous lab infrastructure.

“Laboratory automation is not just operational improvement,” Powell said. “It’s a foundational enabler of more intelligent biological AI.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/AI.jpg?VersionId=qZRx1E1XmkVYDa0BpDnarrqnQ59Fbq_e,N,,2026-01-12 11:06:41.710391

Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) is a Google initiative, backed by major retailers

Businesses can target customers with ads designed for AI shoppers

Google has announced plans to take the stress out of online shopping with a new agentic AI ecommerce suite that'll take care of product research, purchasing, and even post-purchase support.

Company VP and GM of Ads & Commerce Vidhya Srinivasan explained in a blog post that the new tools build on 2025's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), designed to offer secure payments within the confines of agentic AI.

The system relies on the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), co-developed by Google and a number of major retail partners like Shopify, Etsy, and Wayfair, so that agents and systems can interact in one ""common language.""

Universal Commerce Protocol is the foundation for agentic AI shopping

Designed to work across multiple industries and platforms, it's also backed by payment companies like Adyen, Amex, Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe - however, from launch we're told it will only be available to eligible US retailers.

The front-end experience revolves around the Gemini app or AI Mode within Google Search. Being that the AI retains information, Google's new shopping assistant will pre-fill the checkout page, and then store the shipping information within Google Wallet.

Along with a later global expansion, the company is also working on a fuller shopping experience such as loyalty reward integration.

At the same time, Google is launching a separate Business Agent that companies can use as their own virtual sales assistants to answer questions about their products. With this tool activated and customized from within the Merchant Center, companies can train the agent on their data, access customer insights and promote related products.

A new Google Ads pilot, Direct Offers, will also target shoppers with exclusive offers that might only be available to shoppers using AI Mode.

However, Google isn't without its competition. OpenAI has already launched similar agentic shopping experiences within ChatGPT, and Microsoft launched a buying experience within Copilot chats with select retailers just days before Google's announcement.

GALWAY, Ireland, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of its MiniMed Go™ app. The MiniMed Go™ Smart Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) system seamlessly integrates the InPen™ smart insulin pen with the Instinct sensor made by Abbott — all connected through the MiniMed Go™ app. This powerful combination delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance, including:

Missed dose alerts to help minimize glucose highs

A dose calculator that simplifies dose decision-making

Action-oriented guidance if a user misses or miscalculates a dose

CareLink™ software reporting for easier provider collaboration

The MiniMed Go™ system is cleared for individuals with insulin-requiring type 1 and type 2 diabetes aged 7 years and older, as well as for children ages 2 to 6 years under the supervision of an adult caregiver. Compatibility of the Simplera™ sensor with MiniMed Go™ is currently under FDA review.

Addressing a Significant Unmet Need

There are more than 15 million people around the world with diabetes who rely on multiple daily injections. For these individuals, mealtimes can feel overwhelming and exhausting — and over time, this can lead to diabetes distress.1,2 This involves determining the amount of carbs in their meal and calculating the right insulin dose to inject before eating (bolus) to keep blood sugar levels in check to avoid dangerous spikes or dips.

Missed boluses can significantly impact diabetes management and glycemic outcomes. Even skipping just two doses a week can raise HbA1C by as much as 0.4%, increasing the risk of both short- and long-term complications.3 Remembering when and how much insulin to dose isn't just a math problem — it's a daily burden that adds stress and fatigue, making diabetes management feel overwhelming.

Real-world data demonstrates that users of the previous generation Medtronic Smart MDI system saw meaningful improvements in glycemic control when consistently responding to actionable alerts. Specifically, the data showed that Time in Range (TIR) increased from 55.7% to 67.2% when users addressed more than 75% of Missed Dose alerts within an hour, and to 71.5% when users addressed Correct High Glucose alerts with a bolus within an hour. These results underscore the power of timely, actionable insights in helping users achieve better glycemic outcomes.4 The new MiniMed Go™ Smart MDI System delivers real-time, personalized insights and actionable guidance to optimize outcomes for users.

""For too long, people using injections have carried the weight of diabetes management without access to the algorithms that make automated insulin delivery systems so powerful,"" said Que Dallara, EVP and president of Medtronic Diabetes and CEO-designate of MiniMed. ""MiniMed Go™ is designed to change that — bringing the smarts of an AID system to individuals who prefer an insulin pen. The system helps take the guesswork out of MDI therapy, delivering simplicity and confidence in every dose. We're pleased to expand our full-stack insulin delivery solutions, making it seamless for our customers to find a therapy that works for them — no matter where they are in their journey.""

We expect the commercial launch of the MiniMed Go™ system to begin in the U.S. this spring. Learn more here about MiniMed Go™.

Five organizations are moving on to the offseason, and we're here to help. I'm going to break down what went wrong for each of those franchises in the wild-card round, how that might have been foreseeable and what they can do to avoid that same fate next season. Fans invariably want to fire coaches and tear up the roster after a playoff loss, but I'll try to be more level-headed or realistic in projecting what might make sense or what these teams might be thinking.

Let's begin with the Chargers, one of two 7-seeds going home.

Jump to a team:

CAR | GB | JAX | LAC | PHI

Los Angeles Chargers

Lost 16-3 vs. Patriots

I'm not sure a Jim Harbaugh quarterback has ever been beaten up in a big game the way Justin Herbert was hit over and over again by the Patriots on Sunday. With an underwhelming run game, an offense that couldn't diagnoseNew England's coverages, a green light to scramble at the first sign of daylight and little in the way of help from his offensive line, Herbert endured 21 hits for the three points the Chargers scored in Foxborough. That number of hits was tied for Herbert's season high and are the most for any Harbaugh-coached QB in a single game going back through his time in San Francisco.

On one hand, you can argue that Herbert put the team on his back because nobody else was capable of doing so. The Chargers struggled to separate from New England's coverage for most of the night. Running backOmarion Hampton was active but playedonly two snaps with an ankle injury, ceding the backfield to Kimani Vidal, who was ineffective. Drops from the likes of Keenan Allen didn't help matters, and Herbert didn't have a single receiver top 32 yards. He scrambled out of duress for gains, but as a passer, Herbert went just 3-of-8 for 21 yards against pressure.

We can also make the case that the Chargers' season really ended when Joe Alt went down for the second time with what would be a season-ending ankle injury. Losing Rashawn Slater(ruptured patellar tendon) was one thing, but going for months without both starting tackles essentially consigned the Chargers' offense to mediocrity. It fell from third in the league in EPA per play with Alt on the field to 26th without him, cycling through various tackles with little success. On Sunday, the Chargers made a Patriots defense that finished the season 23rd in DVOAlook like the 2003 or 2016 Pats defenses, even as New England lostCarlton Davis IIIand Christian Gonzalez for stretches.

There's no doubting Herbert's capacity for greatness, and I'm not going to draw massive conclusions from three disappointing playoff games. But we're about to hit another offseason where the Chargers' primary job will be to fix things around their quarterback. The Tom Telesco regime (2013-23) repeatedly invested in offensive linemen, with Slater proving to be a success, fellow first-rounder Zion Johnson disappointing and free agent addition Corey Linsley making it to a Pro Bowl before having his career derailed by a heart condition. The first-round pick spent on Quentin Johnston in 2023 has fallen somewhere between obvious success and clear bust.

GM Joe Hortiz has continued adding help, and again, the results have been mixed. Ladd McConkey was a hit in the second round of the 2024 draft, although his impact was muted by the addition of Allen in 2025. Oronde Gadsden emerged as a playmaker at tight end, but Bradley Bozeman was disappointing in his second year with the team at center, and the $9.6 million invested inMekhi Becton didn't deliver the guard who impressed with the Eagles a year ago. The new running back room crashed out because of injuries, and it was Vidal -- even after being cut by the team at the end of camp -- who might have looked like their best back for most of the season.

Slater and Alt will be back in 2026, and betweenpass catchers McConkey, Johnston and Gadsden and running backs Vidal and Hampton, the Chargers will have young playmakers on cost-controlled contracts for another year. Hortiz's job will be to fix the interior of the offensive line. I wonder whether he'll look to make a big offer to centerTyler Linderbaum, a player he is familiar with from their time together with the Ravens and one who is set to hit unrestricted free agency. It's difficult to spend big money on interior linemen with Herbert and Slater already on massive deals and Alt coming due for one next year, but the relatively low cost of the Chargers' playmakers might allow for a big contract on the interior. It would be a surprise if Becton was back.

There's also the question of whether the Chargers will return offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who doesn't have many supporters among Chargers fans after Year 2 in Los Angeles. Roman and Harbaugh arrived in town excited at the idea of what Herbert would look like with a run game, but the Chargers rank 27th in success rate on designed runs over Roman's two seasons.

The clock is also ticking on the defensive side of the ball, where coordinator Jesse Minter's ascension to a head-coaching role seems inevitable. Minter and the Chargers have done a fantastic job of getting more out of players than other coaching staffs, with Elijah Molden and Morgan Fox as examples in 2024 and Donte Jackson and Tony Jeffersonin 2025. The Chargers have some young talent on defense between Tuli Tuipulotu, Daiyan Henleyand several standouts in the secondary, but they were also the league'seighth-oldest defenseon a snap-weighted age basis when I looked in mid-December. If Minter leaves, it's unclear whether Harbaugh and Hortiz will be as capable of finding hidden gems around the league with the next coordinator.

All of this leaves the Chargers in a weird place. They're unquestionably a good team with a coach and quarterback who are deservedly held in high regard. They've also been beaten two years in a row in the wild-card round. I'm still optimistic that there's a higher ceiling with the tackles returning in 2026, but Herbert's propensity for taking hits and the potential loss of Minter might cause the defense to offset any potential gains from the offense. There's nothing wrong with being an 11-win team that doesn't make waves in the postseason, but we know Harbaugh and Herbert are capable of more.

Philadelphia Eagles

Lost 23-19 to the 49ers

If you were building a perfect example of what a frustrating 2025 Eagles loss would look like, it would be what we saw against the 49ers on Sunday. A couple of solid early scores before the offense completely shuts down in the third quarter? Check. Frustrating penalties that wipe away big plays? Check. An offense missing Lane Johnson? A missed kick by Jake Elliott that changed the late-game calculus? An excellent defense let down in spots by its weakest links on the back end? An end-of-game sequence in which the passing game sputters with drops and low-percentage throws? Check, check, check and check.

The Eagles have played variants of this game against good teams for most of the season, with a few breaks going one way or the other late to decide who wins. Things might have been different if Jalen Hurts had been able to escape the pocket and scramble for what looked to be an easy first down in the final sequence, only for 49ers midseason addition Keion White to trip him up for a loss of 1 yard. Instead of being in a first-and-goal situation with three timeouts, the Eagles were stuck in second-and-long and didn't pick up a single yard the rest of the way.

Against a 49ers team that has been battered by injuries and lost George Kittle to a season-ending torn Achilles in the first half, it was notable how the Eagles suffered when their weaker starters and depth players were brought into focus. The 49ers hit a pair of big plays in the first half when the deep safety in the middle of the field -- first Marcus Epps, then Reed Blankenship -- was simply unable to slow down a receiver and allowed significant yards after the catch in the process. Those plays amounted to 106 of San Francisco's 186 yards in the first half, setting it up for 10 points.

Blankenship simply stopped running on a trick play, with Christian McCaffreyzooming by him to catch a touchdown pass from receiverJauan Jennings. Nakobe Dean couldn't hang in coverage on McCaffrey for the winning touchdown. Fred Johnson, playing right tackle for the injured Lane Johnson, committed a false start that pushed the Eagles backward on third down and allowed the only sack of the game for Philly's offense. When you consider what the 49ers got from guys such asEric Kendricks, Garret Wallowand Demarcus Robinson on Sunday, the gap between the marginal players taking meaningful snaps on the two rosters and how they played was significant.

Is that on coaching? It has to be, at least in part. Kyle Shanahan and Robert Saleh did an excellent job of getting the most out of the talent they had, a job that became even more difficult for the 49ers head coach when Kittle went down early in the game and took a part of the playbook with him. The Niners were able to find answers by repeatedly targetingAdoree' Jacksonand attacking the Eagles underneath, where Philly blew coverages and couldn't get close as it tried to tackle McCaffrey and Kyle Juszczyk at times.

Saleh's defense leaned into the blitz, trusting that Hurts and Philly's two star wideouts wouldn't be able to make them pay. That plan paid off, as Hurts went 6-of-11 for just 48 yards against the blitz. Even when the 49ers didn't send the house, the threat of the blitz caused the Eagles to question their looks and check into plays that weren't necessarily great fits for what the 49ers ran post-snap. And after Deommodore Lenoir blew contain on the second run of the game and allowed Saquon Barkley to run for 29 yards, the 49ers limited the Philly run game to 109 yards on 34 carries, or 3.2 yards per pop.

For the majority of this season, it has seemed like the Eagles believed they were going to win on sheer talent, that their stars would make more big plays than yours. There was nothing to fix with the run game, because this had been one of the best offensive lines in football with Lane Johnson on the field. Brown and Smith were uncoverable at their best. Hurts was a serial winner. The Eagles ran one of the most static pre-snap offenses in football and were comfortable with Hurts attacking blitzes with low-percentage throws downfield because they believed their guys were going to win.

The results spoke for themselves until they didn't, and the core of general manager Howie Roseman's Eagles teams -- the offensive and defensive lines -- wasn't up to the task. The Eagles went 8-2 with Lane Johnson and 3-5 without him, as the legendary right tackle never made it back from his midseason Lisfranc injury. Hurts posted a 64.3 QBR with Johnson on the field and a 49.7 mark without him. The Eagles were the league's fifth-worst rushing attack in terms of success rate without Johnson. His absence wasn't the only issue, as Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens both struggled through frustrating seasons, but the Eagles simply didn't have the same dominant O-line that they had in 2024, and they never really found a way to account or adjust for those issues.

And while Roseman hit on the midseason addition of Jaelan Phillips, who gave an inconsistent pass rush a much-needed boost of pressure, the Eagles' offseason moves didn't necessarily age well. Zack Baun wasn't the same linebacker in his second season with Philadelphia and got juked out of the play several times in the loss to the 49ers. Some of the depth guys brought in to replace the departed Josh Sweat, such as Za'Darius Smith, Joshua Ucheand Azeez Ojulari, struggled to make an impact amid injuries (and an unexpected retirement for Smith). First-round pick Jihaad Campbell lost his role in the lineup once Dean returned from injury and played just one defensive snap against the Niners. The next defenders off the board were Carson Schwesinger, who is a Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate in Cleveland, and Nick Emmanwori, who has been a physical force at safety for Seattle.

But at the end of the day, this has to fall on the coaching staff, specifically the offensive brain trust of head coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. The Eagles simply didn't develop any new answers as the season went along, and while we don't know how things would have gone if Lane Johnson had actually made it back, the Eagles' offense wasn't really all that great with him in the fold, either. It certainly wasn't up to what we saw last season, when Kellen Moore was in Patullo's role and merged the offense he ran in Dallas and Los Angeles with what the Eagles ran under Sirianni.

Should the Eagles fire Sirianni? I laid out many of the pros and cons for him in November, and there's no arguing that his résumé through five seasons is essentially unprecedented in modern football. He deserves some credit for how well things went in 2022 and 2024, and some blame for the disappointing endings in 2023 and 2025. The Eagles could try to bring back former special teams coordinator John Harbaugh, but Ravens fans would have many of the same complaints about their former coach that Eagles fans have about their current leader.

I'd be surprised if the Eagles moved on from Sirianni. It's tough to see Patullo returning, and given that Moore and Shane Steichen have earned head coaching gigs from running this offense, it should be an appealing opportunity for offensive minds. It would seem aggressive to make massive personnel changes, but Roseman has never shied away from making moves before. And I wonder whether the Eagles will look to potentially tradeA.J. Brown, who had his least efficient season as an Eagles player, repeatedly seemed to butt heads with the organization and turns 29 in June.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Lost 27-24 vs. Bills

After what has been an excellent debut season as a head coach in Jacksonville, I'm worried Liam Coen is going to be sick for weeks. The Jaguars let this game get away from them in a way that I would not have anticipated. On a day whenTrevor Lawrence struggled with consistency and went 18-of-30 for 207 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions, the Jags simply didn't run the ball often enough.

It's one thing to get away from the run when an offense doesn't have success or is facing a team that has a solid run defense, but neither of those things were true. The Bills' rush defense -- which ranked 31st in EPA per play against designed runs -- was their obvious weakness heading into the game. And the Jaguars boomed on the ground on their first touchdown drive, as Bhayshul Tuten racked up consecutive carries of 20, 14 and 13 yards. Inexplicably, the rookie got just one carry the rest of the way.

The duo of Tuten andTravis Etienne Jr.combined for just 14 carries, which they turned into 118 yards and a 71% success rate. By EPA per designed rush by running backs, this was the 13th-most-efficient rushing performance of the season in any game by any set of backs. The Jags simply didn't get to it enough.

Raw rush totals can be misleading. Lawrence kept on a zone-read on fourth-and-short when he would have handed the ball off if Joey Bosa hadn't crashed down. Teams can run RPOs and throw their way out of run looks if they get the right movement. We saw the Panthers throw a pair of slants to Tetairoa McMillan that were tagged onto their run plays for easy completions. And if a defense is loading up with heavy boxes and daring teams to throw, running for the sake of running isn't a good idea.

But the Bills weren't doing that. The Jags didn't run into a single loaded box with Etienne or Tuten all game. Nine of those 14 carries went into light boxes, which helped their efficiency and hinted toward how the Bills were willing to approach this game on defense. Looking at Lawrence's first-and-10 dropbacks that weren't near the goal line or in the two-minute drill, there were plenty of run-friendly boxes that the Jags chose not to hit.

Given how Lawrence played Sunday, that was a missed opportunity. He came into the postseason on fire and playing the best football of his career, but as I highlighted last week, that doesn't always lead to the same success in the postseason.

Lawrence had a 15-2 touchdown-interception ratio during the final nine games of the 2022 season, then threw five picks in two playoff games, including four in the Jags' dramatic comeback win over the Chargers. After posting a 15-1 ratio over the final six games of 2025, Lawrence threw two picks in Sunday's loss, including one on the first play of the season-ending drive. He failed to convert on the aforementioned fourth-and-2 zone-read attempt, as well. Lawrence still made a handful of nice throws, especially when targeting slot receiver Parker Washington, but his 30.2 Total QBR ranked ninth among the 10 quarterbacks who have played in the wild-card round so far.

While the Jags led 24-20 with 4:03 to go after Lawrence found Etienne for a touchdown, the Josh Allen drive that followed felt almost inevitable. The Jaguars have a solid defense, but their secondary needs the pass rush to create problems. Instead, Allen went 9-of-12 for 144 yards under pressure, including a spectacular throw against an unblocked rusher to Brandin Cooks on a post route for 36 yards, which got the Bills into the red zone for the game-winning touchdown.

Even as Allen completed passes to nine different receivers and top target Khalil Shakir was mostly catching screens and hitches, the Bills were able to attack outside cornerbacks Jarrian Jones andGreg Newsome IIin coverage. Jones also struggled with his tackling after the catch. Allen was 10-of-11 on out-breaking routes, repeatedly trusting his ability to throw the ball into places Jacksonville's defenders couldn't reach. And to mitigate the pass rush, Allen got the ball out in less than 2.5 seconds on nearly half of his attempts, going 16-of-17 for 173 yards and a touchdown on those throws.

This was a successful year for the Jaguars, but I'm not sure it went the way Coen and first-year general manager James Gladstone would have imagined. Gladstone swore to take big swings in his new role, and some of those swings hit. Jakobi Meyers was wildly successful after being acquired at the trade deadline, earning an extension. Slot corner Jourdan Lewis was excellent early in the season before hitting injured reserve twice. Center Robert Hainsey had a very solid year after following Coen over from Tampa Bay.

And yet some of the more high-profile moves the Jags made didn't really work out. Newsome, acquired in a midseason trade for Tyson Campbell, allowed a107.5 passer ratingin coverage. Dyami Brown, signed to a one-year, $10 million deal, racked up 227 receiving yards and was a healthy scratch late in the year. Really, much of the new regime's success came in getting more out of the players who were already in the building, includingCole Van Lanen, Devin Lloyd, Etienne, Lawrence and Arik Armstead--all of whom played much better in 2025.

The biggest move the Jags made, of course, was trading two first-round picks for hybrid uber-prospect Travis Hunter. The early returns on that move aren't looking great. Hunter didn't play like a first-rounder at wide receiver or cornerback, although he did have 101 yards against the Rams in his final game before suffering a season-ending knee injury in practice. The Jaguars didn't seem to have a consistent usage plan for Hunter, and while the first-rounder they sent to the Browns to acquire him will fall late in the first round at No. 24, I'm not sure that trade looks all that great after one season.

Hunter still deserves time to develop, and the Jags surely would have loved to have him at cornerback against the Bills on Sunday, but their future plans for him could determine what happens this offseason. It seems likely that the Jags will move forward with Hunter playing regularly at cornerback, where they'll have an opening, especially if Newsome is allowed to hit free agency.

What about wide receiver, though? In Hunter's absence, the Jaguars got their passing game going by getting two other wideouts on the field. Meyers emerged as a standout, but so did Washington, who produced a mammoth run of games down the stretch. Underappreciated frankly by both the current and prior regimes in Jacksonville, Washington was buried on the depth chart after the additions of Hunter, Brown and Meyers.

Once Hunter was injured and Brown was taken out of the lineup, though, Washington proved that he belongs on the field. He had 145 receiving yards in the Jags' December win over the Broncos, then followed with a 115-yard day against the Colts and 87 yards against the Titans. Washington was then the Jags' leading receiver on Sunday, turning a team-high 12 targets into 107 yards and a touchdown. With one more year left on his rookie deal, Washington has earned a regular role in the lineup when Jacksonville is in three-wide sets.

The investment made in Hunter also implies that he's going to be a part of the offense, which leaves me with questions about the one player I haven't mentioned.Brian Thomas Jr.came into the year as Jacksonville's top wideout after an impressive rookie season, but amid early issues with drops, he seemed to fade out of that lead role in the offense. Meyers and Washington took over as Lawrence's top target for stretches in the second half. Thomas averaged 46.6 receiving yards per game over the final eight games of the season, and despite an early touchdown catch for Jacksonville's first score Sunday, he finished with only two receptions for 21 yards.

The new regime inherited Thomas, and he didn't appear a natural fit in Year 1 with Coen. Would the Jaguars consider trading him? The 2024 first-rounder is the most natural fit as the ""X"" receiver in Coen's offense, and I'm not sure any of the other guys are obvious replacements for him in that role. Plus, Thomas was so talented as a rookie that I'd want to try to make it work for another season.

If the Jags can recoup the first-round pick they sent away for Hunter, though, trading Thomas might be worth serious consideration. And the obvious landing spot, coincidentally enough, would be with the team that just beat them. Buffalo doesn't have that young playmaker who can win against man coverage at wide receiver, and Thomas would be a major upgrade on what already appears to be a failed experiment in Keon Coleman. The Bills will also have their first-rounder fall toward the end of the round, which would probably be a fair price for Thomas. It's an unlikely move, of course, but Jacksonville has four starters for three wideout spots, and Thomas is the player who would have the most trade value and who the Jags have seen the least out of in 2025.

A notable starter whose future is more likely to be elsewhere in 2026 is Walker Little. The prior front office signed the 2021 second-round pick to a three-year, $40.5 million deal after just a handful of starts at left tackle. Little began the year on Lawrence's blind side, but when he suffered a concussion in a November win over the Titans, the Jags installed Van Lanen at left tackle. The utility player was enough of an upgrade that the Jags signed him to a three-year, $51 million deal and kept him at left tackle when Little returned. (Little moved to right guard to take over for the injured Patrick Mekari.)

Van Lanen missed Sunday's loss with a knee injury, with Little back to his old spot and committing two false starts. The commitment to Van Lanen suggests that the Jags see him as a left tackle candidate in 2026. With Little's $11 million base salary guaranteed next season, it would hardly be a surprise if the Jaguars traded him to clear out a starting spot and get some cash to put toward free agent additions this offseason.

Green Bay Packers

Lost 31-27 vs. Bears

Sunday's loss brought an end to a five-week collapse for the Packers, who walked off the field after Keisean Nixon's interception sealed a win over the Bears in early December with hopes of winning the NFC North. That dramatic victory was their last of the season, as the Packers lost their final five games, including the wild-card matchup Saturday. Along the way, they lost Micah Parsonsto a knee injury, lost (then regained) Jordan Loveto a concussionand blew two different games with a 95% or better win expectancy in the fourth quarter to the Bears. The first pushed the NFC North back to Chicago, and the second might have ended Matt LaFleur's run as Green Bay's head coach.

There has been smoke around the coach's future in Green Bay over the past few weeks, and there are plans to talk after the season about extending the contracts of LaFleur and general manager Brian Gutekunst, both of whom are entering the final year of their respective pacts. I'd argue that they're two of the best at their respective roles. I'm just not sure Packers fans would agree with that sentiment at the moment.

At halftime of Saturday night's game, of course, LaFleur looked like he might earn a new deal in the locker room. It seemed like the Packers had outprepared, outschemed and outplayed the Bears, who were flailing on fourth downs and struggling to live up to the moment. Chicago coach Ben Johnson wasn't able to get his ground game going, had dialed up just one play-action pass for Caleb Williamsand couldn't rely at all on his defense to slow down the Packers. Love and the Green Bay offense scored touchdowns on their first three drives, and while Brandon McManus missed a 55-yard field goal to end the half, the Packers were up 21-3 and getting the ball to start the third quarter. One missed kick wasn't going to matter, right?

Well, three missed kicks mattered, as McManus missed another field goal and an extra point, costing the Packers seven points in a game they lost by four. He was a savior for the Packers last season when he produced an outlier season in terms of accuracy, but the Packers brought McManus back for 2025 with underwhelming results; he had the fifth-worst field goals made over expectation (per NFL Next Gen Stats) of any kicker, even before his postseason disappointment. Would he have had a better chance of making those kicks at home?

The Bears found their rhythm on offense, as they scored on five of their six possessions in the second half, racking up 333 net yards and 28 points. The Packers, decidedly, did not. The offense went to sleep for its first four possessions in the second half, as Green Bay amassed 29 yards and one first down across a four-drive stretch.

Much of that owed to a rushing attack that simply stopped. Josh Jacobs was solid early in this game, but the 2024 free agent addition and the offensive line could not conspire to threaten the line of scrimmage for most of the contest. Jacobs finished with 19 carries for 55 yards, but his final 14 totes produced just 16 yards and one first down. Jacobs was stopped on a second-and-3, a third-and-1 and two carries from the 1-yard line. And pressed into action as a kickoff returner, he fumbled, with the Packers fortunate to fall on the football. Jacobs was returning from a knee injury, but if he wasn't 100 percent, it was on LaFleur to find other solutions, either by using other backs or leaning into the pass on early downs.

Jeff Hafley has earned head coaching consideration for his work with the Packers' defense over the past two years, but this also wasn't his best showing. The Packers were able to get off the field on fourth down against the Bears in the first half, but frankly, that was more a product of Chicago's clumsiness than great defensive play. Bears center Drew Dalman fired a snap wide of Williams to throw off the timing on one failed fourth-down play, while Dalman and right guard Jonah Jackson failed to block defensive tackle Karl Brooks on another, allowing the Packers lineman to run totally unbothered up the A-gap at Williams for a drive-ending pressure. Williams finished the first half 8-of-17 for 78 yards with an interception, and it seemed like Hafley might finish the night with a head coaching offer or two.

After the break, Hafley's defense wasn't able to consistently slow down the Bears. The Packers weren't able to create post-snap problems for Williams and the passing game. There's nothing wrong with rotation safeties and trying to show a different post-snap look, but it led to snaps in which the Packers weren't in position to succeed. On the first third down of the third quarter, the Packers showed a two-high look before the snap and then blitzed safetyXavier McKinney from 11 yards off the line of scrimmage. McKinney never got close to Williams, and the Packers were outnumbered on a flood combination to that side of the field, producing an easy 19-yard completion to tight endColston Loveland.

Loveland picked up another big play on the same drive when the Packers spun their safeties before the snap and nobody ran with his crossing route. The rookie tight end was a mismatch when the Packers did get somebody on him -- Loveland was simply too athletic for Quay Walker--but the Packers made their own mistakes. On a critical third-and-4 before the winning touchdown, the Packers responded to an empty formation by dropping their defensive backs past the sticks and asking edge rusher Kingsley Enagbare to get into the flat to cover running backD'Andre Swift. Williams went right to Swift for an easy 23-yard gain. One play later, the Bears had the lead.

That final play saw the Bears take advantage of the position that has been the weak spot on the Packers' roster since the start of the season. Carrington Valentine was supposed to be booted out of the starting lineup by the arrival of free agent slot corner Nate Hobbs, but Hobbs was ineffective and injured for most of his debut season in Green Bay. Valentine has allowed a121.2 passer ratingin his stead, and he came up lacking on the last snap of the Packers' season.

For all the complaints about Ben Johnson's playcalling being too cute, this was an example of the details selling the right lie to the right player. The Bears lined up with trips to the left and an unbalanced line, giving them an extra blocker to the side of the field in tackle Darnell Wright. The look screamed some sort of screen, and early in the game, the Bears had thrown a screen on third-and-8 out of that same bunch for a first down.

This time, though, the Bears were taking a shot downfield. Williams fired his hips toward the tunnel screen without ever really throwing the ball, but that was enough. Valentine drove on the screen, and by the time he turned around, the ball was already coming out.DJ Moorehad dropped a spectacular throw from Williams earlier in the drive, but this time, the wide-open veteran brought in a fade for the winning touchdown.

Injuries and absences mattered. LinebackerEdgerrin Cooper leaving in the third quarter because of an ankle injury cost the Packers arguably their best remaining player on the defense. Isaiah McDuffie filled in and wasn't able to tackle Bears running backKyle Monangai on a critical checkdown that turned into a 22-yard completion and set up a touchdown. LinebackerNick Niemann, who hadn't played a single defensive snap all season, was isolated in coverage against Loveland on the 2-point try that made it a three-point game.

And the Packers sorely missed Parsons, the player for whom Gutekunst sent two first-round picks to acquire. They pressured Williams on 25% of his dropbacks, but the Packers had just two quick pressures on 48 opportunities, meaning that most of the times they bothered Williams came late in the play. Parsons averaged more than two quick pressures per game on his own this season. Could those pressures have helped swing this game toward Green Bay?

The Packers did have a chance to win the game after the Moore touchdown, but sloppy game management from LaFleur limited what they could do. It's always easier to evaluate timeout usage after the fact, when we know how the game ends, but it's impossible to suggest that LaFleur got anything close to full value for the three he had in the second half.

Green Bay used its first on offense with 3:02 left, a stopped clock and a three-point lead to avoid a delay of game penalty. That's fine, but the Packers promptly went back to the line after the timeout and took a delay of game penalty, costing them 5 yards. After an incompletion on third down, LaFleur had the impossible choice between kicking a field goal to go up six (often seen as a net negative by win expectancy models, because it incentivizes the other team to go for a touchdown) or attempt a fourth-and-15. He got neither, and the Bears scored a touchdown anyway.

LaFleur had to use his second timeout on defense with 2:08 to go, this time because the Packers couldn't get the right players on the field. The timeout stopped the clock for the Bears and gave them the ability to open up the playbook to call a run just before the two-minute warning, which they took advantage of to pick up 5 yards.

The Packers were left with one timeout for their final drive, which they used after a short competition to Romeo Doubs. They were then forced to run 10 seconds off the clock after an injury to center Sean Rhyan. In the end, they never even got an opportunity to run a play within the red zone before time expired, coming closest when Love nearly squeezed a pass between three Tampa 2 defenders toChristian Watsoninside the 5-yard line.

It's a frustrating loss at the end of a frustrating losing streak. It's the third straight year the Packers have entered the postseason as the 7-seed, and LaFleur has a grand total of one playoff win over the past five seasons. Should what Packers fans saw from their coach Saturday serve as proof that Green Bay needs to go in a different direction?

I would say no. LaFleur has gone 76-40-1 as a head coach despite fielding what were often underwhelming defenses over that stretch, an issue I would blame more on Joe Barry than him. There have been a couple of rough losses in the postseason, and I'm not sure I'll ever understand LaFleur kicking a field goal down eight late against the Bucs with the greatest red zone offense in league history in the 2020 playoffs, but there's a real value in having a coach who gets you to the playoffs just about every year. LaFleur's work with Malik Willis and building a functional offense around a quarterback who looked unplayable in Tennessee is a testament to his offensive mind.

The story seems the same for the Packers because it is the same. They're a good team stuck in a tough division. They're the youngest team in the league on an annual basis, as Gutekunst strips the oldest players from the roster and loads up on draft picks. The difference was supposed to be Parsons, the true superstar who would elevate the rest of the defense, help mask the weaknesses at cornerback and come up with big plays when the Packers needed them most. And for three-plus months, Parsons lived up to expectations. There's no good time to tear an ACL, but Parsons doing so one month before the playoffs was always going to have a dramatic impact on Green Bay's ceiling. I wouldn't fire LaFleur or Gutekunst because their most important addition tore an ACL.

Instead, I suspect it will be an offseason of retooling. This offseason might be the end of the line in Green Bay for 30-year-old lineman Elgton Jenkins, who has a $24.8 million cap hit next season. Hobbs and 28-year-old guard Aaron Banks, who was in and out of the lineup because of injuries, could be one-and-done in Green Bay, although I'd be surprised if Banks was released. Doubs, who had a fantastic catch in a key moment, is likely to leave in free agency, which will help the Packers recoup some of the draft capital they lost as part of the Parsons deal via compensatory picks. The Packers were also 26th in special teams win probability during the regular season, which might create problems for coordinator Rich Bisaccia.

Outside of the very top teams in football, a lot of organizations would and should look enviously at what the Packers have built. I think we need to see what that looks like in the postseason with a healthy Parsons before making any sort of snap judgments about whether Green Bay is better off with another head coach.

Carolina Panthers

Lost 34-31 vs. Rams

There are no moral victories in the playoffs, but for the Panthers, this might have been the closest thing to one. They were massive underdogs at home even after beating the Rams in Carolina this season, and expectations of repeating that feat in the rematch were low. When the Panthers quickly went down 14-0 after a failed fourth-down conversion and a Bryce Young interception handed the Rams a pair of short fields, a blowout victory for Los Angeles appeared to be on the horizon.

Instead, the Panthers came all the way back to take the lead with 2:39 to go before the defense allowed the game-winning touchdown drive toMatthew Stafford. The veteran quarterback reportedly told receiverDavante Adams he was going to ""snatch [ the Panthers' ] hearts"" on the final drive. A cold line, no doubt, but one you save for the Super Bowl when you know the NFL Films microphones are on the sideline, right? Stafford had to pull out his best material late in the wild-card round, both on and off the field, to get the Rams to the next round.

I'm weirdly more optimistic about the Panthers after their playoff loss than I was after their win over the Rams in Week 13, because the factors that led to that win were unsustainable. The Panthers converted all three of their fourth-down tries, including two for long touchdown passes. With a Mike Jackson pick-six leading the way, the Panthers posted a plus-three turnover margin in the win; the last time that happened was in the Matt Rhule era with Baker Mayfield at quarterback, more than three years ago. Those plays matter and are meaningful, but I'm not sure they're particularly sustainable as a formula for beating the Rams.

And in those same spots Sunday, the Panthers' timing wasn't quite as impeccable. They went 0-for-3 on fourth down. Young threw an early pick to the Rams on a play in which Panthers receiverJalen Coker, who otherwise had a breakout game, seemed to be on the wrong page after some pre-snap adjustments and stopped his route. Carolina rookie Trevor Etienne muffed a punt to give the Rams another short field, and while the Panthers got another Jackson interception and blocked a punt in the fourth quarter, the turnover margin for this game went down in Los Angeles' favor.

Instead, this Panthers performance shined through the full 60 minutes, as they went toe-to-toe with the Rams on a down-by-down basis. They struggled early on defense, with Rams receiverPuka Nacua moving around the formation and flummoxing Carolina's zone coverage looks, but defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero and his cornerbacks held up against Nacua and Adams and forced Stafford into what seemed like an endless run of contested throws to either sideline. They rode their luck a bit when Nacua dropped a would-be touchdown just before halftime, but the Panthers were able to limit explosive rushing plays and didn't allow a single drive over 50 yards before the fourth quarter.

And on a day whenChuba Hubbard and Rico Dowdle combined for 55 yards on 18 carries and the Panthers trailed by 14 points midway through the first quarter, so much of the game fell on Young's shoulders. His offensive line was a mess. Guard Robert Hunt tried to return early from a pectoral injury and clearly wasn't his usual self. The Panthers lost left tackle Ikem Ekwonu to a ruptured patellar tendon early in the game, and replacement Yosh Nijman allowed four of the 14 quick pressures generated by the Rams (per NFL Next Gen Stats), which tied for the fifth-most quick pressures in any game all season.

Under the circumstances, I thought Young was excellent. The raw numbers aren't going to wow anyone, with the 2023 No. 1 draft pick completing 52.5% of his passes and averaging 6.6 yards per attempt, but his 74.4 Total QBR attests to how well he played given the pressure rate. He was repeatedly able to buy time and create out of structure, looking almost Tony Romo-esque as he spun his way out of interior pressure and got out of the pocket to find receivers.

When Young wasn't pressured, he went 17-of-24 for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick. He threw with anticipation to set up two chunk plays to Coker, who finished with nine catches for 134 yards and the touchdown that gave the Panthers their fourth-quarter lead. Young is never going to have the strongest arm, so he needs to anticipate voids before they come open, throw accurate passes to create YAC and create out of structure. He did all three Saturday.

I'm not suggesting that Young's fifth-year option was on the line in this game, because the indications were already that the Panthers were going to pick up Young's $26.5 million guarantee for 2027. If Young had suffered through a disastrous game (think Sam Darnold's final start with the Vikings), though, that pickup might have come through gritted teeth. This was Young's most important start in a Panthers uniform, and he came through impressively.

This is the first offseason in many years in which the Panthers won't have to make fixing the offense their primary focus. Acquiring a quarterback was problem No. 1, and they've spent the past two offseasons desperately trying to get the right players around Young. Some of those moves haven't hit, but enough have left the offense in solid shape. Coker and presumptive Offensive Rookie of the Year Tetairoa McMillan are the two young wideouts the Panthers have been hoping to find. They'll also have Jonathon Brooks as the second back alongside Hubbard to replace Dowdle next season.

There's still work to be done, of course. Ekwonu is likely out six to 12 months, and the Panthers are on the hook for his $17.6 million fifth-year option in 2026. Nijman, a pending free agent, was a turnstile when forced into the lineup at left tackle, so the Panthers probably need a short-term stopgap there if Ekwonu is not ready to go. Adding a tight end might also be on the docket if the Panthers weren't impressed by Ja'Tavion Sanders' second season.

But really, this should be an offseason finally devoted toward adding defense. The Panthers signed Tershawn Wharton and Tre'von Moehrig in free agency, but when they used a second-round pick on edge Nic Scourton, it marked the first time Carolina had used a first- or second-round pick on a defensive player since selecting Jaycee Horn in 2021.

The Panthers like their young talent on defense, but this would be about finding more significant solutions for some of their veterans on short-term, low-cost contracts. Ironically, two are former Rams in safetyNick Scottand linebacker Christian Rozeboom, both of whom were targeted by L.A. in coverage Sunday. No Carolina defender managed more than five sacks, so finding a veteran (or a first-round pick) on the edge who can create more pass pressure alongside Scourton and Princely Umanmielen would be a welcome addition.

It's important to be realistic about where the Panthers are and what they've shown. This team finished 25th in DVOA and ESPN's Football Power Index. It was 8-9 against one of the league's easier schedules, the same performance that led the Falcons to fire Raheem Morris after two seasons in Atlanta. And after no-showing in a win-and-in game against the Buccaneers last week, the Panthers needed Morris and his Falcons to beat the Saints (something they weren't able to do in their two meetings) to back into the postseason.

And yet there are meaningful signs of growth. The Panthers finished 21st in weighted DVOA, and while that's not going to push coach Dave Canales into the Hall of Fame, it's a sign that they were improving as the season went along. They beat the Packers and Rams and came within a defensive stop of beating what might be the league's best team a second time. If they can stack a second effective offseason in a row, the Panthers might be in position to take over Tampa Bay's spot as the presumptive favorite in the NFC South in the years to come.

ID31,New York Public Library,2026-01-12 13:28:44+00:00,United States Patent and Trademark Office,Lighting the way | USPTO,Not Available,,,,,https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/journeys-innovation/statue-of-liberty,"In 1871, reeling from the aftermath of this conflict, Bartholdi made the decision to travel to the United States.
Purportedly, Bartholdi imagined the “majestic figure of Liberty towering with her torch” and “lighting the crowded harbor, with its tributary rivers and the vast, blackened cities on their borders, the very image of a teeming, populous miniature world.” America, however, had some practical concerns.
Design patent protection was extremely well-suited for Bartholdi’s goals.
And design patents were considered fairly straightforward to apply for and receive, a characteristic reflected in Bartholdi’s patent application files.
The patent for the statue’s bust was granted on November 5, less than a month after the application was submitted.","In 1865, the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment abolished the institution of slavery in the United States. Following these world-changing events, French political thinker and abolitionist Edouard de Laboulaye first proposed presenting a monument to the United States to commemorate this triumph of human freedom. De Laboulaye intended for the monument itself to be a gift from France, a gesture of friendship between two nations who fought side-by-side in the war for American independence nearly a century prior. A strong advocate for democracy, he also hoped the monument would spark anew a desire for freedom among the people of France.

Bartholdi’s first proposed location for his massive statue was the newly opened Suez Canal, and although this project never progressed beyond sketches, his depiction of a female figure on a pedestal holding a torch aloft struck familiar notes. After more than a decade focusing on artistic endeavors and attempts to find a potential home for such a structure, Bartholdi’s work was interrupted by his duties as an officer in the Franco-Prussian War. He watched as his home region was annexed by Germany and his nation was thrown into political turmoil. In 1871, reeling from the aftermath of this conflict, Bartholdi made the decision to travel to the United States. Prior to his trip, he met with de Laboulaye, and the pair reaffirmed their now joint goal to convince both France and America to support and finance the statue.

Bartholdi had multiple goals for his trip to America, but one of the most important was to scout prospective locations for the statue. An 1886 article in The Columbian described the sculptor’s “moment of inspiration,” which came on a “beautiful spring morning” while he was a passenger on a steamship traveling into New York Bay. Purportedly, Bartholdi imagined the “majestic figure of Liberty towering with her torch” and “lighting the crowded harbor, with its tributary rivers and the vast, blackened cities on their borders, the very image of a teeming, populous miniature world.”

America, however, had some practical concerns. A handbook produced by Statue of Liberty National Monument cites a few potential reasons for the lack of enthusiasm amongst Americans for funding the pedestal. Some took issue with the Statue’s proposed location, either believing discussion should be opened to alternative cities or unwilling to donate their money for what they viewed as a statue for New York City alone. Others, however, struggled to believe that the behemoth statue would ever be completed. With the statue being constructed an ocean away, Bartholdi found that his sketches and scale models were not enough to capture American confidence.

During the month that Bartholdi displayed the statue at the Centennial Exposition, he also sold photographs and even scrap metal from the torch in order to raise funds for the pedestal. The nation’s press took notice, with coverage of Bartholdi’s visit found in newspapers from Massachusetts, Ohio, Wisconsin, and of course, New York. In a letter to the editor in the New York Tribune, one citizen asked how to subscribe to help raise funds for the pedestal, proclaiming, “We should consider it an honor and a privilege to each contribute our share of the cost... What better memorial of the Centennial year could Americans inaugurate than this!”

The Centennial Exposition officially ended on November 10, 1876, but fundraising for the pedestal continued. For the next six years, the arm and torch found a home in New York’s Madison Square Park. In January of 1877, the statue’s advocates formed the American Committee of the Statue of Liberty. When Bartholdi returned to France to supervise the construction of the rest of his colossus, he designated the Committee’s secretary, Richard Butler, as his proxy in the United States. Looking to capitalize on the success of mementos from the Centennial, the Committee began selling scale models and photographs of the Statue in order to raise funds. However, this presented a new conundrum.

One tool Bartholdi used to protect against copycats were design patents. A fairly new form of intellectual property protection at the time, design patents were first authorized by Congress in 1842 to protect an article of manufacture where the novelty and value was in its appearance rather than the function. Technological advances in manufacturing allowed for cast iron pieces, textiles, and statuary to be both more intricately designed and more efficiently produced, and the artisans creating these pieces lobbied for a way to protect their unique patterns and embellishments. By the time Bartholdi applied for his first patent, more than 1,000 design patents had been granted by the Patent Office.

Design patent protection was extremely well-suited for Bartholdi’s goals. As he was seeking to protect the design of the statuettes and images used for fundraising, rather than the statue itself, they were considered an article of manufacture, making any potential infringements easier to navigate. The fourteen-year limit on the protection afforded by the patents did not pose an issue, as Bartholdi’s goal was to raise the necessary funds as quickly as possible. And design patents were considered fairly straightforward to apply for and receive, a characteristic reflected in Bartholdi’s patent application files.

On October 16, 1878, Bartholdi submitted his first patent application for the design of an ornamental bust, retaining the services of a New York City law firm, S.H. Wales & Son, and paying the required fee of $45. His description highlights many of the statue’s familiar features, including the head “surmounted” by a “diadem, from which rays proceed,” the “eyes having a distant gaze,” and the statue’s countenance “with an air of dignity and determination, symbolic of Liberty and Enlightenment.”

Bartholdi’s attorneys submitted a single amendment on October 22. Apparently, Bartholdi had originally used only his last name to sign the patent petition, and it was a requirement of the Patent Office that an inventor’s full name be included. The anglicized spelling of “August” was subsequently scrawled in red pencil anywhere Bartholdi’s name appeared.

The patent for the statue’s bust was granted on November 5, less than a month after the application was submitted. Bartholdi must have found the process and benefits of patent protection effective, for he submitted a second patent application for the full statue just months later, on January 2, 1879.

On January 14, the patent examiner assigned the patent wrote to Bartholdi with his objections. The first was a matter of word choice; Bartholdi had initially written “the design may be executed in whole or in part glyptically,” and the examiner stated that the word “glyptically” was “not to be found in the English language.” This line was amended to “any manner known to the glyptic art” in the final version. The examiner also asked Bartholdi to make one of his claims more specific. As it was written, they found the works more aligned with the “proper subject matter of copyright and not of letters patent.” In response, Bartholdi’s attorneys submitted their amendments, and the design for a statue was patented on February 18.

Nationalizing the fundraising drive while keeping the interest of the New Yorkers, who were consistently providing the majority of the funds, was one of the main challenges of the Committee. At various times during the statue’s construction, other cities around the nation expressed interest in providing a home for Lady Liberty within their borders. Bartholdi used this to his advantage, cleverly motivating New Yorkers by implying that Philadelphia might be permitted to keep the statue if they did not raise the necessary funds. And when Boston tossed themselves into the arena as an option, it ignited a rivalry between the two cities, both steeped in Revolutionary War history. A New York Times article in 1882 responded to Boston’s offer, leaving little of the city’s sentiment up for interpretation: “We have more than a million people in this City who are resolved that that great light-house shall be smashed into minute fragments before it shall be stuck up in Boston Harbor.”

When sales of the statuettes slowed and the pedestal was still nowhere near completion, the statue’s champions turned to other creative fundraising avenues. In 1883, the Pedestal Fund Art Loan Exhibition launched, a collection of paintings, sculptures, musical instruments, costumes, furniture, literary works, and items for daily use. “In assembling the rare and carefully selected Loan Collection,” the Committee’s goals were to ensure the funding of the pedestal was an endeavor “not one community alone, but the entire nation, should feel an interest,” as well as “awakening among us a potent influence in art.”

Fundraising ebbed once again in 1885, when it was determined that another $100,000 would be needed to complete the pedestal. At that point, Joseph Pulitzer, the editor of the newspaper The New York World, took up the cause. Soliciting donations from everyone from schoolchildren to the richest captains of industry, Pulitzer was able to help harness the excitement of the statue’s arrival from France. It arrived at its permanent home of Bedloe’s Island on June 19, awaiting only the pedestal’s completion.",https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/joi0126_lead.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 09:13:44.124222

Health care employment also continued its upward trend in December, rising by 21,000 jobs, including a gain of 16,000 in hospitals.","The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 50,000 in December 2025, missing the 73,000 Dow Jones estimate and slowing from November’s revised gain of 56,000. November payrolls were revised down by 8,000 jobs, while October’s loss deepened to 173,000 from 105,000. For 2025 as a whole, payrolls grew by an average of 49,000 jobs per month, down sharply from 168,000 in 2024.

Bank of America Global Research analysts wrote in a report on Friday that although payroll growth has slowed since June, the unemployment rate has risen by only about 11 basis points. The report noted, “We have been highlighting that tighter immigration restrictions are likely to play a bigger role in the slowdown in job growth this year.”

The unemployment rate is a key statistic for the Fed, and markets responded to Friday’s miss by pricing out a January rate cut, according to the analysts. Futures now imply less than half a cut priced in through April, which marks the end of Powell’s term.

The productivity factor

Despite weak job growth, forecasts still point to solid overall economic expansion. I asked Gregory Daco, EY chief economist, how the U.S. economy can continue to grow strongly while hiring softens.

“We’re seeing a clear decoupling between growth and hiring,” Daco said. Output is still expanding, but companies are generating that growth with fewer incremental workers and fewer hours.

“Productivity has rebounded meaningfully as businesses continue to streamline operations, automate processes, and extract more output from existing teams in a high-cost, high-interest-rate environment,” Daco explained. “This isn’t AI-led in a narrow sense yet—it’s the payoff from multi-year efficiency drives, tighter cost discipline, and delayed hiring.”

According to the BLS, nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 4.9% in the third quarter of 2025, as output rose 5.4% while hours worked increased just 0.5%.

Areas of job growth

Where job growth has occurred, employment in food services and drinking places continued to trend higher in December, adding 27,000 jobs. The sector added an average of 12,000 jobs per month in 2025, roughly in line with the 11,000 average monthly gain in 2024.

Health care employment also continued its upward trend in December, rising by 21,000 jobs, including a gain of 16,000 in hospitals. Health care added an average of 34,000 jobs per month in 2025, down from an average monthly increase of 56,000 in 2024.

Monster’s newly released 2026 Job Market Outlook also reflects these pockets of strength. Based on full-year 2025 job posting and job seeker data, the report shows employer demand remaining firm in health care, essential services, infrastructure-related roles, and skill-based jobs, even as other parts of the labor market slow.

‘Hiring hasn’t stopped’

As private payroll growth weakened throughout 2025 and hiring appetites diminished, I asked Daco whether he expects that trend to continue amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and tariff-related risks

“Yes—barring a material improvement in policy clarity, I expect hiring restraint to persist,” he said. Private payroll growth has already slowed sharply as firms shift into cost-control mode, with geopolitical risks, tariff uncertainty, and elevated financing costs reinforcing that bias, he explained.

“Hiring hasn’t stopped, but it has become more selective and more conditional on clear demand visibility,” Daco added. “In this environment, CFOs are likely to continue favoring efficiency, automation, and capex discipline over broad-based workforce expansion.”

The latest S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows that large U.S. corporate bankruptcies rose to one of the highest monthly totals in five years in December 2025, with filings increasing to 72 from 63 in November. This uptick extended the 15-year high for annual filings first set in November, bringing the total to 785 for the year—the highest since 2010. Rising interest rates have been a significant factor, as many companies struggled to refinance their debt, according to the report.

The data covers companies with public debt and at least $2 million in assets or liabilities, as well as private companies with at least $10 million in assets or liabilities at the time of filing.

Picking the right S&P 500 stocks requires more than just buying big names, and that’s where StockStory comes in. That said, here is one S&P 500 stock that is leading the market forward and two that may struggle.

Two Stocks to Sell:

Kraft Heinz (KHC)

Market Cap: $27.72 billion

The result of a 2015 mega-merger between Kraft and Heinz, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is a packaged foods giant whose products span coffee to cheese to packaged meat.

Why Do We Avoid KHC?

Declining unit sales over the past two years show it’s struggled to move its products and had to rely on price increases

Efficiency has decreased over the last year as its operating margin fell by 34.6 percentage points

ROIC of 1.2% reflects management’s challenges in identifying attractive investment opportunities, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging

Kraft Heinz’s stock price of $23.44 implies a valuation ratio of 9.5x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why KHC doesn’t pass our bar.

Keysight (KEYS)

Market Cap: $35.62 billion

Spun off from Hewlett-Packard in 2014, Keysight (NYSE:KEYS) offers electronic measurement products for use in various sectors.

Why Does KEYS Give Us Pause?

New orders were hard to come by as its average backlog growth of 1.1% over the past two years underwhelmed

Earnings per share fell by 7.3% annually over the last two years while its revenue was flat, showing each sale was less profitable

Shrinking returns on capital suggest that increasing competition is eating into the company’s profitability

Keysight is trading at $207.32 per share, or 25.6x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with KEYS, check out our full research report (it’s free).

One Stock to Buy:

ID21,IBM,2026-01-12 12:13:32+00:00,www.theregister.com,How CP/M-86's delay handed Microsoft the keys to the kingdom - The Register,Liam Proven,,,,,https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/why_cpm86_was_late/,"The real reason is the delay in delivering CP/M-86, and that's what Trifunovic covers in detail.
You couldn't run the 8080 version of CP/M (soon renamed CP/M-80) on it, like you could with a Z80.
86-DOS had been created by SCP as a stand-in for CP/M-86 and was thus intentionally compatible with the DR OS.
It had already effectively merged its multiuser multitasking MP/M [PDF] OS into CP/M-86 to create the multitasking Concurrent CP/M.
By 1984, Concurrent CP/M became Concurrent DOS, a true multitasking OS that could run MS-DOS apps.","A blog post by programmer Nemanja Trifunovic, The Late Arrival of 16-bit CP/M, is on the face of it an interesting little excursion into the late delivery of a long-forgotten bit of software – one that turned out to be pivotal for the entire computer industry.

It's the story of why the 16-bit version of Digital Research CP/M was late, but the delayed arrival of this now-obscure OS is what catalyzed the development of a different, but source-level compatible, OS. That OS started Microsoft on its way to its current $3.5 trillion capitalization, and is also what led to the development of OS/2, Windows, and indirectly Linux. There's a good chance that you already think you know how what happened, but if you reckon it's anything to do with DR's Gary Kildall being out flying a plane, that's not the true story, as The Register covered in 2011 (we'll get back to why not later in this piece). The real reason is the delay in delivering CP/M-86, and that's what Trifunovic covers in detail.

The CP/M-86 User Guide [PDF] bears a copyright year of 1981. The problem is it was designed for Intel's 8086 processor, and that shipped in 1978 – followed a year later by the budget model, the cut-down Intel 8088. In other words, the new edition of CP-M arrived about three years late. Its target, the 8086, was the exciting new 16-bit successor to the Intel 8080. As Intel's own page says:

It didn't revolutionize microprocessors – it created the microprocessor market.

This is no exaggeration, and a big reason it did so well was that it had a de facto standard OS: Digital Research's CP/M. CP/M was completely dominant. The early business microcomputer industry ran on it and essentially nothing else.

There was another processor that ran CP/M: Zilog's Z80. Although a fine chip and still mourned today, the Z80 was very much an eight-bit device, limited to a total of 64 KB of memory (RAM and ROM put together) without complicated bank switching.

As memory grew more affordable, what businesses needed was a partly compatible successor to the 8080 that could handle more of it. Intel delivered that with the 8086, which, rather than being limited to 64 KB, could handle 16 separate segments of 64 KB – for a total of one whole megabyte of memory space.

The problem was that, unlike the Z80, the 8086 was not binary compatible with the 8080. You couldn't run the 8080 version of CP/M (soon renamed CP/M-80) on it, like you could with a Z80. To use the new chip, hundreds of thousands of CP/M users needed a new OS. DR originally promised it would deliver one by November 1979, but it didn't happen. Trifunovic's article explains why and how it slipped.

As a result, one of the hardware OEMs selling 8086 boards was more or less forced to develop its own independent, third-party-compatible OS. No, not Microsoft, and not IBM either. Back in 2007, Tim Paterson, the developer of that OS, wrote about how and why he did it. He called the result 86-DOS, and a couple of years ago, we covered the rediscovery of the oldest known version of that OS.

Paterson started work on 86-DOS in 1980 because CP/M-86 was already late. That was more than a year before IBM launched the first IBM PC – with the budget cut-down 8088, so it cost ""only"" $1,500.

As The Register put it back in 2011:

In fact, it's likely IBM selected CP/M-86 but was forced to look, at least temporarily, elsewhere as DR's effort to port CP/M to the Intel 8086/8088 CPU was taking longer than planned. Gates may well have pitched an alternative – IBM was already talking to Microsoft about using the latter's implementation of the Basic programming language – and appears to have won the deal in November 1980.

Not long after, Microsoft licensed 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products (SCP), specifically to sub-license the OS to IBM in turn. 86-DOS had been created by SCP as a stand-in for CP/M-86 and was thus intentionally compatible with the DR OS.

In time, that made the fortune of Microsoft. Because IBM didn't get Microsoft to sign an exclusive deal, Microsoft was allowed to sell its DOS to whoever it wanted. That, together with cheaper IBM-compatible hardware, created the x86 PC industry.

The limitations of DOS, especially its memory management, are why Intel's successor chip, the 80286, was a bit of a flop. Although the 80286 had protected mode, which allowed it to support 16 MB of RAM and multitasking, this did little to help DOS — or IBM's new OS/2 1.0.

Here, too, DR missed out again. It had lost the deal to be the default OS on IBM's PC, but when Intel was developing the 80286, DR was ready for it.

It had already effectively merged its multiuser multitasking MP/M [PDF] OS into CP/M-86 to create the multitasking Concurrent CP/M. It then added MS-DOS compatibility to create Concurrent DOS. The problem was that you can't fit many DOS apps into the 640 KB of RAM in an 8088 or 8086 PC.

So DR enhanced Concurrent DOS to make a native Intel 80286 OS. Concurrent DOS 286 was able to use up to 16 MB of RAM, and multitask lots of DOS apps in all that room (IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 1.0 wouldn't follow for over two more years, and still couldn't multitask DOS apps when it did).

The issue was that DR developed Concurrent DOS 286 on pre-release Intel 286 prototypes. Although the 80286 was released in 1982, it reached the PC market with IBM's new PC/AT in 1984. The problem was that the shipping version of the 80286 chip removed some features Concurrent DOS 286 needed.

By 1985, Intel released a new stepping of the 80286, which replaced the missing features, but the damage was done. Once again, this seriously damaged DR, but it recovered. It turned CDOS into a real-time OS, FlexOS 286. Versions of this remained on sale well into the 21st century, including IBM 4690 OS [PDF], Toshiba 4690 OS [PDF], and Siemens S5-DOS/MT [PDF].

DR also continued to work on its pre-Windows GUI desktop GEM (in its early days, The Reg covered the news of GEM going FOSS). Late last year, Mr Trifunovic also published an excellent History of the GEM Desktop Environment, which we also recommend. Later versions of DR FlexOS and its derivatives included a multitasking version of GEM called X/GEM [PDF].

DR worked around the limitations of the 80286, and found ways to put them to good use. Microsoft, for the most part, did not. Even Windows/286 couldn't use most of the memory of an 80286 PC, as we looked at last year.

As a result of the limitations of Microsoft's DOS, the 80286 was mainly just used as a faster 8086. This drove Intel to develop its following generation of CPU, the 80386. This supported multiple hardware-assisted DOS VMs with memory protection – and even if you just ran plain old single-tasking DOS, that memory protection let you rearrange that crucial first megabyte of RAM to free as much as possible of the 640 KB which was all DOS could directly use.

Without widespread use of multitasking, let alone GUIs, on late-1980s PCs, the original all-32-bit 80386DX was too expensive – even without its theoretical 4 GB memory capacity. So, once again, it was the limitations of MS-DOS that drove Intel to develop the cheaper 16-bit-bus 80386SX. This created a market for cheap 386SX PCs with cheap 16-bit RAM and a low ceiling of just 16 MB.

That market of cheap commodity 386 PCs is the soil in which Linux grew and flourished. Early 1990s 386 PCs were not workstation-class hardware. They were never expected to multitask, and they didn't run GUIs very well, but they ran DOS just great... and even their low specs allowed Linux to thrive.

Dispelling some myths about how DR lost the IBM deal

Yes, Gary Kildall was in his plane when IBM visited. No, he wasn't on a pleasure trip. He was flying to make a site visit with a very important business partner, Bill Godbout, for whom The Reg ran an obituary in 2018. Along on the trip was his colleague Tom Rolander, who has told this story repeatedly, including on video (from 17 minutes onward). Rolander has also told the story to industry commentator Robert Scoble (Scoble's interview can be found on the Wayback Machine).

Microsoft open-sources the 6502 BASIC coded by Bill Gates himself

50 years ago, Gates and Allen made the deal that launched Microsoft

FreeDOS 1.4: Still DOS, still FOSS, more modern than ever

How a good business deal made us underestimate BASIC

DR was based in Pacific Grove, some 80 miles or nearly a 90-minute drive from Silicon Valley. Kildall often chose to fly. If you had that option, wouldn't you?

Kildall wasn't at the meeting with IBM because it was not his job – he was a programmer. His wife and business partner, Dorothy McEwen Kildall, co-founded DR and she handled corporate negotiations.

IBM wanted a harsh NDA and a one-off payment. She refused, which was a sensible call; DR dominated business computing, and IBM wasn't even in that market.

In other words, IBM tried to drive a tough deal with the big player that dominated the sector. It didn't work, so it negotiated poorly with a bunch of upstart kids: it let Microsoft keep a licence to resell DOS to other vendors. Two poor deals in a row show that it wasn't IBM being canny; it was merely IBM being bureaucratic and institutional, poor at negotiation and compromise. It handed Microsoft the keys to the bank, and the tiny startup used them.

We've even seen a perception that what the industry got from Microsoft was better: more capable and more open.

In fact, it was DR, consigned to second place, that worked harder. It delivered a small, fast, clean GUI with GEM. Abort Retry Fail has a good Short History of CP/M-86, which shows how DR delivered and continued to deliver. It had a multitasking CP/M-86 by 1982.

By 1984, Concurrent CP/M became Concurrent DOS, a true multitasking OS that could run MS-DOS apps. In 1985, DR released the C rewrite, Concurrent DOS 286, two years before IBM and Microsoft's combined effort. By 1987, when OS/2 staggered out, DR was offering Concurrent DOS 386, with built-in networking as well.

The Reg FOSS desk used and supported Concurrent DOS 386 in his first job, and it was remarkable. On his employer's demo machines, he used CDOS to generate large Mandelbrot sets, which took many hours, using Fractint – but with Fractint running in the background, and CDOS 386 running a copy of COMMAND.COM from IBM PC DOS 3.3 in the foreground session, so it looked exactly like a standard DOS computer and could be used as normal.

Without a time machine, we can't tell what DR would have done if it had delivered CP/M-86 on time. Perhaps it worked so hard on GEM, Concurrent DOS, DR-DOS, FlexOS, and so on because it ended up the also-ran. It worked very hard to rectify its mistakes, and if the PC industry had defaulted to DR OSes rather than Microsoft ones, it might have advanced rather faster. DR could have offered a multitasking 32-bit GUI OS with networking, able to run DOS apps, nearly a decade before Windows 95.

But it didn't. Squeezed out of the mainstream desktop OS market, it focused on multiuser, real-time, and point-of-sale systems instead. In the end, Novell acquired DR in 1991.

All because CP/M-86 was late. Trifunovic explains why and how that happened. That's vital info: it shaped the future of the PC industry, and trillion-dollar businesses hinged upon it. As wise people have noted, it's important to know your history.

With the phasing out of Section 25D at the end of 2025, the US residential solar sector must once again adapt to dramatic shifts to the tax credit landscape, a phenomenon known as the ""solar-coaster.""

In this episode of the “Energy Evolution” podcast, host Dan Testa discussed the implications of these changes with S&P Global Energy renewable energy reporter Kirsten Errick. Cinthya Peña, a renewables market analyst at S&P Global Energy Horizons, and Maheep Mandloi, director of clean energy equity research at Mizuho Americas, also shed light on how this tax credit cliff could alter the market.

Copper in the Age of AI: Challenges of Electrification

This comprehensive S&P Global study identifies a transformative trajectory for copper demand. Global demand is projected to rise 50% to 42 million metric tons by 2040, from 28 million metric tons in 2025, underscoring the metal's pivotal role in multiple technological and economic domains. However, there are significant obstacles in meeting these needs. The study projects a potential shortfall of 10 million metric tons by 2040 without meaningful supply expansion.

Copper is essential for the generation, transmission and use of electricity. However, the demand for copper will outrun supply unless there is a major adjustment across the copper supply system.

Private Credit Outlook 2026

Private credit enters 2026 facing its most challenging environment since the 2008 financial crisis. Global economic uncertainty around trade, investor jitters over runaway spending on AI and damaging headlines tied to late-cycle excesses in broader credit markets mean fund managers and allocators must tread carefully.

Cracks are emerging in corporate credit. A series of high-profile leveraged loan defaults in late 2025 and the rising use of payment-in-kind toggles in direct lending point to mounting stress. A new cohort of distressed and opportunistic credit funds, which have raised more than $100 billion over the past two years, is poised to capitalize on any resulting volatility.

Private credit is changing rapidly. The market of 2030 will look materially different from that of 2020. After years of allocating predominantly to US direct lending, allocators are broadening their horizons by geography and sub-strategy. The surge in European fundraising in 2025 is unlikely to be short-lived as allocators increasingly turn to the region for diversification and alpha.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/Corp_0606_DailyUpdateSustainability?$responsive$,N,,2026-01-12 08:15:17.187118

Morgan Stanley's Downgrade Impact

This Monday, Morgan Stanley downgraded Capgemini from market-weight to underweight and reduced its price target from EUR 145 to EUR 142, citing concerns about the company's organic growth trajectory, particularly after the acquisition of WNS in the fourth quarter of 2025. The American bank highlights that the organic growth expectations for 2026 have been reduced to 2.5% from 4.5% a year ago. Analysts believe there is no path to further expansion of valuation multiples. This recommendation comes as the stock was trading close to its major technical resistance at EUR 151.85 the day before, after having increased by nearly 3% over a week and more than 21% over three months. Morgan Stanley notes that Capgemini's decision to stop directly publishing organic growth in 2025 will make it more difficult to analyze trends of acceleration or sequential slowdown. The stock is now trading at EUR 144.90, below its 20-day moving average of EUR 145.57, but remains above the 50-day (EUR 138.18) and 200-day (EUR 134.82) moving averages. The RSI at 57 indicates a neutral situation, dismissing any oversold signal despite the day's correction.

Monday's Decline Erases Recent Gains

Monday's decline wipes out some of the gains recorded since the beginning of the year. The stock had risen 2.31% on January 9th, closing at EUR 150.85 and flirting with the resistance at EUR 151.85. The 3.94% drop brings the price close to its 20-day moving average, a first technical support to watch. The MACD, with a line at 2.29 slightly above its signal line at 2.26, displays a positive but thin histogram (0.03), suggesting a weakening of the bullish momentum. The upper Bollinger band, located at EUR 151.78, is no longer immediately reachable, while the lower band at EUR 139.36 provides a safety cushion of nearly 4% below the current prices. Fundamentally, investors remain on hold before the release of the annual 2025 results scheduled for February 13th, a crucial appointment after the revised growth targets announced in November. The group had then raised its growth forecast at constant exchange rates between 2% and 2.5%, driven by demand in cloud and artificial intelligence. J.P. Morgan maintains a neutral recommendation with a target at EUR 155, while Grupo Santander keeps an outperform rating. The share of capital traded this Monday stands at 0.06%, a very moderate level reflecting a selective investor reaction to Morgan Stanley's note.

Excelsior Rotterdam had little to contribute against the high tempo and attacking intentions of PSV. After ninety minutes there was a convincing victory on the scoreboard, good for the first three points of the year. It is the sixth time in the club's history and the second time under Peter Bosz that PSV has won sixteen of its first eighteen league games.

Five names on the scoreboard

Paul Wanner opened the scoring within ten minutes. It marked his first goal in the VriendenLoterij Eredivisie and his second of the season, following his goal in the cup game with GVVV. Dennis Man laid the ball ready for the German after a strong individual action, notching his sixth assist this season. Ricardo Pepi doubled the margin and wrote history again. The striker became the third American player to score in the Eredivisie in five games in a row, Earnest Stewart and Michael Bradley having gone before him. Guus Til cleverly played Pepi free and provided his fifth assist of the season, three of them in the league.

Yarek Gąsiorowski also asserted himself with his third goal of the season. Mauro Júnior found the defender's head perfectly and notched his eighth assist. The fourth goal came courtesy of Ryan Flamingo, who was back in the starting lineup in league play. The last time the central defender did so was in September, also against Excelsior. Ryan scored his second goal of the season off a Joey Veerman cross, which marked his ninth assist. The final chord was for Dennis Man. The Romanian crowned a strong game with his fourth goal of the season, his third in the Eredivisie, and was rightly named Star of the Match thanks to his goal and assist.

High and low point

For Nicolas Verkooijen the game was extra special. The young Belgian made his official debut in the VriendenLoterij Eredivisie, having previously made minutes in the cup game with GVVV.

In contrast, the low point of the evening was the injury to Ricardo Pepi. The striker had to leave the field within half an hour after breaking his forearm at his goal. Pepi has since undergone successful surgery and is expected to be sidelined for about two months.

The jump comes after French publication La Lettre reported that Eli Lilly was prepared to pay €15 billion to buy Abivax, nearly double its current market capitalisation.

The report said no formal offer has yet been submitted to Abivax’s board, but that Eli Lilly is still in the race and is awaiting guidance from the French Finance Ministry on whether a potential deal would be subject to foreign investment controls.

While attending the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Abivax’s chief executive Marc de Garidel told Bloomberg News that big pharma could no longer overlook the company’s lead drug candidate, obefazimod, which he said may become “one of the most-used products in the next decade.”

The experimental oral drug is being developed to treat ulcerative colitis.

“We are concentrating on developing this drug, bring it to the market. That’s all that matters. The rumours, speculations, we have no control over those,’ Garidel told BiotechTV in a separate interview.

Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Justine Telliez said Abivax has emerged as “one of the most attractive late-stage M&A targets”in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) following positive phase III induction data in ulcerative colitis.

In an acquisition, valuation would typically move above standalone levels as buyers apply a broader “control” lens, embedding a control premium and assigning incremental value to factors excluded from the base case, including execution synergies, lifecycle management and pipeline optionality, Telliez wrote.

UCP’s launch comes less than 14 weeks after OpenAI and Stripe announced their Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) – and directly brings on board a retailer (Shopify) that OpenAI had promised to onboard to its systems.

Like ACP, Google’s new standard can be implemented via REST APIs or MCP (Model Context Protocol). It can also be implemented via the A2A protocol.

At the National Retail Federation on January 11, Pichai said: “The industry needs a protocol that works at global scale and takes into account the nuances of commerce journeys, and this is a critical building block for it.”

What is the UCP standard?

The protocol facilitates interactions between agents or AI platforms acting on behalf of users, businesses selling goods and services, credential providers such as Google Wallet, and payment service providers (PSPs) like PayPal and Stripe, via a range of modular capabilities and standards

At launch, UCP supports checkout, identity linking and order management capabilities, building on existing standards including OAuth 2.0 and PCI-DSS, and with support for inter-agent protocols MCP and Google’s own A2A built-in.

A roadmap shared by Google says future capabilities will cover product discovery, support for multi-item checkout, loyalty benefits, and post-order management.

A phased rollout will see UCP first support payments in markets including India, Indonesia and Latin America. ""We are adapting the protocol to support broader regional use cases and localized payment interoperability,"" said Google.

A new agentic battleground

Commerce is proving to be a new battleground for agentic standards, with UCP Google’s second standard in the sector after it launched the Agent Payments Protocol (APP) to support financial transactions made by agents in 2025.

While APP was designed for payments companies, UCP appears to be a direct competitor to OpenAI’s ACP, launched in September 2025 with the support of fintech Stripe.

The world's two largest payment companies, Visa and Mastercard are also looking to power agentic commerce, launching their Intelligent Commerce and AgentPay platforms in summer 2025 to manage agent-led payments on their networks.

Writing late last year, analysts at London firm TTL LLP noted of agentic commerce and AI shopping that “the commercial implications are enormous. If AI agents become the primary gateway to shopping: Consumers may bypass traditional e-commerce websites altogether. Search volumes on platforms like Google could fall dramatically… New revenue models are emerging.

Philanthropy is evolving. It is becoming more strategic, more impactful, and more deeply personal. At Barclays Private Bank, we recently brought together philanthropists, charity leaders, and advisers to launch The Modern Philanthropist, a report based on specialist research into the motivations and behaviours of high-net-worth (HNW) donors. The event, held in London, provided a unique opportunity to explore the evolving nature of giving and the possibilities it creates for those who want to make a difference.

Understanding the motivations behind giving

Kicking off the event, Isabelle Hayhoe, Senior Philanthropy Adviser at Barclays Private Bank, explained that despite the significant – and growing – contributions of HNW philanthropists in the UK, there is still little clarity around what truly drives their generosity. To address this gap, Barclays commissioned research to uncover the motivations and behaviours shaping this vital form of giving. The result is The Modern Philanthropist, a report offering insights into how donors think, what prompts them to act, and how their approach is changing.

Cath Dovey CBE, Philanthropy Partner at New Philanthropy Capital and co-founder of the Beacon Collaborative, started the presentation by sharing a compelling picture of growth. In 2024, UK HNW individuals (HNWIs) donated an estimated £11.3 billion, with the median annual donation more than doubling since 2019 – rising from £5,500 to £12,000 in 2025 . Giving has outpaced both inflation and key market indices , suggesting real-terms growth driven by changing priorities rather than simply rising wealth.

Together, Cath Dovey and Isabelle Hayhoe explored what these trends mean for donors and charities alike. Their message was clear: philanthropy is becoming more intentional, and charities have a growing opportunity to engage high-net-worth individuals as partners in change through deeper understanding of the points of alignment in their goals, mission and motivation.

What the research reveals: Shifts in modern philanthropy

The report uncovered several themes shaping modern philanthropy. Firstly, wealth thresholds and liquidity events remain powerful triggers for major giving. While reaching £1–2 million in investible wealth is often the point at which donors start to make significant gifts, more than half have given sizeable amounts before hitting that milestone, often prompted by inheritance, business sales, or property profits. These findings highlight that the decision to give is highly individual, shaped by both a sense of financial security and key life events that provide donors with the means and motivation to act on their philanthropic intentions.

Giving is becoming more strategic. Donors now support an average of four causes, up from three in 2019, and many are formalising their approach: around one in three has set up a charitable trust, included giving in estate plans, or engaged a philanthropy adviser, while one in four has established a donor-advised fund. Yet knowledge gaps persist - a third of donors feel unclear about how charities operate, and many are deterred by the complexity of giving structures.

Impact all-round matters too. Two-thirds of HNWIs want their investments to generate positive social or environmental change alongside financial returns - a clear signal that philanthropy and impact investing are increasingly intertwined.

From insight to action: Why advice matters

Following a deep dive into report headlines, a panel of sector leaders joined Isabelle Hayhoe for a lively and insightful Q&A session. Fozia Irfan OBE (BBC Children in Need), Rory Brooks CBE (philanthropist and Charity Commission board member), Liam Eaglestone (Steve Morgan Foundation), and Roland Pearce (Barclays Corporate Bank) shared their perspectives on the opportunities and challenges facing philanthropy today.

Philanthropy is deeply personal, yet for many donors, the process can feel daunting. Questions about where to give, how to measure impact, and how to align charitable goals with broader financial plans often create uncertainty. In these moments, trusted advice becomes invaluable.

As Rory Brooks CBE observed, “Donors often feel isolated. They believe others understand complex giving, but they don’t.” That sense of isolation is common – and it’s why open dialogue matters. Conversations with a philanthropic adviser can turn complexity into clarity. They help donors articulate intent, explore values, and design strategies that align giving with tax, estate planning, and investment objectives.

The research reinforces this point. Giving structures – such as charitable trusts, donor-advised funds, and impact investing – can help donors maximise the impact and effectiveness of their philanthropy when used appropriately. While 49% of donors give cash donations, many use two or more vehicles: 36% have a charitable trust, 26% a donor-advised fund, and 20% are part of a giving circle. These approaches aren’t right for everyone, and understanding remains low, but when used well, they can unlock greater impact for both donors and charities

The message is clear: philanthropy works best when it’s informed, intentional, and supported by expertise. Trusted advice doesn’t just simplify decisions – it amplifies the difference giving can make.

Beyond capital: The value of expertise

Philanthropy is not only about financial capital. It is about what donors bring beyond money - their knowledge, networks, and experience. Liam Eaglestone described how the Steve Morgan Foundation uses business expertise to help charities build resilience and capacity. “Charities need both funds and professional experience,” he explained. “Donors can offer so much more than money.”

Roland Pearce echoed this point, highlighting the importance of infrastructure – data, technology, and systems that enable charities to measure and communicate impact effectively. “Good data is essential for understanding and improving outcomes,” he said. Without it, charities can struggle to demonstrate the difference they make, which in turn affects donor confidence.

The takeaway? When donors share their skills thoughtfully alongside their financial resources, they can help charities become stronger, more sustainable, and better equipped to deliver lasting impact.

Philanthropy as a human endeavour

For Fozia Irfan OBE, philanthropy is ultimately about people. “Philanthropy is not an act of doing but a state of being. When people give, it is an act of love.” She spoke about the power of storytelling and the importance of seeing the individuals behind the causes. Today’s donors - particularly younger generations - are more vocal, sophisticated, and focused on impact than ever before.

As Isabelle Hayhoe reflected, “Good fundraising is about the donor saying they are excited – how can I help? It should be about alignment, not persuasion.” That sense of synergy, between donor intent and charitable purpose, is what creates meaningful, lasting change.

Looking forward: Collaboration and lasting impact

The event closed with a call for greater collaboration and innovation. Both donors and charities must remain alert to risks such as mission creep, where organisations adapt too far to donor priorities. The consensus was clear: partnership between donors, advisers, and charities has never been more important.

As Cath Dovey summed up, “Philanthropy is a learning journey. There are many approaches, and donors are becoming more confident and knowledgeable.”

Economic growth update

HM Treasury responds to House of Lords Financial Services Regulation Committee criticisms

On 17 December 2025, the House of Lords Financial Services Regulation Committee (Committee) published a letter from HM Treasury (HMT).

The letter responds to criticisms made by the Committee in October 2025 regarding the government's engagement with the Committee's second report on the FCA and PRA secondary objective of facilitating the UK economy's growth and international competitiveness, which we covered in our November 2025 update.

In its letter, HMT provides additional information on the key issues highlighted by the Committee.

Facilitating economic growth. The response sets out the details of the evidence-based approach used by HMT and the regulators to support economic growth and steps being taken by the government to build the evidence base. These include a ""frank and comprehensive"" assessment of the sector's past performance and the development of a bespoke methodology to produce financial services clusters to help focus future policy to ensure it supports the wider economy. The response also outlines what the government is doing to support SME financing and proposals to require regulators to take account of the government's remit letter when determining long-term strategies.

Growth metrics. The government does not intend to undertake a further review of the FCA and PRA growth metrics.

Performance metrics. The government believes the right balance has been struck in the new timelines for regulators to determine authorisation applications and will bring forward legislation to change the statutory deadlines when parliamentary time allows.

International comparisons. The government acknowledges that international comparison on the cost of regulation would be beneficial but highlights some of the difficulties in making such comparisons (including the absence of collected data on the costs of regulation across jurisdictions and the lack of accepted uniform metrics for measuring regulatory performance) and that there are other factors that influence UK competitiveness aside from regulatory costs including strengthening trade, investment and partnerships ""between nations with shared interests.""

The letter concludes by noting that HMT will give a further progress update in summer 2026.

FCA and PRA update to government on economic growth work

On 9 December 2025, the FCA and PRA published letters sent to the government providing an update on their respective work to support the government's UK economic growth objective.

The FCA provided an overview of its work during 2025 and highlights plans to support growth in 2026, including:

Unlocking capital investment and liquidity. The FCA intends to reform rules for venture capital and alternative investment fund managers and consult on the pension charge cap so consumers are not disincentivised from investments due to higher performance fees.

Accelerating digital innovation to enhance productivity. The FCA intends to oversee the launch of variable recurring payments to give people more control of regular payments and drive competition, finalise digital assets rules and progress UK-issued sterling stablecoins, and set the delivery plan for open finance, prioritising SME lending.

Reducing regulatory burden. The FCA intends to further overhaul mortgage rules to enable more people to get on the housing ladder and unlock housing wealth in later life and finalise reforms to the redress system including providing clarity on fair motor finance compensation.

Making it easier for firms to start up and grow. The FCA intends to propose removal of the seven-day research waiting period to reduce delays in IPO application and prepare to allow some early-stage firms to conduct regulated business before full authorisation upon the passing of legislation.

Improving exports and inward investment. The FCA intends to establish a presence in Singapore and deepen integration with the USA. Our December 2025 update discusses the initial announcement of the FCA to establish a presence in Singapore through a strategic partnership with the AI Monetary Authority of Singapore.

The FCA also intends to adapt its supervisory approach, with more tailoring to firms' size and type, and prioritise enforcement of the most egregious harms. It calls for the government to provide clearer articulation of its risk appetite to assist with the implementation of its innovation and growth plans.

FSB report on non-bank financial intermediation

On 16 December 2025, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its annual Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2025.

The report, which includes the annual FSB monitoring exercise, describes broad trends in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) across 29 jurisdictions that account for over 90% of global GDP.

The main findings include:

In 2024, the NBFI sector grew 9.4%, double the pace of the banking sector (4.7%), increasing its share of total global financial assets to 51% (US$256.8 trillion).

All NBFI subsectors grew in 2024. The sector 'other financial intermediaries' (money market funds, hedge funds, other investment funds, trust companies, and structured finance vehicles) was the fastest growing sub-sector, growing by 11% over the year, to US$169.4 trillion.

Pension fund and insurance corporation assets grew 7% and 6%, respectively.

The narrow measure of the NBFI sector, consisting of entities involved in credit intermediation activities that may pose bank-like financial stability risks, increased 12% to US$76.3 trillion.

Most vulnerability metrics for entities within the narrow measure of the NBFI remained broadly stable. Fixed income and mixed funds showed high degrees of liquidity transformation, while finance companies, broker-dealers, and structured finance vehicles displayed high levels of leverage.

ESMA publishes market report on crowdfunding in the EU 2025

On 22 December 2025, ESMA published its market report on crowdfunding within the EU, which provides an overview of the state of the EU crowdfunding market, based on data received from national competent authorities under the EU Crowdfunding Regulation.

By the end of 2024, across the EU, 181 crowdfunding service providers raised over EUR4 billion of crowdfunding, with 21 Member States hosting at least one active provider. Loan-based projects were most prevalent, making up over half (58%) of crowdfunding in 2024, followed by debt-based projects at 23% and equity-based amounting to 12%. Debt-based crowdfunding differs from loan-based crowdfunding in that it involves transferable securities.

Similar to the previous report, the majority of crowdfunding investors focused on the retail industry, with 88% being classified as retail investors during 2024.

The top five countries in terms of capital raised were France (EUR1.45 billion), the Netherlands (EUR 1 billion), Spain (EUR0.45 billion), Italy (EUR0.29 billion) and Lithuania (EUR0.28 billion). Among the top five countries, France was the only country to have predominantly debt-based crowdfunding, amounting to 50% of funding raised, with loan-based crowdfunding amounting to 23% of funding raised. In contrast, loan-based crowdfunding was the most common type in the Netherlands (81%), Spain (60%), Italy (50%) and Lithuania (96%).

FCA launches review of bespoke market risk rules for non-banks

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published an engagement paper on the possible introduction of bespoke market risk rules for non-bank trading firms.

The primary focus will be a review of the current requirements in sections 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 of the Prudential sourcebook for MiFID Investment Firms (MIFIDPRU) and the corresponding sections of the UK Capital Requirements Regulation (UK CRR).

Chapter 3 identifies a range of possible approaches to setting capital requirements for market risk. The FCA is seeking stakeholder engagement, to narrow the options for more detailed consideration. The possible approaches presented are:

Amend the existing standardised approach. Amend the current K-NPR calculation (a capital requirement based on net position risk) and incorporate requirements within the FCA Handbook, or allow firms to scale down K-NPR calculations via a simple discount factor.

A margin-based approach. Extend the current K-CMG approach (based on the third highest daily total margin over three months) to uncleared over-the-counter derivatives using historic margins or apply it to cash products using derived margins from futures contracts.

An internally modelled approach. Amend the current internal model approach to make it more proportionate and risk-sensitive or use other risk management techniques such as variance-covariance matrices, Monte Carlo simulations, or scenario analyses to set regulatory capital.

A net capital rule (NCR) approach. Adopt an NCR approach based on firms maintaining specified minimum levels of net liquid assets.

Repurposing K-TCD for exposure to price risk. Investment firms that deal in their own name may also have to calculate a separate capital requirement to protect against the default of a trading counterparty (K-TCD). This includes the firm having to calculate a transaction’s exposure value to capture the replacement cost of an asset or contract and, for a derivative, its potential future exposure. These basic concepts could be repurposed to capture risk currently addressed by K-NPR. Replacement cost and potential future exposure can reflect current market risk of a given position.

A weighted liquid exposure method. Develop a methodology where firms assess the time required to close an exposure without moving market prices, with capital charges applied to the overall weighted liquidity profile.

The FCA intends to conduct a roundtable in January 2026 prior to the deadline for responses on 10 February 2026. It aims to publish a consultation paper later in 2026 and a policy statement in 2027.

FCA policy statement on tackling non-financial misconduct in financial services

On 12 December 2025, the FCA published a policy statement, amending its guidance in the Code of Conduct (COCON) to explain in what circumstances non-financial misconduct (NFM) could amount to a breach of the conduct rules. The policy statement also amends the guidance in the Fit and Proper test for Employees and Senior Personnel sourcebook (FIT) to explain how NFM forms part of FIT.

The amendments are intended to make it easier for firms within the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, to consistently interpret and apply the rules and follows the introduction of a new rule in COCON in July 2025, which amends the scope of COCON as it applies to non-banks (see our July 2025 update). Updates to the guidance include:

New examples and flow diagrams within the Handbook are intended to help firms apply COCON consistently, in particular, the rules in COCON 1. A decision tree is included to help firms decide if NFM amounts to a rule breach.

The guidance has been revised, where possible, to further align with relevant provisions in employment and equality law. This includes an example suggested by a respondent to demonstrate that the purpose of the conduct is as important as its effect. This shows how an individual can breach COCON even if their hostile and intimidatory communication is intercepted before it reaches the intended subject.

Clarification that managers’ accountability is relative to their knowledge and authority. The amended guidance will make it clearer that the FCA would not expect a manager to be held responsible for failing to stop NFM if they could not reasonably have known about it, and the FCA would not consider it reasonable to hold them responsible if they did not have authority to act in the particular case.

Withdrawal and/or amendment of examples and factors that risked imposing disproportionate burdens. This includes deleting existing guidance that gave a misleading impression of individual SMF managers’ disclosure obligations and publishing new guidance at COCON 1.3.3G.

Clarification that firms are not expected to investigate trivial or implausible allegations or breach privacy law when assessing fitness and propriety.

The FCA emphasises that no guidance can cover every scenario and firms will always need to exercise their own judgement.

The changes are set out in the Non-Financial Misconduct (No 2) Instrument 2025 (FCA 2025/60) and, together with the rule change in COCON, will come into force on 1 September 2026.

Financial Services Regulatory Forum publishes ninth regulatory initiatives grid

On 11 December 2025, the Financial Services Regulatory Initiatives Forum (FSRIF) published its ninth regulatory initiatives grid (Grid). The members of the FSRIF are the Bank of England, the PRA, the FCA, the Payment Systems Regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, The Pensions Regulator, and the FRC. HM Treasury (HMT) is an observer member.

The ninth edition sets out 124 live initiatives, a 13% reduction compared with the eighth edition published in April 2025. The Annex to the Grid contains a list of initiatives that have been completed or stopped.

Initiatives added to the Grid since the previous edition are:

Multi-sector. The PRA is due to consult on its framework for the prudential treatment of firms' exposure to crypto assets in Q4 2026. Stakeholder engagement and key milestones are expected in H1 2027.

Investment management. The FCA will review data collection for asset managers and funds. Stakeholder engagement is expected between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.

Banking, credit and lending. The FCA expects to publish the findings from the review of high-cost short-term credit price cap in Q3 2026. The FCA plans to consult on its retail banking disclosure rule review in 2026.

Banking, credit and lending. The FCA plans to consult on its review of the retail banking disclosure rule in 2026.

Payment services. HMT expects to publish its response to the September 2024 consultation on a streamlined approach to payment systems regulation in the next four months.

State of suptech report

On 11 December 2025, Cambridge SupTech Lab, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Cambridge Judge Business School, and Digital Transformation Solutions published the State of SupTech Report 2025 (Report).

The Report provides analysis and insights from 312 financial authorities across 172 countries and six continents and is a global benchmark on supervisory technology (suptech).

Key findings of the Report include:

Adoption. Global suptech adoption has accelerated with 197 agencies across 140 countries deploying suptech, more than three times the 2022 adoption figures. Financial authorities in advanced economies have greater deployment compared to their peers in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), highlighting a global capability gap shaped by strategy and governance, skills, infrastructure, and budget constraints.

Suptech value recognition. Recognition of the value of adopting supervisory technologies has increased, with 18% of agencies rating suptech applications as very effective, 33.5% rating applications as moderately effective and 34% as somewhat effective.

Modernisation and AI. Technology adoption shows steady modernisation with continued reliance on foundational tools. AI maturity remains low, with 26% of authorities within the initial exploration stages and only 7% report widespread deployment, with advanced economies significantly ahead (24% compared with less than 1% in EMDEs).

Barriers. The principal barriers have shifted from purely technical issues to operational and human factors. Poor data quality and talent shortages are constraining design, with deployment, costs, and limited internal IT capacity impacting implementation. For AI specifically, data protection and privacy concerns remain paramount, alongside staff skills gaps and technical integration challenges.

Enablers and barrier removal. Authorities with coherent strategies report smoother implementation, higher data quality, and broader deployment, demonstrating the critical link between integrated planning and success. Agencies are actively addressing barriers to adoption through external training, internal training, bilateral partnerships, and peer-learning forums. Development is being led by internal IT departments and business units, with targeted external support from vendors and consultants. Procurement remains formal and structured, dominated by RFPs and tenders, though innovation methods like tech sprints and regulatory sandboxes are emerging, particularly in advanced economies.

The Report closes by observing that while there has been a growth in implementation, to realise the full value of suptech requires ""… more than incremental tool deployment"". It concludes that what is needed is ""… institutional readiness, strategic clarity, and collective action"" including stronger co-ordination across jurisdictions.

FCA publishes new webpage on risk warnings for mainstream investments

On 11 December 2025, the FCA launched its new webpage on risk warnings for mainstream investments. The webpage sets out the expectations the FCA has of firms in promoting investment products and highlights common misconceptions about risk warnings.

The key expectations of the FCA are:

Financial promotions must meet the requirements under the Consumer Duty, in particular, they must be clear, fair and not misleading for the consumer.

Promotion of investment products must comply with key rules under COBS, including that such promotions are fair, clear and not misleading (COBS 4/2/1R(1)) and give a balanced impression of the benefits and risks of an investment product or service (COBS 4.5.2R(2) or COBS 4.5A.3R(2)(b)).

When designing communications, the firm should put themselves in the consumer’s shoes with focus being on what consumers would want or need to know. Where appropriate, this includes testing communications.

A list of consideration questions to be asked by firms when planning promotions are provided on the webpage.

Common misconceptions highlighted are:

FCA update on new cryptoasset regulatory regime

On 8 January 2025, the FCA launched a webpage to provide information on the new UK cryptoasset regulatory regime and how firms should prepare.

Key points to note include:

Commencement of regime and application gateway. The FCA confirmed that the new regime is expected to come into force on 25 October 2027. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 (Regulations) (currently awaiting parliamentary approval) enable the FCA to set a period ahead of the commencement of the regime for businesses to submit applications to the FCA, and this is expected to open in September 2026.

Authorisation. Cryptoasset businesses will need to be authorised by the FCA to do business in the UK and demonstrate that they meet the required standards. Firms that are already authorised by the FCA to undertake other regulated activities will need to have their existing permissions varied before the commencement of the new regime. The FCA's Authorisations team is holding a webinar on 29 January 2026 to introduce the new regime and outline its expectations when assessing authorisation applications. Registration for the webinar can be completed here.

Transitional provision for existing cryptoasset firms. The Regulations provide a transitional provision for existing cryptoasset firms that are unsuccessful in securing authorisation to run-off their UK business in an orderly way and exit the UK market.

FCA launches three consultations on core elements of cryptoasset regulatory regime

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published three consultation papers (CPs) on core elements of its regulatory regime for cryptoassets.

CP25/40 covers proposed rules and guidance for firms conducting regulated cryptoasset activities such as trading platforms, intermediaries (including cryptoasset lending and borrowing), staking, and decentralised finance.

CP25/41 covers proposed rules and guidance based on the designated activities regime (see above) for the offering to the public of qualifying cryptoassets that are or will be admitted to trading on a UK qualifying cryptoasset trading platform (CATP), the admission of qualifying cryptoassets to trading on CATPs, disclosure obligations relating to admissions to trading and the issuance of UK-issued qualifying stablecoins, and requirements to prevent, detect and disrupt market abuse in cryptoasset markets.

CP25/42 sets out the proposed prudential rules and guidance for in-scope cryptoasset firms. It builds on CP25/15, which we discussed in an earlier update.

A detailed review of the CPs is provided in our article here.

The CPs were published a day after the draft Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Regulations 2025 (Regulations) were laid before parliament – see our article here for further detail. The Regulations must now be approved by both Houses of Parliament.

FCA publishes cryptoassets consumer research

On 16 December 2025, the FCA published the sixth edition of its cryptoassets consumer research note.

Key findings of the research include:

Awareness and holdings. Whilst the proportion of UK adults holding cryptoassets declined compared to last year, overall awareness of cryptoassets among the general public remains very high at 91%, with awareness of stablecoins among cryptoasset users continuing to climb, rising to 58% in 2025 from 53% in 2024. The typical value held by investors increased, with more people moving away from small holdings and instead making larger investments.

Centralised exchanges remain the most popular route to purchase. Centralised exchanges remain the most popular method to buy cryptoassets, increasing four percentage points to 73%.

Call for regulation. Among cryptoasset users, 25% would be more likely to invest if greater regulation was applied to cryptocurrencies in the UK.

An additional research note on the impact of cryptoasset regulation on consumer decision-making was published. The research note examines how the availability of information about the regulatory status of cryptoassets and the protections that regulation may provide impacts consumers’ decisions and beliefs.

Notable findings include:

Providing information on regulation and related information significantly impacted consumer decision-making, understanding of the coverage of protections, and trust. For example, informing consumers that cryptoassets are regulated increased demand for cryptoassets.

Participants had a poor understanding of the potential protections under cryptoasset regulation. Providing additional information on protections helped but its impact was limited.

Providing additional information about cryptoassets and the protections that regulation might provide supported consumer understanding of protections and trust in cryptoassets.

However, many participants continued to misunderstand that they lacked certain protections, with the absence of additional information about the coverage of protections, making participants less trusting of the FCA.

Payment services and systems

PSR launches consultation on card scheme and processing fees

On 19 December 2025, the PSR launched a consultation following the March 2025 market review of card scheme and processing fees. The consultation proposes to implement two directions out of the four proposals included within its April 2025 remedies consultation.

The proposals the PSR intends to implement as remedies are:

Information, transparency and complexity remedy (ITC Remedy). This will ensure that acquirers and merchants through their contractual relationship, receive better information to understand the fees they are charged.

Pricing governance remedy (Pricing Governance Remedy). This will ensure that there is evidence behind pricing decisions and is intended to remedy the current absence of evidence showing how pricing decisions are made.

The consultation requests feedback on the form of the directions (draft ITC Remedy direction and draft Pricing Governance Remedy direction).

The PSR will introduce a remedy relating to regulatory financial reporting and expects to consult on a draft direction for such remedy by 31 March 2026. The fourth remedy proposed by the PSR in its April 2025 remedies consultation on the publication of schemes' information to increase transparency will not be implemented.

The deadline for responses is 17:00 on 13 February 2026.

FCA statement on contactless payment limits for PSPs

On 19 December 2025, the FCA confirmed that from 19 March 2026, banks and payment service providers (PSPs) will have flexibility to set their own limit for contactless payments.

The FCA understands that most banks and PSPs are likely to maintain existing contactless limits for the near future. If they do make changes, the FCA expects firms to communicate these to consumers under the Consumer Duty.

From 19 March 2026, Article 11 of the Strong Customer Authentication RTS (SCA RTS) will read:

""Article 11 Contactless payments at point of sale

Subject to compliance with Article 2, payment service providers shall be allowed not to apply strong customer authentication where the payer initiates a contactless electronic payment transaction identified by the payment service provider as posing a low level of risk.""

The formal legal instrument making the changes to the SCA RTS, can be viewed here. Changes will also be made to the FCA's Approach Paper, with confirmation of the rule change included in the Appendix to the FCA's Handbook Notice (No 136, December 2025).

FCA and PSR joint response to HM Treasury payments regulation recommendations

On 17 December 2025, the FCA and PSR published a joint letter sent to HM Treasury (HMT) providing an update on their progress in responding to HMT's payments regulation recommendations.

Key progress updates provided are:

There has been significant enhancement of FCA and PSR co-ordination to address congestion in the regulatory landscape. Collaborative efforts highlighted were the consolidation of PSR functions into the FCA, working jointly with the CMA on digital wallets, and the revision of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority to establish principles for better co-operation.

Substantial progress has been made in the development of open banking and open finance. Initiatives highlighted include the establishment by the FCA of a new department incorporating both FCA and PSR capabilities, industry-led initiatives advancing commercial models for variable recurring payments, with 31 parties funding a group to facilitate the go-live of VRP phase 1 for lower-risk use cases.

The FCA launch of the smart data accelerator focusing on SME lending and mortgages. The FCA intends to publish a roadmap in early 2026 to establish regulatory foundations during 2027.

Consumer protection remains a priority, with significant focus on fighting financial crime and fraud prevention. The PSR's APP fraud reimbursement requirements, which came into effect in October 2024, resulted in 88% of money lost to in-scope scams being returned to victims, with 83% of claims closed within five business days. The regulators are investing in real-time data sharing, intelligence capabilities, and stronger risk management controls to combat fraud and money laundering. Additional measures include updating Strong Customer Authentication requirements to enable more agile regulation, monitoring financial inclusion as services shift online, and implementing a new public-private partnership model to deliver next-generation retail payments infrastructure that supports innovation, competitiveness and security while advancing the government's growth mission.

FCA progress update on Open Banking

On 16 December 2026, the FCA provided an update on the progress of Open Banking.

The number of open banking payments has grown by 53% year on year, with over 16 million users benefiting from the service (compared to 11 million as at November 2024). A key driver for this increase is the rise of variable recurring payments (VRPs), which account for 16% of all open banking payments. VRPs allow consumers and businesses to set up flexible, automated payments tailored to individual needs, offering greater control compared to traditional direct debits.

As part of the update, the FCA and PSR published a joint report on the development and rollout of commercial VRP (cVRP). Through a new organisation, the UK Payments Initiative (UKPI), funded by 31 parties across the sector, the current application of VRP will be extended to 'phase 1' use cases, which include utility payments, financial services payments, and payments to local and central government.

UKPI was incorporated on 16 December 2025. It has agreed fifteen guiding principles, which are set out in the report.

The first live payments under the UKPI scheme are expected to take place in Q1 2026. In time, cVRP will support further use cases such as grocery shopping and online purchase.

HMT is expected to introduce secondary legislation in 2026 under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025. The introduction of the secondary legislation will give the FCA powers to set Open Banking rules and the FCA plans to consult on new rules before the end of 2026 for what's referred to as ""long-term regulatory framework."" Lessons learned from phase 1 of the cVRP will feed into the FCA's rules.

Final report on Independent Review of the Payment and Electronic Money Institution Insolvency Regulations 2021

On 16 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) published the final report on the Independent Review of the Payment and Electronic Money Institution Insolvency Regulations 2021. The final report sets out the findings of the review into the efficacy of the Payment and Electronic Money Special Administration Regime (PESAR). The independent review was initiated by the government in December 2024 (see our January 2025 update).

The final report found that the PESAR is not yet delivering on its core objectives. The procedural complexity, high costs, and reliance on court processes have led to delays and diminished outcomes for customers particularly those who are vulnerable or hold low-value accounts.

The review identified key issues with the PESAR:

Objective structure. The PESAR statutory objectives lack a clear hierarchy, and further clarity is needed to prioritise business rescue and customer transfers.

Court and cost burden. The requirement for court entry and approval of distribution plans is often disproportionate. The review proposes several measures to reduce the cost burden of PESAR proceedings, including providing firms and IPs with an out-of-court entry route to enter the PESAR without in-court approval, to reduce costs and delays, particularly for smaller institutions, and limiting court involvement by reserving court processes for the more complex and/or disputed cases.

Customer fund return. The absence of any FSCS protection is a gap that could be addressed as the industry matures to improve consumer outcomes. The review recommends considering the introduction of FSCS-style protection to enable rapid payouts and provide a robust safety net for customers.

Scalability and contingency planning. The PESAR has not yet been tested on large providers, and more focus may be needed to secure orderly transfers to a new provider or continuity arrangements so merchants can continue taking payments while a replacement is found. The review recommends the development of contingency strategies for the insolvency of major providers.

Market and legal efficiency. Targeted legislative refinements, clearer comfort mechanisms to IPs, and improved creditors' committee functionality are needed to reduce friction and encourage practitioner engagement.

HMT will consider the findings and recommendations of the final report and provide a response in due course.

EU MoU on access by non-bank PSPs to central bank operated payment systems

On 18 December 2025, the EBA published a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the EBA, ECB, NCBs, and NSAs on the co-operation framework for information sharing in support of the access of non-bank payment service providers (PSPs) to central bank operated payment systems.

The MoU operationalises the framework for co-operation and exchange of information between NSAs and NCBs, its primary objectives are to:

establish co-operation between NSAs and NCBs in the EEA for the exchange of information to support NCBs in their assessment of the compliance of NB-PSPs with requirements for granting access to central bank-operated payment systems in the EU

establish procedures in a cross-border scenario for the NCB operating the payment system in the host member state to notify the NSA of the home member state about the NB-PSP's application and the NCB's decision regarding its participation

harmonise the processes and procedures across the EEA for the exchange of information between NSAs and NCBs, by specifying the types of information to be shared, the timing and means of exchange.

To facilitate communication and exchange of information, all NSAs and NCBs will designate single points of contact and notify them to the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB). A standardised notification form for the exchange of information is set out in Annex 1 to the MoU.

The MoU comes into effect on the day following the date on which it was signed by the representatives of each authority.

AI

FATF horizon scan on AI and deepfakes

On 22 December 2025, the FATF published a horizon scan of current and potential Artificial Intelligence (AI) related risks and trends relevant to AML/CTF/CPF compliance.

Recommendations for best practice for enhancement of deep fake detection include the adoption of technological and support tools capable of identifying inconsistencies in video and audio content, enhancing multi layered verification, training for compliance teams working closely with technological service providers, and integrating AI into CDD, transaction monitoring, and investigative workflows.

Key indicators to monitor to assist in the detection of deepfakes in financial activity include suspicious patterns such as co-ordinated activity, rapid transactions to newly opened accounts, and immediate fund withdrawals following deposits. FIUs also monitor for incoherence, such as mismatches between IP addresses and customer profiles or use of a same device by different counterparts and unusually high transaction volumes.

Part two widens the scan to consider other emerging AI risks and trends, providing an overview of potential future risks for AML compliance presented by generative AI, discriminative/predictive AI, and fully automated laundering pipelines operated by AI agents.

EBA's AI Act mapping exercise outcomes published

On 17 December 2025, the EBA published a letter sent to the European Commission detailing the outcome of its mapping exercise on the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act).

The exercise focused on mapping the requirements involving high-risk AI systems under the AI Act against relevant provisions in EU banking and payments sectoral frameworks. In particular, the mapping exercise aimed at identifying and assessing areas of interaction between the AI Act and the EU sectoral legislation.

The outcomes of the mapping exercise are:

The AI Act recognises overlaps between some requirements on high-risk AI systems and EU financial sector law, with targeted derogations and synergies envisaged for such requirements.

The AI Act does not envisage targeted derogations or synergies for other requirements on high-risk AI systems, including human oversight, data governance and cyber security, for which the EBA has found that the EU financial services law already includes a wide range of requirements. Notable examples of existing sufficient requirements includes the extensive coverage of cyber security and business continuity requirements within the EU Digital Operational Resilience Regulation (DORA) framework as required in the AI Act. Additionally, the EBA noted that CRR/CRD requirements already provide a comprehensive and technology-neutral governance and risk management framework that can be leveraged upon when supervising the use of AI tools.

The EBA concludes that the provisions included in the Annex to the letter provide a comprehensive overview of how EU financial services law already address relevant AI Act requirements.

EFAMA launches new and improved AI assessment tool

On 11 December 2025, The European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) launched version 2 of its AI System Assessment Tool. The template assists firms in their assessment of AI use cases in line with the EU AI Act.

Updates to the tool include:

The introduction of a 'DORA-lite' version to help document and assess third party provided AI systems.

The introduction of enhanced functionalities and expanded data fields, focused on a more advanced analysis of business risks, technology considerations and internal governance.

A full copy of updated AI System Assessment Tool can be requested here.

EFAMA has published tutorial videos (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3) to complement the AI-system Assessment Tool.

Operational resilience

ESAs advise on whether statutory auditors should be subject to DORA

On 17 December 2025, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) published a joint report (dated 4 December 2025) (Report) to the European Commission advising on whether statutory auditors should be subject to the EU Digital Operational Resilience Regulation (DORA).

The implications of bringing statutory auditors and audit firms within the scope of DORA identified in the Report are:

Market perspective. Inclusion of statutory auditors and audit firms in the scope of DORA could raise fixed costs and reinforce concentration, limiting audit choice and conflicting with competition and administrative burden reduction objectives.

Auditees’ perspective. Extending DORA requirements to auditors could increase audit fees, with the added value of higher resilience safeguards unlikely to outweigh the cost impact for the audited entities.

Supervisory perspective. National audit oversight authorities would require significant training to supervise DORA compliance.

Implementation & governance perspective. Extending DORA would require adjustments to ICT-incident reporting flows, TLPT authority designation and the Oversight Framework.

Co-operation between authorities. Extending DORA requirements to auditors would raise questions on how to include the auditors’ supervisory authority within the ESAs decision making process.

Inclusion of service providers in the scope of DORA. Unlike many other essential service providers, auditors would be regulated under DORA while similar non-regulated providers would not, raising consistency concerns.

The Report concludes that the identified implications of the application of DORA to the statutory auditors and audit firms outweighs the potential benefits, and therefore, statutory auditors and audit firms should not be included within the scope of DORA at this stage.

Financial crime

FCA fines Nationwide Building Society for financial crime failings

On 11 December 2025, the FCA published the final notice issued to Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide), imposing a fine totalling £44,078,500 for inadequate financial crime systems and controls.

Between October 2016 and July 2021, a number of deficiencies were identified in Nationwide's AML monitoring systems and controls. In particular:

Weaknesses in Nationwide's AML systems and controls had a material impact on its ability to effectively monitor customer relationships. The systems for refreshing customer due diligence and carrying out customer risk assessment were ineffective for all personal current account customers.

Aside from customers already assessed as high risk, and in breach of its own policies, Nationwide had no process for undertaking either periodic or event-driven reviews of a substantial proportion of its customer relationships.

Nationwide was aware that some customers were using personal accounts for business activity, in breach of its terms and conditions. However, it did not offer business current accounts for SMEs at that time so did not have the right processes in place to manage financial crime risks from business activity.

Receipt of Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (JRS) funds into a personal current account is a strong indicator of business use. In total 33,678 JRS payments totalling £64.6 million were paid into 5,191 personal accounts at Nationwide. In one case, Nationwide failed to identify, despite opportunities, a customer using personal current accounts to receive fraudulent JRS payments. The customer received 24 payments totalling £27.3 million over 13 months, with £26.01 million of this deposited over eight days. HMRC recovered £26.5 million but approximately £800,000 remains unrecovered.

Nationwide progressed or implemented a number of workstreams aimed at remediating or uplifting weaknesses in AML monitoring deficiencies, including through an ongoing project aimed at ensuring compliance with the MLRs 2017. However, these workstreams did not address the weaknesses in a sufficiently effective or timely manner.

The FCA found that Nationwide had breached Principle 3, and SYSC rules 6.1.1R and 6.3.1R.

The fine was subject to a 30% stage 1 discount from £62,969,297, pursuant to the FCA's executive settlement procedures.

HM Treasury Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Supervision Report 2024-25

On 8 December 2025, HM Treasury (HMT) published its annual report on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing supervision.

Key updates in the report include:

Supervisory consolidation. Following analysis of consultation evidence, the government has decided to make the FCA the AML/CTF supervisor for professional services firms. A further consultation on the proposed framework for FCA supervision closed on 24 December 2025 (see our December 2025 and November 2025 updates for further detail).

FATF assessment preparation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has begun its fifth round of assessments of global efforts to tackle money laundering, and terrorist and proliferation financing. As part of this, the UK will undergo an in-depth evaluation by its peers, culminating in a Mutual Evaluation Report, which will be published in 2028.

Notable supervisory statistics for the 2024/25 period include:

Registration activity. A total of 12,888 applications from businesses for AML/CTF supervision were received with 933 of those rejected.

Risk categorisation. Approximately 9% of the supervised population were categorised as high-risk. This is broadly in line with prior years of 2023-24 (9%) and 2022-23 (10%).

Direct supervision activity. There were a total of 7,991 direct supervision actions (desk-based reviews and onsite visits) conducted across all 25 supervisors. This represents 8% of supervised firms being subject to direct supervision action in 2024-25, compared to 10% in 2023-24.

Suspicious activity reports (SARs). 1,412 firms were asked to share SARs with their supervisor, with 798 of those being assessed by a supervisor for quality. Of those, 62 were assessed as inadequate.

Enforcement fines. The total sum of fines across all 25 supervisors was £59.5 million, compared to £41.5 million in 2023-24. Across all supervisors, £52.5 million of fines were issued to high-risk businesses, £5.5 million of fines were issued to medium-risk businesses, and £1.5 million of fines to low-risk businesses.

Formal and informal actions. Across all 25 supervisors, 976 formal actions and 731 informal actions were taken against high-risk businesses, 307 formal actions and 555 informal actions were taken against medium-risk businesses, and 235 formal actions and 619 informal actions were taken against low-risk businesses.

Published enforcement actions. In the 2024-25 reporting period, the 25 supervisors published a total of 1,100 of their enforcement actions online.

In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.
The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.

The move comes as part of the Stargate Project announced in January 2025.

This direct capital infusion is designed to accelerate the expansion of data centre and energy infrastructure to meet surging demand for advanced AI computing power—a sector increasingly seen as foundational to future economic growth.

The investment builds upon a much broader, previously pledged $500bn commitment made public at the White House earlier this year.

OpenAI has selected SB Energy to construct and manage its 1.2GW data centre in Milam County, Texas, which was previously announced.

The site will serve as a central component of OpenAI’s infrastructure expansion plans.

In addition to providing dedicated facilities for OpenAI, SB Energy is developing several multi-gigawatt data centre campuses across the region.

Construction on these initial sites has commenced, with service dates expected from 2026 onwards.

The structure of the partnership involves a non-exclusive preferred agreement among OpenAI, SoftBank Group, and SB Energy to create a new model for data centre construction.

This model integrates OpenAI’s design specifications for first-party data centres with SB Energy’s experience in project execution and integrated energy supply to establish scalable infrastructure capable of supporting large-scale AI operations.

OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman said: “Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data centre infrastructure, and energy development and OpenAI’s deep domain expertise in data centre engineering.

“The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimised AI data centres.”

SB Energy’s Milam County project is forecasted to generate significant employment in the area during the construction phase.

The company states that it has designed the facility with measures intended to reduce water usage and plans to add new generating capacity dedicated to powering the site.

This approach seeks to address both operational needs and local grid stability.

To support its growing portfolio of data centres, SB Energy recently completed the acquisition of Studio 151, a company specialising in construction management, procurement, engineering, and operations across more than 20 previous data centre campuses.

The acquisition is intended to strengthen SB Energy’s ability to oversee complex projects internally as demand for data processing continues to rise.

SB Energy co-CEO Rich Hossfeld said: “SB Energy’s strategic partnership with OpenAI accelerates our delivery of advanced AI data centre campuses and associated energy infrastructure at the scale required to advance Stargate and secure America’s AI future.”

Earlier investment rounds have also contributed capital to support SB Energy’s growth trajectory.

In 2025, Ares Infrastructure Opportunities funds invested $800m in redeemable preferred equity, marking their third financing round with SB Energy since 2020.

As part of this expanded relationship, SB Energy will adopt OpenAI products internally by integrating APIs and deploying tools such as ChatGPT for employee use.",https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/OpenAI.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 06:00:44.141794

The latest KPMG and Recruitment & Employment Confederation UK report on jobs, compiled by S&P Global, showed the permanent placements index slipped to 44.3 points in December from 45.5 in November, signalling a sharper contraction.

Any reading below 50 points indicates a month-on-month decline.

Temporary billings also fell for a second consecutive month, though at a milder pace. The temporary billings index edged down to 47.6 points from 48.8, pointing to a modest reduction in demand for short-term staff.

KPMG said firms continued to exercise caution on recruitment after a prolonged period of elevated cost pressures and global economic uncertainty.

""The jobs market at the end of 2025 was still signalling caution,"" said Jon Holt, group chief executive and UK senior partner at KPMG. He added that many companies were pausing hiring and relying more on temporary staff, with restraint likely to persist into the new year until confidence improves.

The survey showed permanent placements have now declined for 39 consecutive months, with recruiters linking December's sharper fall to weak business confidence and concerns around costs.

All monitored English regions saw declines in permanent hiring except the Midlands, where placements rose slightly for the first time since May.

Demand for staff also softened further. The total vacancies index slipped to 43.4 points in December from 43.9 in November, indicating a slightly quicker fall in vacancies at the end of the year.

KPMG and REC noted official data from the Office for National Statistics, which showed vacancies were broadly stable in the three months to November at 729,000, though still 8.3% below pre-pandemic levels.

The total staff availability index stood at 66.3 points in December, only marginally lower than November's 66.5, marking one of the strongest upturns in labour supply since the pandemic.

The permanent salaries index rose to its highest level in seven months, indicating a faster increase in starting salaries, though still below the long-run average.

Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said December data can be difficult to interpret but noted some tentative signs of stabilisation in the second half of 2025.

""With placements falling at a slower pace than the 2025 average in December there is some hope that we are seeing a December dip, rather than a change in the trend,"" he said.

The survey data were collected between December 4 and 17, covering responses from around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Walmart and Wing said over the weekend that they would bring the latter’s on-demand drone delivery to an additional 150 Walmart stores beginning this year and running through 2027.","Amazon is no stranger to this kind of reverse-engineering, given its brick-and-mortar Fresh, Go, and Whole Foods stores. But a new report detailing that the company plans to build a 225,000 sq. ft. everything store—well, that’s just the natural evolution of things, isn’t it?

Two decades ago, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos acknowledged: “We are physical creatures and we like to move around in our environment.” And what better place to do that than a fully immersive suburban superstore?

Indonesia and Malaysia temporarily restrict Grok

Indonesia and Malaysia restricted access to the Grok over the weekend, making them the first countries to do so in response to the AI chatbot’s generation of sexual content.

The temporary block intends “to protect women, children, and the public from the risks of fake pornographic content generated using the artificial intelligence technology,"" said Meutya Hafid, Indonesia’s communication and digital affairs minister, in a statement.

Malaysia joined Indonesia in blocking the service, which is available through the social media service X as well as in a standalone app, until proper safeguards are implemented.

Elon Musk’s xAI was roundly denounced last week for allowing Grok users to generate undressed images of women and children.

On Friday, the company restricted image generation and alteration functions to paid subscribers.

The Southeast Asian nations weren’t the only countries to express concern about xAI’s practices. The Brits were unsparing about Grok’s missteps—U.K. tech secretary Liz Kendall called them “an insult and totally unacceptable”—and India wasn’t much kinder, ordering xAI to make changes and submit a report on them within 72 hours.

“Sorry for the inconvenience,” Grok posted on X about the national blocks. “xAI is actively working to address the issue. In the meantime, using a VPN might help bypass the restriction.” —AN

The Instagram breach that wasn’t (or was?)

A whole lot of Instagram users received a suspicious password reset email in recent days, suggesting that the Meta social media service was having cybersecurity issues.

Not true, the company said Saturday.

“We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people,” it wrote in a statement. “There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure.”

Phew, right?

Not so fast, one U.S. cybersecurity company says.

Malwarebytes insists that, in fact, cybercriminals have successfully stolen private data for 17.5 million Instagram accounts—physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.—and made them “available for sale on the dark web.”

So what gives?

The word on the cyber street is that they’re both being truthful. Instagram may have indeed had a password reset email oopsie—but that has nothing to do with the very real data scrape (not breach!) in late 2024 that recently exposed users’ private information.

Keep your digital head on a swivel, folks. —AN

Walmart to add Wing to another 150 stores

Alphabet’s drone delivery service is spreading its wings a little wider.

Walmart and Wing said over the weekend that they would bring the latter’s on-demand drone delivery to an additional 150 Walmart stores beginning this year and running through 2027.

For the unfamiliar, Wing will bring many (but not all) items you’d find in a Walmart to your door in “as little as 30 minutes.”

Groceries or over-the-counter medicine, rain or shine—Wing will bring the goods. (Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these drones. OK, maybe a little snow will ground them after all.)

The companies currently operate their service in Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Seven months ago, they announced that they’d add drone delivery service in Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa.

More U.S. metros are reportedly on tap, including Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Louis. Once the expansion is complete, Wing says it will deliver Walmart goods from some 270 stores and “serve about 10% of the U.S. population.” —AN

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Health and wellness queries already account for a significant portion of ChatGPT usage. According to OpenAI, more than 230 million people globally ask health-related questions on the platform each week, based on de-identified conversation analysis. ChatGPT Health builds on this usage by enabling users to connect medical records and wellness applications to provide additional context for responses.

The feature allows users to securely link data from medical records and select wellness apps, including Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. With these connections, ChatGPT Health can assist users in interpreting test results, preparing for medical appointments, reviewing diet and fitness patterns, and understanding insurance options. OpenAI states that the service is intended to support everyday health understanding and is not designed for diagnosis or treatment.

ChatGPT Health operates as a separate space within ChatGPT, with additional privacy and security controls designed for sensitive health data. Health conversations, connected apps, and files are stored independently from other chats, with separate memory systems intended to keep health-related information compartmentalized. While ChatGPT may use limited contextual information from non-health conversations to improve relevance, OpenAI says health information does not flow back into standard chats.

OpenAI adds that conversations within ChatGPT Health are not used to train its foundation models. Users can view or delete health-related memories through the settings interface. If a health-related discussion begins outside the Health environment, users may be prompted to move the conversation into ChatGPT Health to access the additional protections.

The company says the feature was developed in collaboration with physicians across multiple regions. Over a two-year period, more than 260 physicians from 60 countries and a range of specialties reviewed AI-generated responses, providing feedback on more than 600,000 outputs across 30 areas of focus. This input informed how the system communicates health information, including when to recommend follow-up with healthcare professionals.

ChatGPT Health is being rolled out initially to a limited group of users for feedback and refinement. Users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are eligible to join a waitlist. OpenAI says it plans to expand access and make the feature broadly available on web and iOS in the coming weeks. Some medical record integrations and third-party apps are currently available only in the United States, and Apple Health integration requires iOS.",https://cioafrica.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/51f176-20250930-a-smartphone-displaying-the-logo-of-the-artificial-intelligence-openai-research-laboratory-2000.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 05:00:56.768006

Trelleborg AB does not ship phones, EVs or cloud subscriptions. Instead, it sits quietly inside the products and infrastructure that define modern industry: electric cars, offshore wind turbines, commercial aircraft, biopharma manufacturing, mining equipment and advanced logistics systems. Whenever something has to be sealed, insulated, damped, protected or made to last under brutal operating conditions, there is a good chance a Trelleborg solution is somewhere in the bill of materials.

This Swedish engineering group has spent decades turning advanced polymers and engineered materials into mission?critical components. Today, Trelleborg AB is effectively a global platform for sealing solutions, engineered systems and industrial protection – a position it has sharpened after divesting its conventional tyre business and aggressively doubling down on higher?margin, knowledge?intensive niches.

The strategic bet: in a world racing to electrify transport, build renewable energy capacity, automate factories and harden infrastructure, demand for reliable, high?performance sealing and polymer solutions will grow faster than the underlying industries. Trelleborg AB wants to own that layer – and monetize it with deep application know?how rather than simply selling commodity rubber parts.

Inside the Flagship: Trelleborg AB

Trelleborg AB today is organized around specialized business areas that translate polymer science into tailored, application?specific systems. The company’s core franchise is no longer tyres but advanced sealing solutions, engineered materials and protective systems that enable demanding customers to hit tougher regulations, safety standards and efficiency targets.

On the product level, Trelleborg AB’s flagship offering is not a single SKU but an ecosystem of high?performance solutions that cluster around three themes: sealing, damping and protection. Within that, several product families stand out as strategic flagships.

1. Trelleborg Sealing Solutions – from EV battery packs to biopharma lines

Trelleborg Sealing Solutions is arguably the crown jewel. It designs and manufactures precision seals, gaskets, O?rings, rotary seals and engineered polymer components that must survive extremes of pressure, temperature, friction and chemical exposure. These are the tiny parts that decide whether a hydraulic system leaks, a wind turbine gearbox lasts, or a drug production line avoids contamination.

Key features across this portfolio include:

Advanced material science: Proprietary elastomers, thermoplastics and composite materials tailored for conditions such as deep?sea pressure, aggressive chemicals, sterilization cycles or ultra?low friction environments.

Application?specific design: Seals and components are not sold as generic catalog items; they are co?designed with OEMs in sectors like aerospace, medical technology, food and beverage, and energy. The IP is as much in the application engineering as in the material recipe.

Digital design tools: Trelleborg offers online calculators, material selectors and design simulators to engineers, embedding itself early in the design cycle. This consultative model raises switching costs and helps the company shape specifications.

Where this becomes especially visible is in fast?growing segments such as electric vehicles and biopharma. In EVs, Trelleborg AB provides seals for battery housings, thermal management systems and drivetrains where reliability and fire safety are non?negotiable. In life sciences and biopharma, its high?purity, regulatory?compliant seals and tubing support sterile processing and clean?in?place systems.

2. Trelleborg Industrial Solutions – infrastructure, offshore and energy

Trelleborg’s industrial and marine solutions bring the same polymer sophistication to large?scale infrastructure and energy projects. Here, the product set ranges from marine fenders and docking systems to tunnel gaskets, offshore oil and gas solutions and vibration isolation systems for heavy equipment.

Typical flagship?grade offerings include:

Marine fender systems: Engineered rubber fenders and docking solutions that protect ports and vessels, optimized for energy absorption, durability and environmental performance.

Tunnel sealing and water management: Gaskets and waterproofing systems for metro, road and water tunnels, designed to last decades under varying pressure and chemical exposure.

Vibration and noise control: Anti?vibration mounts, bearings and isolation systems that protect buildings, machines and vehicles from wear and structural damage.

These products benefit directly from the global push for resilient infrastructure and renewable energy. Offshore wind jacket foundations, for instance, require complex sealing and protection solutions that can endure constant motion, saltwater and high mechanical loads. That is where Trelleborg’s materials lab and field experience converge.

3. New frontiers: electrification, sustainability and lightweighting

What makes Trelleborg AB particularly relevant right now is how deliberately it has pivoted its product roadmap toward electrification, sustainability and lightweighting – three mega?trends that cut across almost every heavy industry.

Across its portfolio, the company is investing in:

Low?friction, energy?efficient seals that cut power losses in hydraulic systems and drivetrains.

Lightweight composite and polymer components that replace metal in aerospace and automotive, improving range and fuel efficiency.

Environmentally improved materials, reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), increasing recyclability and achieving compliance with ever?stricter environmental regulation.

Solutions for e?mobility and renewable energy, where sealing and insulation performance determine safety, uptime and warranty risk.

Put simply, Trelleborg AB is transforming from an industrial supplier of rubber parts into a knowledge?heavy technology company built on materials science, application engineering and regulatory expertise. That combination has become its de?facto unique selling proposition – and it is what makes the business much harder to disrupt than its humble components suggest.

Market Rivals: Trelleborg Aktie vs. The Competition

In sealing, vibration control and advanced polymer components, Trelleborg faces a set of highly capable rivals. Unlike in consumer tech, the competition here is fragmented, specialized and heavily influenced by regional strengths and long?term customer relationships.

Three competitor ecosystems stand out: Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, Parker Hannifin’s Engineered Materials and SKF’s sealing and polymer solutions portfolio.

Freudenberg Sealing Technologies vs. Trelleborg Sealing Solutions

Compared directly to Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, Trelleborg Sealing Solutions competes for many of the same OEM and Tier?1 automotive, industrial and energy accounts. Freudenberg brings deep expertise in elastomer technology and a strong presence in automotive powertrain and industrial seals.

Strengths of Freudenberg Sealing Technologies:

Longstanding relationships with global automotive OEMs.

Strong presence in radial shaft seals and powertrain components.

Broad geographic manufacturing base.

Where Trelleborg AB pushes back:

Broader penetration outside classic internal combustion platforms, especially in electric vehicles, aerospace and life sciences.

Stronger emphasis on co?engineering and digital design tools for customers.

A more focused corporate profile after decoupling from the tyre business, making sealing a centerpiece rather than one unit among many.

In non?automotive markets – for example in biopharma processing or offshore wind – Trelleborg often looks less like a direct head?to?head rival and more like a specialist partner that brings specific materials and application expertise.

Parker Hannifin Engineered Materials vs. Trelleborg AB

Parker Hannifin, through its Engineered Materials Group and Parker Seals, is another heavyweight in high?performance sealing and polymer solutions. Its Parker Sealing & Shielding product family competes directly with Trelleborg Sealing Solutions in aerospace, defense, semiconductors and industrial automation.

Compared directly to Parker Seals and Engineered Materials, Trelleborg AB usually operates with a leaner, more focused industrial portfolio. Parker brings system?level breadth: it not only sells seals but also fluid connectors, motion systems and complete subsystems.

Parker’s advantages include:

Deep integration with hydraulic, pneumatic and motion control systems.

Ability to bundle components into larger subsystem contracts.

Strong footprint in North American industrial markets.

Trelleborg AB’s counterpositioning:

A more specialized focus on materials science and sealing, often giving it an edge in extreme environment applications.

Lower apparent complexity for customers who want best?in?class components rather than fully integrated systems.

Fewer internal conflicts when collaborating with third?party system integrators, since Trelleborg is not trying to own the entire system stack.

In practice, large OEMs and infrastructure developers often dual?source between Parker and Trelleborg, but Trelleborg can win on the basis of niche technical performance, lifecycle cost and customization.

SKF Sealing Solutions vs. Trelleborg AB

SKF is best known for bearings, but its SKF Sealing Solutions and engineered polymer offerings directly challenge Trelleborg AB in rotating equipment, industrial machinery and heavy vehicles.

Compared directly to SKF Sealing Solutions, Trelleborg AB diverges sharply in strategy:

SKF uses seals to complement its bearing systems, optimizing performance of the full mechanical assembly.

Trelleborg offers sealing solutions as a standalone, platform?level business that spans many more applications beyond rotating equipment.

In markets such as wind turbines or heavy industrial machinery, SKF might present a highly integrated bearings?plus?seals package, while Trelleborg positions its offer as vendor?neutral, focusing purely on maximizing sealing performance, uptime and maintenance intervals.

The net effect: where competitors often embed sealing inside broader mechanical or motion portfolios, Trelleborg AB is deliberately carving out a specialist identity as a high?end polymer technology partner across multiple industries.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Trelleborg AB’s real product is not any single gasket or fender, but a defensible combination of advanced materials, application expertise, global reach and niche dominance. Several competitive advantages stand out.

1. Deep specialization in demanding niches

While many industrial giants chase volume, Trelleborg AB systematically targets segments where failure is catastrophically expensive and reliability is priced at a premium: offshore energy, aerospace, medical and biopharma equipment, tunneling and high?end industrial automation.

In those spaces, the purchasing logic is not “who is cheapest” but “who understands my application, can co?design with my engineers and will still support this platform ten years from now.” Trelleborg’s long history in sealing and protection, combined with sector?specific teams, gives it an edge in these conversations.

2. Materials science as core IP

Many competitors can mold rubber or machine plastics. The differentiation for Trelleborg AB lies in the chemistry: proprietary elastomer and thermoplastic formulations, composite structures and surface treatments tuned to specific combinations of temperature, pressure, friction and chemical exposure.

This makes the performance of Trelleborg AB’s solutions difficult to replicate. Even if a rival matches the geometry of a seal, it may not be able to match lifetime performance, friction behavior or compatibility with specific process media. Over thousands of operating hours, that difference translates into fewer leaks, less downtime and longer maintenance intervals – a compelling value proposition for operators.

3. Embedded early in the design cycle

By offering design tools, simulation support and co?engineering capabilities, Trelleborg AB gets involved early in customer projects. Once the seal or polymer solution is “designed in,” switching suppliers becomes expensive, risky and time?consuming for the OEM.

This early engagement model is one of the most powerful competitive moats in the B2B components world. It also allows Trelleborg to shape specifications and nudge customers toward higher?value, higher?margin solutions that only a handful of vendors can deliver.

4. Sustainability aligned with customer pressure

Industrial buyers are under intense pressure to decarbonize and reduce environmental impact. Trelleborg AB’s move toward lighter, energy?efficient and more environmentally friendly materials is not simply brand polish; it is becoming a technical requirement to qualify for future projects.

By converting sustainability from a compliance checkbox into a product feature – better lifecycle performance, reduced energy use, fewer leaks and failures – Trelleborg can command premium pricing and win tenders where regulation and ESG metrics matter as much as upfront cost.

5. A cleaner, more focused corporate story

After exiting the traditional tyre business, Trelleborg AB has a tighter strategic narrative: a focused engineered?polymers company built around sealing, damping and protection. Internally, that frees up capital and management attention to invest in the technology and markets that matter most. Externally, it makes it easier for customers and investors to understand what the company is about – and why its margins should look more like a technology?driven industrial than a commodity manufacturer.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Trelleborg Aktie (ISIN SE0000114837) reflects this shift from broad industrial conglomerate to focused technology?enabled niche leader. As of the latest available market data checked via multiple financial sources (including major real?time quote platforms), Trelleborg AB trades on the Stockholm exchange with a valuation profile that increasingly prices in its higher?margin, specialist positioning.

At the time of the most recent quotes retrieved, the stock was trading around its current range with data consistent across at least two independent financial providers. Where intraday data was not available, pricing referred to the last closing level, clearly marked as such by those sources. That price embeds the market’s view on how successfully Trelleborg AB is transforming its portfolio and executing on growth in areas such as sealing solutions for electrification, offshore energy protection systems and life?science processing equipment.

The relationship between the product strategy and Trelleborg Aktie’s performance runs along three key axes:

Margin mix improvement: As the company exits lower?margin, more commoditized segments and invests in advanced sealing and engineered systems, its product mix tilts toward offerings where materials science and application knowledge justify higher gross margins. That supports a valuation closer to technology?driven industrial peers than to basic materials players.

Exposure to structural growth sectors: By aligning product development with long?term themes – such as electric mobility, renewable energy infrastructure, biopharma and high?spec industrial automation – Trelleborg AB is effectively decoupling part of its growth profile from the classic cyclicality of heavy industry. Investors buying Trelleborg Aktie are paying not just for GDP?linked volume but for structurally expanding end markets.

Resilience via niche dominance: Because its products are deeply embedded and often specified into critical systems, Trelleborg enjoys relatively sticky revenue and strong pricing power. Those dynamics tend to support more stable free cash flow across cycles – a feature that equity markets reward with higher multiples when the strategy is credible and execution consistent.

In analyst commentary and investor materials, Trelleborg AB consistently highlights its focus on “selected segments” where it can achieve leading positions globally. That approach is directly tied to the performance of Trelleborg Aktie: each incremental win in a specialized sealing or protection niche tends to be disproportionately accretive to profitability and perceived quality of earnings.

There is still execution risk. The transition away from traditional tyre and commodity products puts more pressure on R&D, on maintaining talent in materials science and on consistently winning high?specification projects against formidable competitors like Freudenberg, Parker Hannifin and SKF. But if Trelleborg AB continues to convert its polymer science and co?engineering capabilities into sticky, value?added product lines, the stock remains tightly coupled to a story of gradual multiple expansion and disciplined, niche?driven growth.

Crucially, investors are not just buying cyclical exposure to industrial capex. They are buying a high?tech, materials?driven infrastructure layer that quietly sits under electric cars, offshore wind farms, metro tunnels and sterile manufacturing plants. That is the real product Trelleborg AB is building – and the reason its stock has increasingly been viewed through a technology?adjacent, rather than purely commodity?industrial, lens.

In an era where the most important technologies often disappear into the hardware and infrastructure we take for granted, Trelleborg AB is a reminder that the future is not only coded in software. Sometimes it is molded, extruded and vulcanized into silent components that never draw attention – unless they fail. Trelleborg’s business, and the trajectory of Trelleborg Aktie, is built on ensuring they do not.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405018_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 05:01:12.173593

If Rubin and physical AI themes have you thinking beyond a single name, this could be a good moment to scan other that sit across the broader AI story.

So with Rubin in full swing, partnerships across autos, industrials and media, and NVIDIA trading at $184.86 with mixed recent returns but very large 5 year gains, are you looking at an overlooked entry point or a market that has already priced in years of AI growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 46.4% Undervalued

According to RobertoAllende, the narrative fair value for NVIDIA at US$345.07 sits well above the last close of US$184.86, setting up a wide valuation gap.

NVIDIA's latest quarterly earnings report, released this week, showcases a company that has successfully navigated one of the most challenging questions in modern tech investing: How do you justify a multi-trillion dollar valuation in an era of AI hype? The answer, it turns out, lies in execution. Record Performance Driven by Blackwell NVIDIA reported Q3 FY2026 revenue of $57.0 billion, marking a 62% increase year-over-year and a 22% sequential gain from the previous quarter. The company's Data Center segment, which now represents the overwhelming majority of revenue, reached $51.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago.

Want to see what is behind that valuation gap? The narrative leans on heavyweight revenue, thick margins and a future earnings multiple that assumes sustained high growth.

Result: Fair Value of US$345.07 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this hinges on hyperscalers keeping AI spending high, and on competitors and custom chips not eating into NVIDIA’s margins or customer concentration.

Another View: Our DCF Says Overvalued

RobertoAllende’s narrative points to a fair value of US$345.07 and calls NVIDIA undervalued, but our DCF model lands in a very different place. With a fair value estimate of US$162.43 versus the current US$184.86, it flags the shares as overvalued instead.

That gap suggests the market might already be baking in a lot of future AI success. The question for you is simple: do you lean toward the richer narrative assumptions or the more restrained cash flow math?

But here’s the real talk: is Uber just a daily life essential... or a sneaky stock you should’ve bought yesterday?

Because while you were doomscrolling, Uber’s share price has been on a roller coaster that looks like a meme stock – big rallies, brutal dips, and nonstop headlines around profitability, regulation, and AI-powered everything.

You already know the app. But do you actually know what’s happening with the stock behind it – Uber Technologies Aktie, ISIN US90353T1007?

Let’s break it down: hype, numbers, rivals, and whether Uber is a cop or drop for your portfolio.

The Hype is Real: Uber Technologies on TikTok and Beyond

Uber is more than a ride now – it’s a full-on content category. Creators are dropping:

“I drove Uber for a week – here’s how much I actually made.”

“I only ate Uber Eats for 7 days – my wallet cried.”

Hot takes on whether Uber is the next big tech stock or a burnout waiting to happen.

On TikTok and YouTube, Uber content is all over:

Drivers flexing payouts, or exposing how bad peak hours really are.

Riders ranting about surge prices and celebrating cheap off-peak rides.

Finance creators breaking down whether Uber stock is a long-term hold or a red flag.

The clout level? High. This isn’t some quiet boomer stock. It’s a name everyone recognizes, uses, and argues about. Which is exactly why it keeps trending every time the share price pops or drops.

The Business Side: Uber Technologies Aktie

Time for money talk. You know the brand. But what about the stock – Uber Technologies, ISIN US90353T1007?

Stock data status: Real-time quotes require live market access. As of the latest available public data from major finance portals, markets may be closed or prices may be delayed. That means you should always confirm the current price yourself before making a move.

Here’s how to check it in two taps:

Search for “Uber stock” or ticker UBER on Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or your broker app.

Look for the latest quote, the day’s move in %, and the 52-week range to see if you’re buying high or catching a dip.

Why are investors locked in on this name?

Massive scale: Rides, food, grocery, and freight – Uber is basically a logistics layer on your phone.

Profitability push: After years of burning cash, it’s been pivoting hard toward actually making money instead of just chasing growth.

Brand power: It’s a verb. That kind of mindshare is rare – and Wall Street knows it.

The real flex: Uber has shifted its story from “we’ll make money one day” to “we’re working on efficiency and margins now.” That switch is what usually turns a hype stock into a serious long-term play – if they deliver.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Uber a game-changer or overhyped? Let’s hit the three big pillars that actually matter.

1. The Product You Touch Every Week

Uber is no longer just “tap car, get car.” You’ve got:

Uber Rides: Classic car, UberX, Uber Comfort, shared rides where available.

Uber Eats: Food, snacks, grocery, convenience runs when you don’t want to move.

Memberships and passes: Sub-style features with fee cuts and perks for power users.

For you as a user, it’s a must-have app. When your train gets canceled or you’re starving at midnight, you’re not opening a spreadsheet – you’re opening Uber. That kind of dependence is exactly what makes investors look twice.

2. The Money Machine Under the Hood

Is Uber “worth the hype” financially? That depends on what you’re chasing.

If you want instant stability, Uber is still not a sleepy dividend stock. It’s a high-energy, high-sensitivity tech play.

If you’re okay with volatility, Uber is more like a long ride with surge pricing: big moves up, big moves down, and serious reward if you catch the timing.

The company has been leaning hard into profitability and efficiency, cutting losses in some regions and doubling down where it actually wins.

Real talk: this is not a “set it and forget it” utility stock. It’s a story stock that’s aging into something more mature – and that transition is where traders either make bank or panic sell.

3. The Risk Side Nobody Likes to Talk About

Uber is powerful, but not invincible. Big risks:

Regulation drama: Cities and countries keep fighting over how to classify drivers, what benefits they get, and how gig work should be regulated.

Driver supply: If drivers bounce to better-paying gigs, wait times and prices go up – and users complain fast.

Competition pressure: Other apps want the same riders, same restaurants, same drivers – and they’re not shy about discounts.

If regulators go hard, costs go up. If competition gets brutal, promos eat into profits. That tug-of-war is baked into the stock price – and it’s why you see those wild swings on big news days.

Uber Technologies vs. The Competition

Let’s talk rivalry. Ride-hailing and delivery is a clout war, and Uber is in the middle of it.

Uber vs. Lyft (Rides)

Brand: Uber is the global name. Lyft is more US-focused, more niche.

Scale: Uber wins. More cities, more drivers, more use cases.

App usage: In a lot of markets, people only have Uber installed. That’s brutal for rivals.

Clout winner on rides: Uber. Bigger, louder, more embedded in your life.

Uber Eats vs. DoorDash and Others (Food & Grocery)

DoorDash is huge in food delivery in the US, especially in the suburbs.

Uber Eats leans into urban zones, cross-sells users from rides, and adds grocery and convenience.

Both blast out promos, free deliveries, and subs to get you hooked.

Who wins? Depends on where you live, but in pure brand-layer terms, Uber has a secret weapon: one app for move me and feed me. That ecosystem play hits different.

The Real Battle: Super-App Status

Uber is quietly chasing “super-app” energy in the West – rides, food, packages, maybe more over time. While in some regions other platforms dominate, Uber is one of the few US-listed names trying to be your default logistics app.

In the clout war, Uber wins on:

Name recognition

Global reach

Everyday utility

The trade-off? With great clout comes great scrutiny – from regulators, drivers, and investors who now expect real profits, not just vibes.

Real Talk: Price, Performance, and Hype

You’re probably wondering: “Okay, but is it a no-brainer at the current price?”

Here’s how to think about it, without needing a finance degree:

Check the chart: Look at 1-year and 5-year performance of UBER on any finance app. If it’s near the top of its 52-week range, you may be paying up for good news already priced in.

Look for pullbacks: When the stock drops on market-wide selloffs but the business story hasn’t changed much, that’s when long-term believers usually get interested.

Match it to your risk level: If you freak out on every 5% dip, this might not be your comfort stock.

Uber is not some hidden gem no one’s heard of. It’s a giant, visible, over-analyzed name. That means less “secret upside” but more liquidity and attention. News hits fast. Price moves fast. You have to be ready for that.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, is Uber Technologies a must-have or an overhyped relic from the first wave of app unicorns?

If you’re a user, Uber is basically a game-changer in daily life. It gives you time back, bails you out when transit fails, and lets you turn hunger into a notification. On pure lifestyle impact? Definitely worth the hype.

If you’re an investor, it’s more nuanced:

Uber has serious brand power and scale.

It is pushing toward better margins and profitability, which is a major unlock for long-term value.

But it comes with real risk: regulation, competition, and those attention-grabbing price swings.

Cop or drop?

Cop (for some): If you’re into big, recognizable tech names, can handle volatility, and think Uber will stay the default app for rides and food for years, it can be a long-term hold candidate.

Drop (or avoid): If you hate watching your portfolio swing or you want boring, predictable stocks, Uber is probably too extra for your taste.

Bottom line: Uber Technologies is still worth the hype as a business, but not a blind no-brainer at any price. Treat it like what it is – a powerful, world-changing platform that still lives in the high-risk, high-drama side of the market.

Obviously brands want the shine of legitimate Hollywood entertainment.
Zac Ryder, cofounder and co-chief creative officer of Modern Arts, says this feature is going to be a game-changer for brand entertainment.
LVMH’s entertainment division, 22 Montaigne, for example, is developing projects with Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, as well as Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment.
Many believed brand entertainment was just a glorified long commercial.","We’ve had branded entertainment since Procter & Gamble invented soap operas back in the 1930s. But today, brands are forced to diversify the ways in which they gain and hold our attention. It’s no longer as viable or effective to depend on traditional paid media tools.

Innovative marketers are increasingly investing in content and experiences that attract and engage audiences rather than interrupt and annoy them. And the shift is driving results. Brands of all stripes talk about “brand entertainment,” but it’s the exceptions that truly create actual entertainment.

I’ve spent a lot of time this past year writing and talking on the Brand New World podcast about the variety of ways different brands are doing this right. From WhatsApp working with Modern Arts on a Netflix doc about the Mercedes F1 team, to Dick’s Sporting Goods formally establishing an internal entertainment studio that has already won Sports Emmys for We Could Be King in 2015 and The Turnaround in 2024, to the unprecedented deal struck between AB InBev and Netflix. The latter, signed in November, puts the global brewer’s major beer brands front and center in Netflix’s push into live sports, as well as giving it early access to placement and integration in Netflix shows and movies.

Obviously brands want the shine of legitimate Hollywood entertainment. But production costs and other financial pressures have made working with brands a much more attractive prospect for Hollywood too. So I wanted to check back in with the executives behind some of these projects to find out what they anticipate the biggest developments will be in 2026.

The most significant drivers of these developments stem from the evolving platforms, fueled by audience preferences and behavior, as well as the economic realities driving brands and Hollywood into each other’s arms more often and in more varied ways.

Marketers—and audiences, for that matter—are going to see some big changes coming to screens, both big and small. Read on for what to expect.

Shifting platforms

Meta announced on December 16 that it would begin testing its Instagram for TV app in the U.S. on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices. Zac Ryder, cofounder and co-chief creative officer of Modern Arts, says this feature is going to be a game-changer for brand entertainment. Brands as varied as UPS, Bud Light, and Sephora have been building audiences on Instagram Reels and Stories, while other brands are jumping into the micro-drama trend of serialized, bite-size soap operas in vertical video.

Ryder says this shift means brand content on the platform will continue to look even more like entertainment, getting longer and more ambitious to better align with TV viewing behavior. Ultimately, this will further blur the lines between entertainment and social.

Ryder says that as a result we’ll start to see more big swings featuring A-list storytellers and talent this year. “This will be especially true for brands who are already very invested in IG and have spent years building their followers. And of course, if brands are going to start dropping more ambitious work on IG, they’ll drop it on YouTube as well,” he says. “In order to compete for brand dollars, streamers will need to become even better partners to brands, all of which will create even more energy in this space and raise the bar even higher.”

A growing number of people are watching YouTube (and soon, Instagram Reels) on their TVs. Meanwhile, streamers like Netflix and Disney+ are increasingly utilizing brand partnerships to keep subscriber prices competitive. Many of my sources believe these changing dynamics of how we watch and engage with entertainment will drive where brands can find the best opportunities.

“I suspect we’ll see more next-generation partnerships like those we’ve been involved with this past year, especially as the Warner Bros. thing sorts itself out,” says Jae Goodman, cofounder and CEO of Superconnector Studios. “I bet Skydance/Paramount, Disney, Amazon, Comcast/NBCU will all come to market with brands as true partners in surprising, innovative, mutually beneficial, and I bet very effective ways.”

A new strategy

Goodman helped broker the Netflix-AB InBev deal and has also helped giants like Nike and LVMH set up their entertainment strategies. He says the long-standing trajectory of how brands and Hollywood do business has fundamentally changed.

Typically, it’s TV networks and streamers selling ad space to media agencies, then creative agencies filling the order. Film studios and distributors sell partnerships to brands, then licensing and promotional agencies get creative with the intellectual property.

“Brands are now entering the market with real entertainment strategies,” Goodman says. “And brands are leading the conversation with entertainment entities by asking, ‘What if we wanted to achieve XYZ and then figure out the structure and cost?’ We refer to it as idea flow before deal flow.”

This past year, the Martin Agency worked with Subway Takes creator Kareem Rahma on “UPS Business Trips.” Martin’s chief brand officer, Elizabeth Paul, believes branded entertainment is growing up and moving from bloated bandwagons with hundreds of brand sponsors (see: Wicked) to fewer projects with a more focused audience.

UPS is a major brand that could easily jump on the blockbuster movie bandwagon or make a Super Bowl ad. Instead, “UPS Business Trips” was a relatively small, Subway Takes-inspired series in which Rahma and UPS drivers visit small-business customers. According to the agency, it had more than 100 million views across platforms, and generated 1,000% return on ad spend.

“For those who truly believe in the space, brand entertainment will stop being treated as a campaign format and start being managed as a portfolio,” says Paul, who suggests that the best brands will start thinking like studios, not marketing departments.

We’ve seen this most recently with Dick’s Sporting Goods’s new in-house studio division, Cookie Jar & a Dream Studios. Dick’s CMO Emily Silver told me back in September that this move will see the brand be more aggressive in the number of films and pieces of content it releases, as well as help the brand build more of a name for itself in the entertainment industry to attract different writers and projects.

“It gives us the opportunity to put a little more structure and framework around what content we want to produce and where we want to lean in to help build for the long term,” she said at the time.

New economics

The most significant factor in the pace of brand entertainment’s evolution is the business imperative from both sides to make the economics work. North American box office revenue for 2025 was more than 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels. And in the first half of 2025, major streamers ordered 24% fewer first-run and renewed scripted titles than the same period in 2024.

As production costs have skyrocketed, and the ability to get entertainment projects off the ground more difficult, Hollywood’s typically cool condescension toward marketers has thawed to the point of giddy embrace. Cynically, even if Hollywood sees brands as logo-plastered ATMs, brands see an opportunity to exploit this need for cash to do cool things that are actual entertainment.

“Last year, economic pressure forced marketers to be really choiceful with their media plans, which forced intentionality,” says Paul. “As brands got more selective, the most successful collaborations meant fewer swings with clearer creative intent. The result wasn’t louder brand entertainment, but more considered work—projects that respected fandom, embraced specificity, and trusted audiences to meet brands halfway.”

Paul cites the Martin Agency’s work on Bud Light’s Armchair Quarterback last year, a Netflix partnership starring Peyton Manning that parodies the second season of the streamer’s show Quarterback. Armchair Quarterback attracted more than 100 million social impressions, thanks in no small part to tapping into the fandom of Quarterback by working with the show, its producers—Manning’s Omaha Productions—and Netflix.

However, she reiterates that this can’t be a simple “exchange of relevance for cash. This is about forging true strategic partnerships that delight fans and move markets.”

Talent magnet

The relationship between Hollywood and brands has evolved significantly over the past year. Brand partnerships and content are not embarrassing for studios or streamers anymore, in part because of the aforementioned economics, but also because the quality is higher and the value is clear.

WhatsApp’s film The Seat, for example, cost about as much as it would to make and buy ad time for a 60-second commercial. But it also was high enough quality to stand on its own on Netflix. This is a virtuous cycle: The better the quality, the higher caliber of talent is attracted to subsequent projects, which in turn should continue to boost the caliber of these projects.

Ryder says a growing number of A-list showrunners, writers, directors, and creators have been reaching out to learn more about the brand world in hopes of finding a project to work on together.

LVMH’s entertainment division, 22 Montaigne, for example, is developing projects with Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, as well as Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment.

“When we started making these kinds of brand projects 10 years ago, everyone on the talent side was so suspicious,” Ryder says. Many believed brand entertainment was just a glorified long commercial. That has changed as more high-quality films have dropped. “It’s a bit like a Michelin chef trying a killer food truck and realizing that could be a new outlet for their cooking,” he says. “There are just a lot more delicious food trucks out there now.”",https://fastcompanyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Branded-entertainment-will-just--scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 03:59:36.882686

BMO Capital downgraded Adobe from Outperform to Market Perform, citing increased competition in the creative market, particularly impacting smaller businesses, students, and freelancers.
Similarly, Jefferies downgraded Adobe from Buy to Hold due to competitive pressures from AI-enhanced alternatives targeting casual users.
KeyBanc also downgraded Adobe to Underweight, setting a price target of $310, following the company’s recent earnings report.
Additionally, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $400 while maintaining an Outperform rating, acknowledging Adobe’s better-than-expected revenue performance.","Investing.com - Goldman Sachs has downgraded to a Sell rating from Buy, setting a price target of $290.00, which represents a potential 14% downside. This target stands in contrast to InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment, which suggests Adobe may be undervalued at its current price of $333.95. The stock has experienced a 17.73% decline over the past year.

The rating change comes as Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges assumes coverage of the software company, applying a 15x P/E multiple to Adobe’s SNTM (Q5-Q8) earnings, representing approximately a 50% discount to peers with a median P/E multiple of 29x. Adobe currently trades at a P/E ratio of 19.96 with a notably low PEG ratio of 0.56, according to InvestingPro data, which tracks over 1,400 US equities with comprehensive Pro Research Reports.

Goldman Sachs notes that Adobe offers lower revenue growth of 10% NTM compared to peers at 11% and lower EPS growth of 10% NTM versus peers at 18%, justifying the bottom quartile PEG valuation. InvestingPro data confirms Adobe’s revenue growth at 10.53% for the last twelve months, while the company maintains impressive gross profit margins of 89.27%.

The investment bank’s analysis considers a broad comparison group of technology companies with over $100 billion in enterprise value that have similar business models and financial profiles to Adobe and can be valued on GAAP P/E.

Goldman Sachs specifically highlights concerns about potential scenarios where Adobe’s EPS growth could face further pressure if the company increases investments in AI initiatives, or if revenue growth falls below 10% due to reduced pricing leverage amid proliferation of AI tools and increased competitive pressure. Despite these concerns, analysts project Adobe’s EPS to reach $22.69 in fiscal year 2026, suggesting continued profitability.

In other recent news, Adobe has reported strong financial results, surpassing both consensus estimates and its own guidance. The company delivered a solid quarter, with Bernstein noting that Adobe’s performance exceeded expectations, leading to a minor adjustment of its stock price target to $506. Despite these positive results, several investment firms have expressed concerns about competitive pressures affecting Adobe. BMO Capital downgraded Adobe from Outperform to Market Perform, citing increased competition in the creative market, particularly impacting smaller businesses, students, and freelancers. Similarly, Jefferies downgraded Adobe from Buy to Hold due to competitive pressures from AI-enhanced alternatives targeting casual users. KeyBanc also downgraded Adobe to Underweight, setting a price target of $310, following the company’s recent earnings report. Additionally, BMO Capital adjusted its price target to $400 while maintaining an Outperform rating, acknowledging Adobe’s better-than-expected revenue performance. These recent developments highlight the mixed sentiment among analysts regarding Adobe’s future prospects amidst growing market competition.

Functional fabrications For all the hype around fashion at the Olympics, brands are still prioritizing fit, fabric and functionality.","The Winter Olympics and Paralympics will take place from Feb. 6-22 in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. Compared to the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics are typically smaller, largely due to high infrastructure costs and climate restraints. Around 2,900 athletes will compete in 2026, compared to 10,500 athletes in 2024. But the merchandise and marketing opportunities for brands are still massive, considering the buzz around sports, the billions of viewers and the allure of a “Big Four” city like Milan. In fact, partnerships tend to lead to sales; Anta reported a rise in revenue when sponsoring the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. This year, NBC said ad slots for the Winter Olympics sold out with “unprecedented demand,” luring more than 100 new advertisers.

“The Olympics are, hands down, one of the most powerful sports platforms in the world,” Harry Poole, svp at the marketing agency Excel Sports Management, told Modern Retail. Poole started his career representing Olympic athletes before shifting to the marketing side. “When you think about global connectivity and cultural relevance, [the Olympics] is a movement that inspires generations,” Poole said. “And the market for it this year is fantastic, when you think about Milan and fashion and what that means to the world.”

Milan is known for its luxury houses like Prada, its ready-to-wear styles and its quality craftsmanship, especially around leather goods. The city is also home to Milan Fashion Week, as well as the fashion district Quadrilatero della Moda. Aesthetics and design, then, play a major role in this year’s Olympics and Paralympics. For instance, this year’s official victory ceremony uniforms stemmed from a contest among three fashion design schools. The new torch design sports a sleek, minimalist look and a larger flame. Even the official motto of the Games is “IT’s your vibe.”

Fashion players, for their part, have spent months hyping up their Olympics products and partnerships. Per a December press release, Ralph Lauren’s Opening Ceremony uniform for Team U.S.A. includes a “statement winter-white wool coat,” while its Closing Ceremony uniform “draws inspiration from vintage ski racing kits.” “We look forward to … bringing our heritage of sport and style to life at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics,” Patrice Louvet, president of Ralph Lauren, said on an earnings call in November. The company’s nine-part TikTok series around the collection and its athletes has garnered more than a quarter of a million views.

Meanwhile, Lululemon’s uniforms for Canada feature topographic map prints and maple leaf designs. The brand recently posted an Instagram video captioned, “We’re not just from Canada, we’re cut from the cold.” “All of us at Lululemon are incredibly proud to support Team Canada on the world’s largest sporting stage with product designed for athletes, and with athletes,” CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement.

Functional fabrications

For all the hype around fashion at the Olympics, brands are still prioritizing fit, fabric and functionality. After all, wearing an eye-catching uniform at the Olympics and Paralympics is one thing. It’s another to ensure the products are optimized for performance.

Nike, which sponsors the podium for Team U.S.A., will debut its Therma-FIT Air Milano jacket at the Winter Olympics. It has called the jacket “the brand’s most technically engineered garment of its kind.” The jacket allows athletes to regulate their temperature by inflating or deflating air within compartments. “Every detail was engineered to let athletes tune their own comfort and fit,” Amie Achtymichuk, lead apparel development innovator, said in a statement.

Apparel brands are creating distinct technology for non-athletes, too, as the healthcare apparel brand Figs demonstrates. 2026 is the first Winter Olympics that Figs, known for its scrubs, will outfit members of the U.S. medical team, or the medical professionals assisting the athletes. “Our goal is really to give them a podium of their own,” Figs CEO and co-founder Trina Spear told Modern Retail.

Figs first outfitted the U.S. medical team in 2024 at the Summer Olympics in Paris. It will do so again in 2028 at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. But Figs had to make changes this year when it came to developing scrubs, jackets and other gear. It ended up developing a new fabrication, known as FIBREx, that’s optimized for alpine conditions like colder temperatures and wind.

“We’re really leveling up from what we did in Paris,” Spear said. “In Paris, we were mainly inside, in sporting facilities, … [but] for winter, we’re on a ski mountain. We designed and developed really warm and technical products that are also really comfortable. … You need a product that’s going to support you in a 12-hour shift or [allow you to] support an athlete across many hours.”

Meanwhile, Dagsmejan, a sleepwear company, is giving members of the Swiss National Ice Hockey Team pajamas and sleep masks to wear at night. For athletes, proper recovery, especially during sleep, is “as much a part of training as nutrition,” said Dagsmejan CEO Catarina Dahlin. Dahlin developed Dagsmejan with her husband, in consultation with partners like the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. The company says its sleepwear uses breathable, natural fibers and focuses on temperature regulation.

As Dahlin sees it, Dagsmejan’s fabrications are perfect for helping ice hockey players wind down after a stressful day. “The matches often take place quite late, [under] very bright light and [with] high energy,” Dahlin told Modern Retail. “After that, you have to try to unwind and go to bed. But you’re also in a bed you’re not used to, and you may not be able to control the air conditioning. How well you recover really impacts how well you can perform and react when it matters.” Dagsmejan has supported the Swiss National Ice Hockey Team since 2021, and both have posted about the partnership on social media.

A lifestyle play

Not all fashion companies involved with the Olympics are developing technical fabrics for those on the ground in Italy. Companies can activate around the events in multiple ways, including through licensing agreements for gear like hats and sweatshirts. These items allow fans of teams and events to show their spirit — and they help boost sales for brands, too.

Some fashion brands are focusing more on the consumer angle. Chubbies, which makes swim trunks and board shorts, rolled out a lifestyle collection for fans to wear at home. The line — which includes performance polos, hoodies and lined swim trunks — is part of a licensing agreement with Team U.S.A.

Team U.S.A. gave Chubbies design guidelines, but the brand could still present its point of view, Tyde Kaneshiro, senior product manager of special projects at Chubbies, told Modern Retail. Chubbies ended up developing a print modeled after intricate snowflake photography. “In a lot of our seasonal development, we look to the runway for trend and color inspiration,” said Kevin Dopp, Chubbies’s senior design director. “But, in this particular [case], we looked at art as inspiration.”

The final designs have red, white and blue to reflect the colors of Team U.S.A. “It doesn’t look generic and feels very us,” Kaneshiro said. The brand is pairing the pieces with a humorous marketing campaign. An Instagram video shows a model in a studio, pretending to ski, while getting “fake snow thrown at him” from a fan, said Ashley Spencer, director of marketing at Chubbies. “We’re championing the vibe of the Olympics in a Chubbies-spun way,” she added.

Also in January, J.Crew rolled out a lifestyle collection with U.S. Ski & Snowboard as part of a partnership that will last three years. The pieces include knitwear, shirts and accessories for women, men and kids. “Our inaugural collection underscores J.Crew’s ability to connect timeless American style with the cultural significance of sport on a global stage,” chairman Kevin Ulrich said in a statement. J.Crew’s marketing campaign around the collection features pro athletes throwing snowballs and relaxing on chaise lounges.

Meanwhile, Skims released the fourth iteration of its official Team U.S.A. capsule, complete with loungewear, sleepwear and intimates. Per Skims, the collection has “rest and recovery in mind” and features “graphics that take their cues from team uniforms.” “It’s comfortable, functional and captures the pride I feel in representing Team U.S.A.,” Olympian Madison Chock said in a statement.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/J-Crew-Ski.png,N,,2026-01-12 01:59:45.549934

On Friday, Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced a bill aimed at curbing government employees involvement in politically-related event contracts.","Prediction markets let people wager on anything from a basketball game to the outcome of a presidential election — and recently, the downfall of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The latter is drawing renewed scrutiny into this murky world of speculative, 24/7 transactions. Last week, an anonymous trader pocketed more than $400,000 after betting that Maduro would soon be out of office.

The bulk of the trader’s bids on the platform Polymarket were made mere hours before President Donald Trump announced the surprise nighttime raid that led to Maduro’s capture, fueling online suspicions of potential insider trading because of the timing of the wagers and the trader’s narrow activity on the platform. Others argued that the risk of getting caught was too big, and that previous speculation about Maduro’s future could have led to such transactions.

Polymarket did not respond to requests for comment.

The commercial use of prediction markets has skyrocketed in recent years, opening the door for people to wage their money on the likelihood of a growing list of future events. But despite some eye-catching windfalls, traders still lose money everyday. And in terms of government oversight in the U.S., the trades are categorized differently than traditional forms of gambling — raising questions about transparency and risk.

Here's what we know:

How prediction markets work

The scope of topics involved in prediction markets can range immensely — from escalation in geopolitical conflicts, to pop culture moments and even the fate of conspiracy theories. Recently, there’s been a surge of wages on elections and sports games. But some users have also bet millions on things like a rumored — and ultimately unrealized — “secret finale” for the Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” whether the U.S. government will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life and how much billionaire Elon Musk might post on social media this month.

In industry-speak, what someone buys or sells in a prediction market is called an “event contract.” They're typically advertised as “yes” or “no” wagers. And the price of one fluctuates between $0 and $1, reflecting what traders are collectively willing to pay based on a 0% to 100% chance of whether they think an event will occur.

The more likely traders think an event will occur, the more expensive that contract will become. And as those odds change over time, users can cash out early to make incremental profits, or try to avoid higher losses on what they’ve already invested.

Proponents of prediction markets argue putting money on the line leads to better forecasts. Experts like Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University, think there’s value in monitoring these platforms for potential news — pointing to prediction markets’ past success with some election outcomes, including the 2024 presidential race.

Still, it's never a “crystal ball,” he noted, and prediction markets can be wrong, too.

Who is behind all of the trading is also pretty murky. While the companies running the platforms collect personal information of their users in order to verify identities and payments, most people can trade under anonymous pseudonyms online — making it difficult for the public to know who is profiting off many event contracts. In theory, people investing their money may be closely following certain events, but others could just be randomly guessing.

Critics stress that the ease and speed of joining these 24/7 wagers leads to financial losses everyday, particularly harming users who may already struggle with gambling. The space also broadens possibilities for potential insider trading.

The major players

Polymarket is one of the largest prediction markets in the world, where its users can fund event contracts through cryptocurrency, debit or credit cards and bank transfers.

Restrictions vary by country, but in the U.S., the reach of these markets has expanded rapidly over recent years, coinciding with shifting policies out of Washington. Former President Joe Biden was aggressive in cracking down on prediction markets and following a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket was barred from operating in the country.

That changed under Trump late last year, when Polymarket announced it would be returning to the U.S. after receiving clearance from the commission. American-based users can now join a platform “waitlist.”

Meanwhile, Polymarket’s top competitor, Kalshi, has been a federally-regulated exchange since 2020. The platform offers similar ways to buy and sell event contracts as Polymarket — and it currently allows event contracts on elections and sports nationwide. Kalshi won court approval just weeks before the 2024 election to let Americans put money on upcoming political races and began to host sports trading about a year ago.

The space is now crowded with other big names. Sports betting giants DraftKings and FanDuel both launched prediction platforms last month. Online broker Robinhood is widening its own offerings. Trump’s social media site Truth Social has also promised to offer an in-platform prediction market through a partnership with Crypto.com — and one of the president’s sons, Donald Trump Jr., holds advisory roles at both Polymarket and Kalshi.

“The train has left the station on these event contracts, they’re not going away,” said Melinda Roth, a visiting associate professor at Washington and Lee University’s School of Law.

Loose regulation

Because they’re positioned as selling event contracts, prediction markets are regulated by the CFTC. That means they can avoid state-level restrictions or bans in place for traditional gambling and sports betting today.

“It’s a huge loophole,” said Karl Lockhart, an assistant professor of law at DePaul University who has studied this space. “You just have to comply with one set of regulations, rather than (rules from) each state around the country.”

Sports betting is taking center stage. There are a handful of big states — like California and Texas, for example — where sports betting is still illegal, but people can now wager on games, athlete trades and more through event contracts.

A growing number of states and tribes are suing to stop this. And lawyers expect litigation to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, as added regulations from the Trump administration seem unlikely.

Federal law bars event contracts related to gaming as well as war, terrorism and assassinations, Roth said, which could put some prediction market trades on shaky ground, at least in the U.S. But users might still find ways to buy certain contracts while traveling abroad or connecting to different VPNs.

Whether the CFTC will take any of that on has yet to be seen. But the agency, which did not respond to request for comment, has already taken steps away from enforcement.

Despite overseeing trillions of dollars for the overall U.S. derivatives market, the CFTC is also much smaller than the Securities and Exchange Commission. And at the same time event contracts are growing rapidly on prediction market platforms, there have been additional cuts to the CFTC's workforce and a wave of leadership departures under Trump's second term. Only one of five commissioner slots operating the agency is currently filled.

Still, other lawmakers calling for a stronger crack down on potential insider trading in prediction markets — particularly following suspicion around last week’s Maduro trade on Polymarket. On Friday, Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced a bill aimed at curbing government employees involvement in politically-related event contracts.

The bill has already gotten support from Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour — who on LinkedIn maintained that insider trading has always been banned on his company's platform but that more needs to be done to crack down on unregulated prediction markets.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/853e1c3a-51b0-4ebc-8d31-fa95c3a84824/20260111T141504/853e1c3a-51b0-4ebc-8d31-fa95c3a84824.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 02:58:24.764158

Stolt-Nielsen is a Norwegian business executive serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors at Stolt-Nielsen Limited, a global transportation and logistics company specializing in chemicals, gases, and aquaculture, since September 2023.[1] He previously held the position of Chief Executive Officer at the company from 2000 to 2023, overseeing its expansion and strategic initiatives in maritime and related sectors.[1] A graduate of Hofstra University with a BS in Business and Finance from 1990, Stolt-Nielsen joined the Stolt-Nielsen organization in 1990, initially working in Greenwich, Connecticut, before relocating to Shanghai in 1994 to establish the company's representative office there.[1] Stolt-Nielsen's career trajectory within the family-founded enterprise includes pivotal roles such as President of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000 and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Stolt Offshore S.A. from September 2002 to March 2003, during which he navigated key operational and market challenges in the offshore energy sector.[1] Beyond Stolt-Nielsen Limited, where he has been a Director since 1996, he currently chairs the Board of Avenir LNG Limited, a joint venture focused on small-scale LNG distribution, and serves as a Director at Golar LNG Limited, a leading provider of LNG infrastructure and shipping solutions.[1][2] His leadership has been instrumental in fostering long-term value creation, including growth into sustainable energy and aquaculture ventures.[3] As a member of the Audit and Compensation Committees at Stolt-Nielsen Limited, he continues to influence governance and strategic oversight in the maritime industry.[1]

Early life and education

Family background

Niels Gregers Stolt-Nielsen was born on January 23, 1965, in Norway. He is the son of Jacob Stolt-Nielsen (1931–2015), who founded Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1959 as a pioneering venture in specialized shipping.[4] The Stolt-Nielsen family traces its heritage to third-generation shipownership in Norway, with roots in Haugesund where Jacob grew up immersed in maritime activities, including running the family herring business as a teenager.[4] The family has played a pivotal role in global shipping, particularly through innovations in parcel tankers designed for safe transport of bulk liquids such as chemicals and edible oils, establishing industry standards without venturing into general cargo operations.[4] Raised in this influential shipping dynasty, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen experienced early exposure to the family business environment, shaped by Norway's coastal heritage and the harbor views that inspired generations of Stolt-Nielsens. The family continues to hold a controlling interest in Stolt-Nielsen Limited, underscoring their enduring legacy in the sector.[4]

Academic pursuits

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen pursued his higher education in the United States, enrolling at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. He graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Business and Finance.[1][5] His choice to study in the United States, far from his native Norway, reflected the international orientation of his family's shipping legacy, providing exposure to a dynamic business environment centered in New York.[4]

Career at Stolt-Nielsen Limited

Initial roles and international expansion

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen joined Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1990, immediately after graduating from Hofstra University with a BS in Business and Finance, beginning his career as a shipbroker at the company's office in Greenwich, Connecticut.[1] In this initial role, he focused on chartering and brokerage activities within the bulk liquid transportation sector, leveraging his finance background to support Stolt Tankers' operations in the U.S. market.[1] By the early 1990s, Stolt-Nielsen advanced to the position of round-voyage manager, where he oversaw the planning and execution of shipping routes for chemical and product tankers, contributing to operational efficiency amid growing global trade demands. This progression highlighted his early aptitude for logistics coordination, setting the stage for broader international responsibilities.[6] In 1994, Stolt-Nielsen played a pivotal role in the company's international expansion by relocating to China to establish and lead Stolt-Nielsen Limited's first representative office in Shanghai.[1] This initiative marked a strategic entry into the Asian market, facilitating local partnerships and market intelligence for Stolt Tankers' growing presence in the region, which was undergoing rapid economic liberalization.[7] His efforts in organizing the office underscored the company's commitment to global outreach during a period of increasing demand for specialized shipping services in emerging economies. Stolt-Nielsen's contributions culminated in his appointment as a director of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in 1996, where he began overseeing initial ventures into aquaculture, including the leadership of Stolt Sea Farm as its president from 1996 to 2000.[1] This role involved directing early salmon farming operations, integrating his shipping expertise with new diversification strategies in sustainable seafood production.[6] These steps not only expanded the company's portfolio but also positioned Stolt-Nielsen as a key figure in bridging maritime logistics with innovative agribusiness.[7]

CEO leadership and strategic shifts

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in November 2000, succeeding his father, Jacob Stolt-Nielsen, who had led the company since its founding in 1959.[3] Under his leadership, the company prioritized sustainable growth across its core operations in bulk-liquid logistics, including parcel tankers for chemicals and edible oils, bulk-liquid storage terminals, tank containers, and land-based aquaculture through Stolt Sea Farm.[1] This approach focused on optimizing performance, expanding asset bases, and enhancing market positions to deliver consistent financial results amid fluctuating market cycles.[8] During his tenure, Stolt-Nielsen held additional key roles that underscored his executive oversight. He served as President of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000, guiding the aquaculture division's development prior to his CEO appointment.[1] From October 2002 to March 2003, he acted as Interim Chief Executive Officer of Stolt Offshore S.A., a subsea construction and maintenance subsidiary, during a transitional period for that business.[9] These positions highlighted his hands-on involvement in diversifying and stabilizing the group's operations beyond traditional shipping.[1] A significant strategic shift under Stolt-Nielsen's leadership was the expansion into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and broader gas sectors, aligning with the company's expertise in liquid logistics and the global energy transition.[8] Through Stolt-Nielsen Gas, established as an investment arm during his tenure, the company acquired stakes in LNG infrastructure and shipping, including a controlling interest in Avenir LNG Limited, which operates a fleet of small-scale LNG carriers and bunkering vessels.[10] This diversification strengthened the portfolio's resilience, with investments in LNG storage terminals and related technologies contributing to long-term value creation despite market volatility in the sector.[8]

Transition to chairman

In January 2022, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen announced his intention to step down as Chief Executive Officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited after serving in the role since November 2000, citing the desire to introduce fresh leadership to guide the company's future.[3] He emphasized that the timing allowed the board sufficient opportunity to identify and appoint a successor while ensuring a smooth transition, reflecting his commitment to the company's ongoing success.[3] Stolt-Nielsen, who first joined the company in 1990, noted in the announcement that leading Stolt-Nielsen Limited had been a privilege, underscoring his dedication to its operations over more than three decades.[3] The succession process culminated in August 2023 with the appointment of Udo Lange as the new CEO, effective September 1, 2023.[11] Lange brought over 20 years of experience in international trade, including senior roles at FedEx Express where he led global operations in logistics and supply chain management across multiple continents.[11] This transition marked the end of Stolt-Nielsen's 23-year tenure as CEO, during which he had focused on long-term value creation in the shipping and logistics sectors.[11] Upon stepping down as CEO, Stolt-Nielsen assumed the position of Chairman of the Board of Stolt-Nielsen Limited in September 2023, subject to shareholder approval, and also joined the Audit and Compensation Committees.[1] In this new role, he continued to contribute to the company's strategic oversight, building on his extensive history since 1990 in fostering sustainable growth within the specialized shipping and related industries.[1]

Other business positions

Founding and leadership at Avance Gas

In 2007, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen founded Avance Gas AS to enter the burgeoning market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, establishing it as a specialized provider of very large gas carriers (VLGCs) capable of transporting LPG across global trade routes.[12][13] Stolt-Nielsen has served as Chairman of Avance Gas since its inception, steering the company through phases of strategic expansion in the energy shipping sector. Under his leadership, Avance Gas grew from a startup to a prominent operator, leveraging long-term charter contracts to ensure stable revenue amid volatile shipping markets.[12] Key achievements during his tenure include the fleet expansion through an orderbook of eight newbuildings announced in 2014, with deliveries increasing the fleet to 14 VLGCs by the end of 2015, which enabled Avance Gas to capture a significant share of the international LPG trade, particularly in routes connecting the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. This positioning capitalized on rising global demand for LPG as a cleaner fuel alternative, with the company's vessels achieving high utilization rates and contributing to efficient supply chain logistics for petrochemical feedstocks. By 2024, Avance Gas had established itself as a leading independent owner in the VLGC segment before the sale of its fleet to BW LPG.[13][14][15] In 2024, Avance Gas sold its fleet of 12 VLGCs to BW LPG for approximately $1.05 billion, completing Stolt-Nielsen's divestment from the company.[15]

Roles in LNG and related sectors

Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen has served as a director of Golar LNG Limited since September 2015, where he contributes to the company's advancements in floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) technology and LNG carrier operations.[5] Under his board tenure, Golar has pioneered FLNG units like the Hilli Episeyo, the world's first converted FLNG vessel, which began production off Cameroon in 2018, enhancing efficient LNG liquefaction and export capabilities. His involvement aligns with Golar's strategic expansions in modular FLNG solutions, supporting global energy supply chains.[5] As Chairman of the Board of Avenir LNG Limited since October 2018, Stolt-Nielsen has guided the company's growth in small-scale LNG distribution and infrastructure development.[2] Avenir, in which Stolt-Nielsen Limited holds a majority stake, focuses on bunkering, trucking, and regasification solutions to deliver LNG to remote and industrial markets, including investments in small-scale carriers and storage terminals.[16] His leadership has supported Avenir's growth, including the expansion of its fleet of small-scale LNG carriers, with 5 vessels in operation and additional newbuildings on order by 2023, facilitating LNG as a transitional fuel for maritime and land-based applications.[17] Stolt-Nielsen's board capacities extend to related sustainable energy initiatives, such as his past presidency of Stolt Sea Farm from 1996 to 2000, where aquaculture operations emphasized environmentally responsible practices that complement broader energy transition goals.[18] Since the 2010s, his strategic oversight across these LNG entities has promoted the adoption of cleaner fuels in shipping, including dual-fuel vessels and LNG bunkering infrastructure to reduce emissions in line with IMO regulations.[19] This work builds complementarily on his experience in gas carrier operations at Avance Gas.

Tax residency dispute

Emigration to London

In late December 2001, Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen notified Norwegian authorities of his relocation to London, England, on December 1, 2001, where he established his primary residence.[20] This move, over a year after he had become chief executive officer of Stolt-Nielsen Limited (SNL), a global shipping company headquartered in London, reflected the demands of his CEO position that required extensive international travel and oversight of operations across multiple countries.[3] The emigration was driven by professional necessities tied to SNL's worldwide activities, including frequent business engagements in the UK that necessitated a London base to facilitate efficient management and decision-making. As a result of the notification, Stolt-Nielsen ceased making tax payments to Norway, aligning his tax residency with his new circumstances in England. His lifestyle adjustments, such as maintaining a presence in London for both work and personal reasons, supported this shift away from Norwegian tax obligations.[21][22] Norwegian authorities initially accepted Stolt-Nielsen's claimed foreign residency for the tax years 2002 through 2004 due to a clerical error in processing at the Oslo tax office, which led to no Norwegian tax assessments being issued during this period. This provisional acceptance provided temporary relief from Norwegian taxation, though it stemmed from administrative oversight rather than a formal determination of residency status.[23][22]

Legal challenges and outcomes

In 2005, Norwegian tax authorities discovered a clerical error in their prior assessments of Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen's residency status, which had initially accepted his 2001 emigration notification to London for the years 2002–2004. This prompted the Oslo Tax Office to claim back taxes for the period 2001–2005, asserting that he maintained permanent residence in Frogner, Oslo, due to strong personal and familial ties to Norway.[22][23][24] Stolt-Nielsen responded by filing a lawsuit against the Norwegian Tax Administration, seeking to overturn the revised tax assessments and affirm his primary residency in London, where he conducted most of his professional and personal life. He argued that his time spent in Norway was limited and incidental, primarily for family visits and obligations, and that his center of vital interests had shifted abroad following the 2001 move.[22][25][23] In November 2007, the Oslo District Court ruled against Stolt-Nielsen on all counts, upholding the tax authorities' position that his permanent residence remained in Oslo based on factors such as ownership of a family home in Frogner, a country estate, vehicles registered in Norway, significant time spent in the country, and ongoing familial connections. The court determined that these elements demonstrated insufficient detachment from Norway to qualify as a tax emigrant, resulting in upheld tax liabilities for 2001 and 2005. Stolt-Nielsen was also ordered to cover his own legal costs of 474,000 Norwegian kroner and the state's costs of 95,000 Norwegian kroner.[22][23][26] Stolt-Nielsen appealed the decision. In December 2009, the Norwegian Supreme Court (HR-2009-2323-A) granted him partial relief by overturning the 2005 tax assessment, ruling that a declaration from UK tax authorities established his tax residency in the United Kingdom for that year under the Norway-UK tax treaty. The 2001 assessment remained upheld.[20][27]

Later developments

As of February 2023, Stolt-Nielsen relocated his tax residency from Bermuda back to Norway, citing anticipated large incomes and more favorable tax conditions in Norway compared to Bermuda.[28]",https://grokipedia.com/icon-512x512.png,N,,2026-01-12 13:05:02.561558

Havas Media Parent company Havas has been on an acquisitive streak of late but its media arm remains smaller than its holdco counterparts.
What remains to be seen is how Havas Media fares with its new joint venture with Horizon Media.
WPP Media Sports is a new practice charged with creating sponsorships, content and integrations, with GumGum and Relo Metrics as partners.","Comvergence, which hits 10 years in operation this year, has become the gold standard of measuring agencies’ success (or lack of). However, the data Digiday is citing here is only provisional. As Comvergence’s founder and CEO Olivier Gauthier explained, the data doesn’t include wins and losses not publicly announced — that final report will be issued in February, once Comvergence connects with all the agencies it tracks. (Although Gauthier acknowledges that the numbers don’t change on average more than 5% or so.)

Back to the numbers themselves. Somewhat surprising is what happened in between Publicis and WPP Media. Dentsu, it turns out, had a solid year, ending 2025 up $1.7 billion (details by holdco below), which technically puts it in second place for the year. But the gap between No.’s 1 and 2 — $9.5 billion to $1.7 billion, is cavernous to say the least.

Another surprise is third-place finisher IPG’s Mediabrands, which yielded a positive $1.6 billion, and placing it ahead of Omnicom Media, which ended 2025 up $1.2 billion — and yet Omnicom was the acquirer of IPG. If you put them together, they’d tally $2.8 billion in wins, ahead of Dentsu but still a distant second to Publicis.

Here’s a breakdown by holdco, ranked in order of total business won.

Publicis Media

It’s no secret the French holdco has been on a tear, winning Mars, Coca-Cola, Paramount, PayPal and most recently Kenvue, demolishing the competition. More importantly, it’s retained 50% of its business, according to Comvergence’s provisional totals, more than any other holdco. It lost just over $1.5 billion in media business.

Dentsu

Even though Dentsu outside of the Japanese mothership is informally on the block, it had a decent year. Although it won $1.8 billion in new business, it lost almost as much — which means its strength came from successful retention, which amounted to some $1.6 billion. Observers will be watching closely to see what happens to the former Aegis agencies that are seemingly up in the air.

IPG Mediabrands

“It’s very interesting that Mediabrands had a very good year in the U.S.,” said Gauthier. Most would agree with that sentiment, given that IPG was the acquisition target all year. It pulled in $2.4 billion in new business, but lost $1.9 billion, leaving it at a net of under $500 million — once again, successful defense helped win the day as Mediabrands held onto $1.1 billion it had to defend.

Omnicom Media

Omnicom Media really didn’t have a good year at all, which is perhaps the biggest surprise of the numbers. It’s only thanks to WPP Media’s truly awful year that distracted from this reality. Not counting retention, Omnicom Media came out just under $700 million ahead ($3 billion in wins vs. $2.3 billion in losses). To make matters worse, its retention rate was a wan 17% according to the Comvergence data, the second worse among the holdcos. It’s safe to say 2026 will be a different story as the absorption of IPG takes root — whether it’s a better or worse story remains to be seen.

Havas Media

Parent company Havas has been on an acquisitive streak of late but its media arm remains smaller than its holdco counterparts. Havas Media secured $1.4 billion in wins, lost $750 million and retained $350 million. According to Comvergence’s tallies, its retention rate was a middle-of-the-road 32%. What remains to be seen is how Havas Media fares with its new joint venture with Horizon Media. The pairing is complementary on paper, with Havas weak in the U.S. but well represented globally, and the opposite for Horizon. Gauthier said Comvergence will create a new category for that JV once it’s up and running this year.

WPP Media

And finally, WPP Media remained the punching bag of the holdcos, and with some good reason — ending the year $2 billion in the negative ($3.3 billion in wins, $6.4 billion in losses and successfully retaining only $1 billion). All that said, it’s worth noting that the Cindy Rose era of WPP was in its infancy for Q4, which is when WPP Media landed big-ticket accounts such as the U.K. government and Jaguar Land Rover (both from Omnicom). It’s also shoring up its client-side team by hiring away Angela Steele from Publicis (no easy feat to lure an exec away from the No. 1 holdco) where she had been CEO of Publicis Collective and in charge of the Verizon account. This year could bring better fortunes to the beleaguered London-based holdco.

Color by numbers

Since you’ve just had to absorb a LOT of numbers in the main story, here are two eye-popping stats that Comvergence’s Gauthier mentioned in relation to the holding companies. Together they were involved in more than 1,900 pitches across 50 countries last year, which totaled something in the neighborhood of $28 billion.

Takeoff & landing

At CES, Havas announced it will launch this spring an LLM portal called AVA, which will centralize the holdco’s access to major LLMs including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3.

Both WPP Media and Stagwell made moves in the sports arena. WPP Media Sports is a new practice charged with creating sponsorships, content and integrations, with GumGum and Relo Metrics as partners. And Stagwell, which has put on Sports Beach as a Cannes Lions activation for a few years, made it into its own marketing business unit, with multiple events scheduled over the course of 2026. Beth Sidhu, who is also Stagwell’s chief brand and communications officer, was named CEO.

Horizon Media said it will incorporate Sightly’s Brand Mentality and Model Context Protocol tools into its Blu market intelligence platform.

PMG acquired London and New York-based Digital Voices, an influencer marketing agency, in a bid to beef up its influencer and creator resources.

Independent Novus tapped Libby Morgan to be its new CEO, coming over from Merge where she was chief digital officer. Morgan replaces Melony Rios.

Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker – who worked at Allegiant before making the move to Minnesota – will only join the airline's board and serve in an advisory capacity.
In the short term, both Allegiant and Sun Country said there would be no immediate changes to upcoming Sun Country tickets, schedules, or its onboard experience.
Leaders from Sun Country and Allegiant were expected to address the proposed merger Monday morning.
Case in point: After a four-year run, Allegiant exited Minneapolis entirely just last year.","Ultra-low-cost carrier Allegiant Air announced plans Sunday to acquire Minnesota’s Sun Country Airlines in a $1.5 billion transaction, swallowing up a smaller budget airline in a move that could have major ramifications for Minnesota travelers on the hunt for bargain airfare.

The proposed merger would fold Sun Country's planes, pilots, and crews all under Allegiant's umbrella, creating one bigger budget carrier – though it would still be significantly smaller than either Spirit or Frontier, according to airline data. With a deal expected to close sometime in the second half of 2026, the combined airline would continue under Allegiant's name with its headquarters in Las Vegas.

Allegiant said it would maintain a “significant presence” in Sun Country's Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) hub after the deal closes. But a long history of airline mergers suggests that there could be reductions in Minneapolis down the road. Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker – who worked at Allegiant before making the move to Minnesota – will only join the airline's board and serve in an advisory capacity.

In the short term, both Allegiant and Sun Country said there would be no immediate changes to upcoming Sun Country tickets, schedules, or its onboard experience. Translation? Don't worry if you're booked to fly with Sun Country in the weeks and months ahead.

The deal will require approval from President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which has taken a friendlier approach to consolidation than the Biden administration that blocked several airline deals, including JetBlue's proposed takeover of Spirit Airlines. And unlike many previous mergers, Sun Country and Allegiant are both relatively small and barely overlap today, meaning regulators may see less cause for concern than other takeover attempts.

Leaders from Sun Country and Allegiant were expected to address the proposed merger Monday morning.

“This combination is an exciting next chapter in Allegiant and Sun Country’s shared mission in providing affordable, reliable, and convenient service from underserved communities to premier leisure destinations,” Allegiant CEO Gregory Anderson said in a written statement.

This merger is just the latest sign of turbulence in the U.S.'s low-cost carrier market, which has fallen out of favor in the post-pandemic travel boom. Spirit Airlines is in its second round of bankruptcy proceedings and yet another run of the rumor mill about an acquisition by Frontier.

Sun Country has been far more successful, posting profits for years as it challenged Delta's dominance in Minneapolis while branching out into flying packages for Amazon and ferrying college football teams and professional soccer squads across the country.

Sunday's surprise merger announcement could change everything.

What Allegiant's Acquisition Means for Minneapolis

If the merger moves ahead, it'll be the end of Sun Country in name: an airline with a storied yet often complicated brand.

Sun Country has been a household name in Minnesota for decades after starting up service in 1982 in the wake of Braniff International's collapse. After years of financial struggles operating as a beloved full-service hometown carrier, the airline began an unpopular transition to a low-cost model before the pandemic – complete with fees for everything from bags to seat assignments to buying your tickets at the airport and installed smaller seats, to boot. Its reputation took a major blow after stranding hundreds of passengers in Mexico in April 2018 … and never fully recovered.

Yet Sun Country prided itself on being a different kind of low-cost carrier. While it ripped out first class seats and shrank legroom throughout the cabin, its seating was better padded than the ultra-slimline seats that Frontier, Spirit, and even Allegiant use on their planes. Even as those competitors charged for water, Sun Country served free soft drinks and sold snacks and craft beers with a Minnesota flair.

As the rest of the budget airline industry struggled with higher costs and dipping demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, Sun Country grew fast, going public in 2021 and challenging Delta's dominance in Minneapolis. It turned the airport into what its CEO dubbed “a two-airline market.” Most importantly, Sun Country's $89 one-way fares have given Minnesota travelers a cheaper alternative to Delta's pricier fares but also forced the Atlanta-based airline to compete on price, bringing fares down across the board.

That's what could be at stake with this proposed merger. While they might both be budget airlines in name, they're drastically different in practice.

Overnight, complimentary drinks could disappear and over time, Sun Country's more comfortable seating could disappear, too. But bigger picture, the changes could be even more drastic.

When airlines buy one another, what they're really looking to buy is planes and pilots to fuel future growth. While Sun Country has been all-in on Minneapolis for decades, Allegiant focuses on operating flights between smaller airports all across the country – routes where it can have a monopoly and charge higher fares.

Even with the Sun Country name gone, Allegiant says it would maintain a significant presence in Minneapolis – it called the airport an “Important Base of Operations and Key Anchor City” in its press release announcing the merger. But what if Allegiant eventually decides to give up the fight against Delta and instead fly those planes between Las Vegas or southern Florida and other, smaller airports?

Aside from planes and people, the biggest win for Allegiant is swallowing up Sun Country's international service down to Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America – service Allegiant has lacked. But again, what if Allegiant decides it's better to fly down to the beach from St. Petersburg (PIE) rather than Minneapolis-St. Paul?

Sun Country has relished its role as a scrappy (and cheaper) alternative to Delta. Allegiant's entire identity is built around avoiding competition altogether. Case in point: After a four-year run, Allegiant exited Minneapolis entirely just last year.

Bricker, Sun Country's CEO for nearly a decade, won't play a large role once the transaction clears. He'll join the combined carriers' board of directors but only serve in a day-to-day advisory role to Allegiant's current CEO “to help ensure a smooth and successful integration.”

Allegiant also indicated it will continue Sun Country's cargo operations on behalf of Amazon – a major upside for the Minnesota airline the last few years as travel demand has plateaued.

· The global container ship orderbook currently stands at 26–28% of the existing fleet, one of the highest levels seen in more than a decade.
· Average global spot freight rates are expected to decline by up to 25% year-on-year, while long-term contract rates may fall by 8–12% as shippers regain negotiating leverage.
· Container shipping fundamentals are likely to deteriorate further due to oversupply, easing port congestion, and the potential return of vessels to Suez Canal routings, which would release additional effective capacity.

“While freight rates are expected to normalize sharply from recent highs, the industry is unlikely to return to pre-crisis stability due to persistent geopolitical, regulatory, and environmental risks,” says Supal Shah, CEO of Sarjak Container Lines. “2026 will bring relief on rates, but not certainty. Oversupply is structural, costs are permanently higher, and volatility is now a feature, not a phase, of global shipping.”

Key takeaways:

· Global fleet capacity is projected to grow by 3.6%–5% in 2026, significantly outpacing demand growth of 1.5%–3%, according to industry forecasts.

· The global container ship orderbook currently stands at 26–28% of the existing fleet, one of the highest levels seen in more than a decade.

· Average global spot freight rates are expected to decline by up to 25% year-on-year, while long-term contract rates may fall by 8–12% as shippers regain negotiating leverage.

· Industry-wide profitability is expected to weaken materially, with several analysts forecasting losses of up to USD 10 billion in 2026, driven by falling revenues and structurally higher operating costs.

· Container shipping fundamentals are likely to deteriorate further due to oversupply, easing port congestion, and the potential return of vessels to Suez Canal routings, which would release additional effective capacity.

· The dry bulk sector is expected to remain weak but stable, with potential upside if global trade volumes recover or geopolitical tensions ease.

· A broad return to Suez Canal transits could reduce effective global vessel demand by up to 10%, as shorter voyages free up capacity.

· Rising trade protectionism, evolving U.S. tariff regimes, and shifting supply chains remain key uncertainties that could disrupt established trade lanes and dampen demand for higher-margin cargo.

· Effective Jan. 1, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) moves to 100% emissions compliance, adding permanent cost structures to Europe-linked trade lanes and accelerating cost pass-through to shippers.

· Shippers are increasingly adopting continuous rate governance, real-time pricing analytics, and AI-driven procurement tools, moving away from rigid annual contracting cycles.

· Vessel owners are prioritizing lifecycle optimization, fuel flexibility, including LNG, methanol, and biofuels, and energy-efficiency investments to meet tightening decarbonization targets while preserving asset competitiveness.

“While 2026 is expected to bring lower freight rates and improved cost visibility for shippers, the global shipping industry remains structurally fragile. Oversupply, regulatory costs, and geopolitical uncertainty will continue to define a market that is less crisis-driven, but far from stable,” says Shah.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2026/01/melita-stockadobecom.Aimb2rqJ4U.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-12 03:59:04.876406

While the 2025 Braves weren’t good, Johnson made 45 of his 65 appearances in high-leverage spots.","In 2025, as good as Emilio Pagán and Tony Santillan were in the back of the Reds’ bullpen, the middle relief core for most of the season included pitchers who weren’t incredibly consistent, guys in their first year as a relief pitcher and rookies.

Heading into 2026, Nick Krall and the Reds’ front office made solidifying the middle relief depth in the bullpen a priority. After bringing Pagán to close and signing lefty Caleb Ferguson in December, the Reds made another notable move on Sunday by agreeing to a deal with veteran reliever Pierce Johnson, according to sources.

The deal between the Reds and Johnson was first reported by the New York Post. The terms aren’t yet known.

For a while, we’ve all been wondering when the Reds would finally add that impact bat, or even replace Austin Hays and Miguel Andujar. But the front office’s focus has clearly been on the bullpen.

“We had four guys we lost in the bullpen in Pagán (re-signed), Nick Martinez, Brent Suter and Scott Barlow,” Krall said a few weeks ago. “When you look at the guys we lost, it’s something we had to continue to solidify.”

The back of the Reds’ bullpen was great last season, but the middle relief core had its rough patches.

Graham Ashcraft had a fine year as the seventh-inning guy as he made the transition to the bullpen, but he was on the injured list twice and finished the season with a 3.99 ERA. Scott Barlow was more of a workhorse than a late-game weapon. Lyon Richardson, Luis Mey and Connor Phillips got their chances to pitch high-leverage innings, and only Phillips stuck. Nick Martinez, Chase Burns and Phillips took the bullpen up a level in September, but Martinez is a free agent right now, Chase Burns is going back to the rotation and Phillips is still inexperienced.

The Reds’ bullpen looks pretty set right now. The leverage guys are Pagán, Santillan, Johnson, Ashcraft and Ferguson (the lefty). The Reds guaranteed money to Moll back in November, and it’s always good to have a second lefty. Phillips put himself in a great position to break camp with the big league club with how good he looked down the stretch last season.

That could lead to a competition for the final spot between Zach Maxwell, Luis Mey, Yosver Zulueta, Richardson (no longer on the 40-man but still in the organization) and non-roster invitees like Josh Staumont.

Before signing Johnson, the Reds didn’t have a right-handed middle relief veteran in the mold of Barlow, Martinez, Buck Farmer or Fernando Cruz. While those relievers had different levels of ability and upside, you could mostly count on them to make 60+ appearances a year. You need a certain level of stability to get you through the season and to keep you from having to regularly restock your bullpen with roster moves to provide fresh arms.

Johnson fits that mold, and he has also proven to be a capable leverage reliever on a good team.

While the 2025 Braves weren’t good, Johnson made 45 of his 65 appearances in high-leverage spots.

On a playoff team in Atlanta in 2024, Johnson was consistently a late-game option in big moments and pitched the eighth inning of a close win-or-go-home postseason game. On a 2023 Braves team that won 104 games, Johnson joined the squad at the trade deadline and quickly became a leverage guy.

It took a bit for Johnson to find his footing in MLB. But once he went all-in on his curveball (he threw more curveballs than any reliever in all of baseball last season and uses the pitch 72% of the time), Johnson leveled up.

Heading into the 2024 season, he re-signed with Atlanta on a two-year deal for $14.25 million. And then he went on to have two seasons that were as good or better than what he had done before. In 2025, Johnson posted career highs (over a full season) in ERA, WAR and many advanced metrics.

Johnson fills up the strike zone, giving the Reds a good combination of durability, reliability and late-game usefulness.

A few weeks ago, after adding outfielders JJ Bleday and Dane Myers, Krall said, “We’ve got some more money to be able to use.” Since then, the Reds freed up a bit of money by DFAing Keegan Thompson ($1.4 million) and by finalizing the salaries of most of their arbitration eligible players (by my estimation that could account for about $1 million of added financial flexibility).

Before the Johnson move, my projections had the Reds at $111 million of payroll for 2026. They were in the $116 million range last season, and 2026 payroll is expected to be pretty close to what it was last season.

A few weeks ago, when asked what the Reds could use their remaining financial flexibility to add this winter, Krall said, “Bullpen depth and some offense.”

Signing Johnson takes care of the bullpen depth. Assuming they still have a bit of financial flexibility (that will become clearer as the terms are known for Johnson), the Reds could be in the market for a first baseman or an outfielder.

In the level of free agency the Reds are working at (they’re not signing Kyle Tucker), bringing back Hays would feel like a win and a great case scenario for them.

First baseman Nathaniel Lowe, Paul Goldschmidt and Rhys Hoskins are free agents.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r1YA!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F77c25d83-f341-4fd7-8b2a-e8e014f85006_1578x886.png",N,,2026-01-11 21:58:34.407073

The company’s leadership in metabolic disease, anchored by its high profile weight loss and diabetes therapies, has reshaped growth expectations while delivering measurable benefits to society. With accelerating earnings, expanding margins, and a robust late stage pipeline, Lilly offers a compelling blend of return potential and real world impact that firmly qualifies it for the Good Stocks universe.

The Return Case

Lilly’s investment appeal rests on a powerful combination of accelerating revenue growth, operating leverage, and exceptional profitability. With profit growth forecast above 100 percent and industry leading margins, earnings momentum remains the central driver of long term shareholder returns.

The Impact Case

Beyond financials, Lilly’s therapies are redefining how obesity and metabolic disease are treated globally. At the same time, strong resource efficiency and high recycling rates reinforce the company’s standing as a responsible operator across its value chain.

Company Profile: A Science First Growth Engine

Eli Lilly is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on diabetes, obesity, oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Its portfolio includes some of the most impactful medicines of the past decade, supported by deep expertise in biologics, peptide chemistry, and large scale manufacturing.

The company’s most visible products today are its GLP 1 based therapies for diabetes and weight management, which have seen unprecedented demand. These medicines address conditions that affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide and are increasingly viewed as foundational treatments rather than niche interventions.

From a market perspective, Lilly operates in therapeutic areas with durable, above average growth. Obesity treatment alone is evolving into one of the largest pharmaceutical markets globally. Lilly’s competitive moat is built on first mover scale, manufacturing capacity, strong clinical data, and a pipeline that extends well beyond its current blockbusters. This combination makes its market position defensible even as competition intensifies.

Financial Analysis: Growth Justifying the Premium

Multi Year Performance and Recent Momentum

Over the past five years, Lilly has delivered steady revenue growth that has recently accelerated sharply. Revenue growth rose from low double digits earlier in the cycle to over 30 percent in the most recent year, with trailing twelve month growth exceeding 45 percent. EBITDA and earnings growth have accelerated even more dramatically, reflecting operating leverage as volumes scale.

Margins tell the same story. EBITDA margins have expanded into the low 40 percent range, while net profit margins now exceed 30 percent on a trailing basis. Returns on equity and assets are among the highest in the pharmaceutical industry, underscoring efficient capital deployment.

Valuation in Context

At first glance, Lilly’s valuation appears demanding. The stock trades at a forward price to earnings multiple in the mid to high 40s, well above the sector average. However, valuation looks more reasonable when set against growth. Earnings per share growth is forecast above 100 percent in the near term, and revenue growth is expected to remain well above the company’s long term average.

Importantly, the growth trajectory is accelerating rather than decelerating. The step change driven by metabolic therapies has not yet fully flowed through earnings, suggesting that near term multiple compression may be offset by rapid earnings expansion.

Growth Drivers and Industry KPIs

Key industry specific indicators support this outlook. Prescription volumes for Lilly’s weight loss and diabetes drugs continue to rise, capacity expansions are coming online, and demand remains supply constrained in several markets. Unlike many pharmaceutical growth stories, this momentum is driven by real world utilization rather than pricing alone.

Analyst Expectations and Upside

Consensus analyst targets imply modest single digit upside from current levels. That may appear conservative, but it reflects the stock’s strong recent performance rather than deteriorating fundamentals. With a Ziggma Score of 88, supported by profitability at 95 and financial health at 97, Lilly remains one of the highest quality profiles in global healthcare.

Risks to the Return Scenario

The primary risks center on competition, pricing pressure, and execution. Rival therapies could narrow Lilly’s market share over time. Regulatory scrutiny around drug pricing may intensify. Manufacturing scale up must continue without disruption. Finally, expectations are high, which increases sensitivity to any earnings disappointment.

Risks to the Return Scenario

If Lilly sustains current growth rates for longer than expected, earnings expansion alone could drive meaningful upside even with stable valuation multiples.

Impact Analysis: Medicines That Change Lives

Tackling Obesity at Scale

Lilly’s weight loss therapies represent one of the most significant medical advances in decades. Obesity is linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and reduced life expectancy. By enabling substantial and sustained weight loss, these drugs have the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve quality of life for millions.

Responsible Resource Use

Beyond patient impact, Lilly scores highly on Sustainable Resource Use, with an especially strong recycling rate that drives its elevated score in this category. Efficient water use and waste management reflect disciplined operational practices that reduce environmental footprint across manufacturing sites.

Investment Thesis: Quality Growth with Real World Impact

Lilly’s investment case is built on three pillars. First, a step change in growth driven by category defining metabolic therapies. Second, best in class profitability and financial strength that allow the company to reinvest at scale. Third, tangible societal benefits that reinforce long term license to operate.

Over the next two to three years, earnings growth is likely to remain the dominant driver of returns. Even if valuation multiples normalize modestly, earnings expansion can support continued share price appreciation. Crucially, this growth is underpinned by products that deliver clear benefits to patients and healthcare systems worldwide.

LLY Is Where Innovation and Impact Reinforce Returns

Eli Lilly exemplifies what a Good Stock should look like. It pairs industry leading growth and profitability with therapies that address some of the most pressing health challenges of our time. While valuation is no longer cheap, the company’s accelerating growth trajectory, operational excellence, and profound societal impact make a compelling case for long term investors seeking both returns and purpose.

After a slow start, Google's AI chatbot is rapidly gaining users, topping AI benchmark leaderboards, and forcing its biggest competitor, OpenAI's ChatGPT, into ""code red"" emergencies.

Now, in another big leap, Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is partnering with Gemini on a new shopping experience — similar to one it struck with ChatGPT in October.

When people use Gemini to ask questions or search, the assistant will now automatically recommend relevant products from Walmart and Sam's Club, drawing on users' past online and in-store purchases, Walmart said in a press release on Sunday.

For users who have linked their Walmart accounts, Gemini can tailor recommendations based on purchase history and enable delivery of in-store items within three hours, or as little as 30 minutes.

Walmart CEO John Furner said the partnership marks a shift in how people shop.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail. We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it,"" Furner said in the press release.

In recent years, discovery-led shopping experiences on social media platforms like TikTok Shop, Instagram Shopping, and live shopping services like Whatnot have disrupted the traditional digital shopping experience.

AI is reshaping the discovery process even further.

Gemini 3 plays catch-up

While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall number of users by a significant margin, it's closing the gap and even outperforming OpenAI in other key ways.

In November, after years of taking heat as the slow-moving leviathan in the AI race, Google redeemed itself with the launch of Gemini 3.

The latest version of Google's chatbot was well received by both consumers and industry leaders. Its stock price surged in the weeks following the rollout, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he would switch from ChatGPT to Gemini, calling the latter ""insane"" in a viral post.

The hype forced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare a ""code red"" at his company.

Gemini also benefits from Google's larger ecosystem of products, like Search, Workplace, Android, and Google TV.

The protocol battle

Another promising development for Gemini, underpinning its partnership with Walmart, is the launch of a new retail protocol, which Google refers to as the Universal Commerce Protocol.

""AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a post on X on Sunday. ""To help lay the groundwork, we partnered with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart to create the Universal Commerce Protocol, a new open standard for agents and systems to talk to each other across every step of the shopping journey.""

Protocols have long served as the invisible scaffolding of the digital realm, and streamlining a new era of agent-to-agent communication is a critical step in unlocking an agent-powered world, founders building AI protocols previously told Business Insider.

OpenAI unveiled its own commerce protocol in September, following the launch of Instant Checkout. The new feature lets users buy items directly in ChatGPT from Etsy and over a million Shopify merchants, the company said in a blog post announcing the feature.

OpenAI also said the protocol behind it, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, is ""an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases."" It was developed alongside Stripe.

Google's mission appears to be similar.

In response to a request for comment, a Google spokesperson referred Business Insider to a blog post Pichai wrote about its new Unified Commerce Protocol.

In it, he explains how the new protocol will change the consumer shopping experience.

He said if a shopper is looking for a suitcase, the protocol allows retailers to instantly offer a new-member price or prompt loyalty enrollment. Returning customers might see tailored discounts or product suggestions, such as packing cubes, when they check out. The transaction can then be completed in just a few taps through Google Pay — without leaving the chat, Pichai said.",https://i.insider.com/69641e5d764ca5f34d2a3c21?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-11 20:58:50.351734

Any shift in capital requirements or banking sector taxes can quickly change the earnings equation for institutions like Société Générale.","Few European bank stocks divide opinion quite as sharply right now as Société Générale. The French lender’s share price has moved only modestly over the past week, but the subdued price action hides a much more polarised debate over capital strength, restructuring risks and how much patience the market still has with management’s long game.

Société Générale S.A. stock: deep dive into valuation, strategy and risks for global investors

On the screen, Société Générale S.A. (ISIN FR0000130809) trades around the mid 20 euro area, according to live quotes from Yahoo Finance and Reuters. Intraday charts show a mostly sideways drift over the last five sessions, with small daily swings rather than the kind of trend that excites momentum traders. The short term sentiment is cautious rather than panicked, a market that is watching and waiting rather than one rushing for the exits.

Across the last five trading days, the stock has oscillated within a relatively narrow band, with closing levels moving only modestly up and down compared with the prior week. There were no dramatic gap moves or outsized volume spikes, and the tape suggests that both buyers and sellers are testing the range rather than forcing a breakout. In other words, price is calm, but conviction is scarce.

Zooming out to roughly three months, the picture becomes more nuanced. From the early autumn period to now, Société Générale has traded on a choppy upward-sloping path, supported by the broader rally in European financials as investors warmed again to higher interest rate margins. Yet every attempt to push decisively higher has met a wall of profit taking, reflecting lingering doubts over the bank’s earnings quality and execution on its restructuring promises.

The 52 week range underlines this divide. According to Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance, Société Générale’s stock has carved out a low in the high teens and a high in the low 30s over the past year, a wide corridor that captures both deep pessimism during periods of sector stress and bouts of optimism when European banks briefly came back into fashion. The current quote sits somewhere in the middle of that band, which is precisely where disagreement between bulls and bears tends to be most intense.

One-Year Investment Performance

If an investor had bought Société Générale stock exactly one year ago, the experience would have been a roller coaster with a mildly positive payoff at today’s levels. Based on closing prices from Reuters and Investing.com, the share traded in the low 20s at that time. With the stock now around the mid 20s, that translates into a gain in the low double digits in percentage terms for the period, before dividends.

Put differently, a hypothetical 10,000 euro position taken then would be worth roughly 11,000 euro today, not including the bank’s cash distributions. That is hardly the kind of explosive performance one might find in hot tech names, but in the conservative world of European banking, a double digit total return over twelve months is not trivial. The emotional journey, however, was anything but smooth: investors had to stomach sharp drawdowns during bouts of risk aversion and controversy around the group’s Russian exposure and capital allocation plans.

This backdrop explains why the prevailing sentiment feels closer to cautious optimism than outright euphoria. The stock has rewarded patient holders, but the gains came with enough volatility and negative headlines that many portfolio managers still view Société Générale as a name that needs constant babysitting. For value oriented investors, the past year reinforces the idea that entry timing matters enormously with this stock.

Recent Catalysts and News

In the last several days, the news flow around Société Générale has been relatively sparse in terms of blockbuster headlines, but not entirely devoid of signals. Earlier this week, sector wide commentary on European banks from major brokers highlighted French lenders as a mixed bag, citing solid capital buffers but also warning about margin pressure as the rate cycle turns. Société Générale often featured in those notes as a restructuring story with more moving parts than some peers.

More recently, French press and international financial media picked up on incremental updates around the bank’s cost cutting program and simplification of its business portfolio. While there were no new transformational deals or large scale disposals announced in the last few days, analysts continued to reference management’s prior commitments on reducing risk weighted assets and focusing on core franchises such as French retail, corporate and investment banking, and its African operations.

Because there has been no fresh quarterly earnings release or major management change in the past week, trading has been driven mostly by macro headlines, rate expectations, and shifting views on the overall European banking sector. In that sense, Société Générale has behaved more like a macro proxy than a single stock with unique news. If the news drought persists, the market may continue to treat it as part of a basket trade on euro area growth and capital requirements rather than a company specific story.

Should the current lull in company specific headlines extend beyond the next reporting cycle, traders will increasingly talk about a consolidation phase, with low volatility and declining volumes as investors wait for the next catalyst. For short term players, such phases are often frustrating, but for longer term buyers they can be an opportunity to build positions away from the noise that follows big announcements.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

The analyst community remains genuinely split on Société Générale, and the last month of research updates has not resolved that divide. According to recent reports surfaced via Bloomberg and MarketWatch, houses such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have adjusted their views on European banks, with Société Générale typically sitting in the middle of their recommendation spectrums.

Goldman Sachs, in its latest coverage of large euro area banks, keeps a neutral stance on Société Générale, effectively a Hold, with a price target that sits somewhat above the current market price but not enough to suggest a high conviction Buy. Their analysts emphasise the potential for capital return through dividends and buybacks, but flag execution risk around disposals and the cost base.

JPMorgan’s most recent note on French banks, issued within the last few weeks, takes a slightly more constructive angle, tilting toward an overweight view for investors who can tolerate restructuring risk. Their price objective points to a more meaningful upside relative to today’s level, but is still framed within a broader caution about the sector’s sensitivity to growth and regulation.

Deutsche Bank and UBS, meanwhile, have tended to hover around Hold on Société Générale, with price targets clustered in a band bracketing the current quote. They highlight that valuation multiples, based on price to tangible book value and earnings, look undemanding compared with history and some peers, yet they hesitate to move to full Buy recommendations until they see a cleaner earnings trajectory and further delivery on the strategic plan.

Aggregating those perspectives, the Street verdict can best be described as a guarded Hold with pockets of selective Buy. The consensus target price sits comfortably above the present trading price, pointing to moderate upside, but the language in the notes makes clear that this is a show me story rather than a blind faith bet. For retail investors reading between the lines, that means analysts see potential, but they also see enough ways for the story to disappoint that they are not pounding the table.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Société Générale’s business model is a complex blend of French retail banking, corporate and investment banking, international retail franchises and specialised financial services. The strategic thrust in recent years has been to simplify this portfolio, shed non core or capital intensive activities, and redeploy resources toward areas where the bank can earn attractive returns without stretching its balance sheet.

Looking ahead, several factors will determine whether the stock breaks decisively higher or slips back toward the lower end of its 52 week range. First, the interest rate environment remains crucial: a faster than expected easing cycle in Europe could compress net interest margins faster than management can offset through volume growth or cost savings. Second, the credibility of the cost cutting and restructuring agenda will be tested quarter by quarter, as investors demand concrete evidence of improved efficiency rather than merely promises.

Third, regulatory and political risk in France and the wider euro area will continue to cast a shadow. Any shift in capital requirements or banking sector taxes can quickly change the earnings equation for institutions like Société Générale. On the positive side, the bank’s relatively strong capital ratios and its track record of managing through past crises provide a cushion that value investors take seriously.

In the coming months, the most plausible base case is a stock that fluctuates within a broad band, with occasional bursts of optimism around results or strategic milestones. If management delivers cleaner earnings, hits its capital and cost targets, and avoids fresh controversy, the market could gradually rerate the shares toward the upper half of their recent range. If, however, macro conditions deteriorate or the restructuring drags on without clear payoff, the patience of today’s cautious optimists may wear thin, and the balance of sentiment could tilt back toward the bears.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404989_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 18:13:34.990349

Turning Policy into Practice The Korea–HP partnership demonstrates that global innovation is no longer confined to regional clusters.
By embedding HP Garage 2.0 into Korea’s AroundX framework, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups is creating a new template for public–private co-development.","Korea’s global startup diplomacy is turning into tangible infrastructure. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups (MSS) has joined hands with HP to bring Silicon Valley’s “garage innovation” model to Korean soil. Through the AroundX global open innovation program, the partnership will enable Korean startups in AI and data science to build, test, and scale with real-world access to HP’s global networks and technology base.

MSS and HP Sign MOU to Accelerate AI and Data Startups

Vice Minister Noh Yong-seok of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups met with David McQuarrie, Chief Commercial Officer of HP Inc., at HP’s U.S. headquarters on January 9 (local time) to discuss collaboration in the startup sector.

Following the meeting, the Korea Institute of Startup and Entrepreneurship Development (KISED) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with HP to jointly operate the AroundX Global Corporate Collaboration Program, marking HP’s official participation in the initiative starting 2026.

Under the agreement, both sides will strengthen cooperation to enhance the global competitiveness of Korean startups in AI and data science and support their entry into international markets through HP Garage 2.0, the company’s global open innovation and startup acceleration platform.

The Garage Spirit Meets AroundX

HP’s participation represents more than a corporate alliance, reflecting a bridge between Korea’s policy-driven innovation model and Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial DNA.

HP has operated its “HP Garage 2.0” program to cultivate startups based on the founding spirit of its 1939 Palo Alto garage, long regarded as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. The program connects early-stage innovators to HP’s R&D infrastructure and commercialization expertise across the global market.

By localizing HP Garage 2.0 through AroundX, the MSS aims to translate the symbolic “garage innovation” culture into a structured Korean model—where startups receive both policy backing and corporate collaboration under a single framework.

Statements from the Stakeholders on the Partnerships

David McQuarrie, Chief Commercial Officer of HP, said:

“Korea has one of the most dynamic ecosystems in AI and data science. Through this partnership, we will leverage HP’s global network and technological capabilities to collaborate with outstanding Korean startups and create new innovation opportunities.”

Noh Yong-seok, First Vice Minister of SMEs and Startups, stated:

“It is deeply meaningful to work with HP, a company that embodies the entrepreneurial spirit that created Silicon Valley. Through the AroundX ‘HP Garage 2.0’ program, we aim to help Korean startups expand globally and foster the next generation of world-class companies.”

How AroundX Becomes the Core of Korea’s Global Innovation Network

The AroundX Program, launched by the MSS in 2019, has grown into one of Korea’s most comprehensive public–private platforms for cross-border startup cooperation. It connects domestic startups with multinational corporations such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, Oracle, and Intel, enabling proof-of-concept (PoC) projects, co-marketing, and localized R&D collaboration.

With HP joining alongside OpenAI, Mercedes-Benz, and Astellas, the program now extends across AI, mobility, and biotechnology. AroundX’s evolution represents Korea’s broader transition from isolated pilot projects to ecosystem-level global partnerships—where collaboration becomes an operating model, not a single event.

HP’s collaboration with the MSS marks a deeper layer of Korea’s global startup expansion strategy. It moves policy cooperation beyond memorandums and conferences into sustained, structural partnerships.

For AI and data startups, this alliance provides practical access to HP’s research ecosystem and international markets, while for Korea, it symbolizes the transformation of its startup policy from government-driven support to co-owned global execution.

Industry analysts view the AroundX–HP partnership as a case study in how governments can transform startup diplomacy into global infrastructure—linking Korea’s venture ecosystem to the innovation networks of Silicon Valley, Europe, and beyond.

Turning Policy into Practice

The Korea–HP partnership demonstrates that global innovation is no longer confined to regional clusters. By embedding HP Garage 2.0 into Korea’s AroundX framework, the Ministry of SMEs and Startups is creating a new template for public–private co-development.

For Korean founders and investors, this partnership represents access not just to mentorship but to the infrastructure of global commercialization. It also reaffirms Korea’s trajectory toward becoming a deep-tech hub of the Asia-Pacific, where government policy, corporate innovation, and startup ambition meet in a shared ecosystem of scale.",https://koreatechdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Korea-and-HP-Unite-to-Build-the-Next-Global-AI-Powerhouses-Through-AroundX-and-Garage-2.0.-COVER.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 18:59:28.516747

The foundation AI model company’s Claude for Healthcare offering comes on the heels of Claude for Life Sciences, which it launched in October. The announcement, made in conjunction with the kickoff of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, marks Anthropic’s continued foray into regulated, high-stakes clinical environments.

Claude for Healthcare features HIPAA-ready infrastructure for enterprise customers, models trained specifically for healthcare and life sciences tasks and native integrations to commonly-used medical and scientific databases, including the CMS Coverage Database, ICD-10 codes and PubMed, according to the company.

The AI safety and research company also announced new capabilities for life sciences, extending from preclinical R&D into clinical operations and regulatory affairs.

The new capabilities mark Anthropic’s first foray in healthcare, but the company clearly sees big opportunities in the space.

Healthcare and life sciences represent one of Anthropic’s largest bets, Eric Kauderer-Abrams, head of biology and life sciences at Anthropic, told Fierce Healthcare.

The company's move into healthcare follows OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Health last week, which is a hub to let users upload their medical records, as well as OpenAI for Healthcare as a suite of tools for healthcare enterprises.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives and senior research staff in 2021, developed a family of large language models called Claude.

Claude for Healthcare is built around Anthropic’s existing AI models but with connections to tools like medical databases and coding systems that make medical information easier to find, access and understand. With a HIPAA-ready infrastructure, healthcare organizations can deploy Claude for workflows involving protected health information like prior authorization for the first time, according to executives.

“These are not new models or even new products. What we're announcing is a coherent set of connectors so that Claude our models and Claude our products, however you're accessing Claude, whether it's through the chat interface or through Claude code or our enterprise offering, have the connections to the tools that professionals in healthcare and life sciences are using every day so that it can accelerate all the work they're doing, have all the context that they need to have and be present as a collaborator throughout the whole process, and function as a real amplifier of human capabilities,” Kauderer-Abrams said.

He added, “Our approach is to build useful tools and connections and make sure that our models are at a superhuman-level in all these use cases for payers, providers and health systems and for consumers as well. For life sciences, it’s about making sure that our models have skills spanning everything from the early-stage discovery through translation and commercialization, and that they connect to the tools that scientists and life science professionals are using every day.”

Kauderer-Abrams stressed that Anthropic is laser-focused on supporting AI for enterprise customers in healthcare rather than consumer health applications.

The company asserts that its commitment to building safe, responsible AI makes it uniquely suited to work with health systems, hospitals, payers and other healthcare organizations.

“Anthropic is a very natural fit for the healthcare and life sciences world because our identity as an AI company is built around safety and responsibility and rigor and reproducibility, and these are all the central tenants of the healthcare and life sciences industries,” he noted.

There are a number of pharma companies, health systems and startups already using Claude’s suite of LLMs—Banner Health, Stanford Healthcare, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, AbbVie and Genmab—to automate administrative workflows like clinical documentation, regulatory submissions and clinical trial analysis.

“We were drawn to Anthropic's focus on AI safety and Claude's Constitutional AI approach to creating more helpful, harmless, and honest AI systems,” said Mike Reagin, chief technology officer at Banner Health, in a statement.

“Safety is non-negotiable in healthcare. Anthropic has been a clear leader in building models with strong safety foundations,” said Justin Norden, M.D., co-founder of startup Qualified Health.

“A big piece of the challenge of using AI in healthcare is there's basically no room for error. The cost of hallucinations, for example, or even the cost of non-reproducible analyzes is very high. We’ve done a lot of work to solve those problems,” Kauderer-Abrams said.

Anthropic uses specific technical methods during production model training to reduce the frequency of hallucinations and works to ensure that the results pulled from medical databases are accurate, cited and reproducible, he noted.

Anthropic boosted its life sciences AI leadership when it brought Kauderer-Abrams on board six months ago. The executive’s resume includes co-founding several computational biology startups.

With Claude for Healthcare, enterprise healthcare integrations now enable Claude to pull information from industry-standard systems and databases, meaning that clinicians and administrators can save time finding the data and generating the reports they need, executives said. Claude now connects to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database, including both Local and National Coverage Determinations. This enables Claude to verify coverage requirements, support prior auth workflows, reduce claim denials and surface regional coverage differences, according to the company.

Claude also connects to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) to look up both diagnosis and procedure codes to support medical coding, billing accuracy and claims management; the National Provider Identifier Registry, to help with provider verification, credentialing, networking directory management and claims validation; as well as PubMed, which provides access to more than 35 million pieces of biomedical literature.

The company also added new Agent Skills for FHIR Development to help developers connect healthcare systems faster and with fewer errors, improving the interoperability of medical data, executives said.

Claude for Healthcare’s HIPAA-ready infrastructure gives healthcare organizations a “plug-and-play” solution, Kauderer-Abrams said.

“A big part about being useful in healthcare and life sciences is respecting the intense compliance requirements that are there, and with good reason. We’re offering our solutions in a HIPAA-compliant way so that you can build applications around them, and so that you can do so in a way that respects all the relevant regulations. We're also the only major foundation model that's available through all of the major cloud providers,” he said.

The new AI tools available through Claude can support healthcare startups building new products as well as large enterprise health systems looking to integrate AI deeply into their operations, the company claims. By quickly pulling relevant information from coverage requirements, patient records and clinical guidelines, these AI resources can help organizations with time-intensive, burdensome administrative tasks like prior authorization requests and claims appeals and can also support care coordination and triage patient messages, Anthropic executives said.

“It’s really about amplifying the capabilities of the professionals in these healthcare organizations, so allowing you to be more productive, and allowing AI to take some of the grunt work off your plate and do it more efficiently and quickly. There is a huge amount of headroom to be had in terms of lessening the administrative burden,” Kauderer-Abrams said. “It's about the model being useful end-to-end, throughout all the processes, connecting to the tools that you use in your enterprise, operating in it natively as you do.”

Claude for Healthcare also includes consumer health integrations to enable individuals to share their health information as well as fitness and wellness data from different apps. Individuals can use Claude to summarize their medical history, understand test results in plain language, spot patterns across fitness and health metrics or prep questions for doctor appointments, according to Anthropic.

In the U.S., Claude Pro and Max plan subscribers can give Claude secure access to their lab results and health records. New HealthEx and Function connectors are now available in beta, while Apple Health and Android Health Connect integrations are rolling out in beta this week via the Claude iOS and Android apps.

Providers and healthcare companies have long had ambitions to collect patients’ health information all in one place—a longitudinal health record that makes it easier for patients to manage their health. But it’s been a bumpy road. Microsoft and Google both launched personal health record offerings but then shut them down.

Kauderer-Abrams is bullish that AI can finally make this happen.

“I’m excited about this idea of taking all of the context that you have about patients that are scattered throughout all these different places and having one system that can consolidate it all and connect natively into all the tools that are present in these healthcare systems to make care delivery more effective and more efficient,” he said. “Maybe we were all a bit misguided in trying to put all of the health at records in one place. That's too hard. Make the models go and do the hard work of figuring out how to interface and communicate and make sure all the connections are in place. That’s why I'm optimistic that the problem is solvable now is that there's been this unlocking intelligence.”

On the life sciences side, Anthropic is adding connectors to clinical trial solutions company Medidata, ClinicalTrials.gov, life sciences preprint servers bioRxiv & medRxiv, Open Targets, ChEMBL and Owkin.

The existing life sciences connectors include Benchling, 10x Genomics, PubMed, BioRender, Synapse.org and Wiley Scholar Gateway.

“On the life sciences side, I'm really excited to get to the point where you can have Claude as that collaborator through all stages of the R&D process and where Claude can take on increasingly large chunks of work and be increasingly autonomous,” Kauderer-Abrams said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/Logo%20card%20-%20Multi%20-%20Clay.jpg?VersionId=U.PpJDP4VGU9aZFbHX7IguNEHItqxH5T,N,,2026-01-11 18:13:31.002966

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

This is one you’ll never forget.” As he has often been in his first season as head coach, Johnson was right.
But what does that mean to a Bears team that scored 10 points in two minutes to beat Green Bay in Week 16?
“So this one meant something to us.” The rivalry is alive and well, and the Bears’ coach is fanning its flames.
To his first playoff win as Chicago Bears head coach.” Williams gave the ball to Johnson and the two embraced.","CHICAGO — When the Chicago Bears faced an 18-point halftime deficit and had been thoroughly dominated for two quarters, head coach Ben Johnson had an ambitious message for his team.

“We’re gonna have the greatest comeback in Bears history,” tight end Cole Kmet said, relaying Johnson’s halftime proclamation after the 31-27 wild-card win against the Green Bay Packers. “And we did.”

The 2025 Bears are accustomed to comeback wins, but this?

The Packers had averaged 7.2 yards per play through two quarters. Quarterback Jordan Love already had three touchdown passes. Four Packers had a run for more than 10 yards — the Bears’ longest run went for 9 yards.

Quarterback Caleb Williams was 8-for-17 passing with an interception. Green Bay was 3-for-3 in the red zone. The Bears were 4-for-9 on third down. Starting linebacker T.J. Edwards left the game and would not return.

And the Packers would start the second half with the football.

“I said it to you at halftime,” Johnson told the team in his postgame speech, “this is one you’ll never forget. This is one you’ll never forget.”

As he has often been in his first season as head coach, Johnson was right.

This is a team that has prided itself on not flinching and not panicking. At times in the first half, it didn’t look that way, whether it was offensive miscues, turning it over on downs, or giving up big plays. But Johnson leaned on the experience and belief they had to rally back. The message hit.

“It was the only option we had was to go out there and be legendary, to go out there and execute, to go out there and do our part on the offensive side, defensive side and special teams,” Williams said. “Have each other’s back, go win the effing game.”

During training camp, Johnson showed the team Super Bowl LI, when the New England Patriots came back from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28.

Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett played for the Falcons that day, and guard Joe Thuney played for the Patriots. Johnson had those players speak about their perspectives.

“It’s a good lesson to be learned that you know it’s 28-3 in the middle of the third quarter and yet the game still being played, there’s a lot of time left,” Johnson said Saturday night. “That was my message to the group was just reminding them that this has been done before and rather than saying, ‘Woe is me’ and ‘Crap, we’re in a hole,’ it’s more this is a great opportunity for us to turn this thing around into a game that we’ll never forget, and that’s what he did.”

When he told them to do something legendary, he could remind them of that Super Bowl. Anything can happen.

Kmet said the response wasn’t necessarily a rah-rah but more business-like.

“It’s just like all right,” he said, “let’s go do it.”

They had done it time and time again, including against this Packers team in this building three weeks earlier. Belief wasn’t an issue. That had been built.

When the defense forced three consecutive punts and the offense responded with only six points, though, that hope could waver.

But that’s where Johnson’s other message came in: one play at a time. That’s a familiar one to the players.

“That’s the message since April; it hasn’t changed,” Kmet said. “And every play matters and your assignment, doing your job matters, and that’s stressed and that’s highlighted. You know, not only the big plays that are made down the field by the guys with the ball in their hands, but you know, by the guys on the back side of the play, what they’re doing. That matters just as much, and that’s stressed, that’s emphasized. I think everyone in here takes it to heart.”

Running back D’Andre Swift’s touchdown with 10 minutes to go, which cut the deficit to 21-16, got the stadium rocking. They chipped away, played complementary football, and suddenly it was a whole new ballgame.

Then the Packers went up 11 points on the ensuing drive. But what does that mean to a Bears team that scored 10 points in two minutes to beat Green Bay in Week 16? They just had to go one play at a time.

“Every team’s different, but certainly it seemed to resonate with those guys, you know,” Johnson said. “And they did a great job. The only way you come back from a deficit like that is one possession at a time, trying to get more points on the scoreboard. Continuing to hold them and get the ball back to the offense.

“Special teams played a major factor in this game as well throughout. And so, yeah, you got no other choice. You’re not gonna get it all back all in one shot. And so yeah, just keep plugging along. And I think we had a couple field goals to get us going a little bit. And then the touchdowns eventually broke the dam.”

The players had to make sensational plays, like Williams’ throw to receiver Rome Odunze on fourth down and the touchdown to receiver DJ Moore, the defensive stops and pressure that forced Jordan Love to get out of his comfort zone.

Don’t tell the players they’re the benefit of luck, either. They’ve won this way too many times.

“To be in those situations and to come out victorious, it’s no fluke,” Williams said. “It’s no, ‘Oh, this happened, we’re lucky.’ We’ve done it multiple times this year. It’s been proven for us to be a great second-half team.”

Even trailing by three scores at halftime when it seemed like nothing was working, they knew if they could just get it to a one-score game…

“No f—ing panic,” Johnson said in the postgame celebration. “Built for pressure. That’s you guys.”

Johnson doesn’t show much emotion on the sideline. It creates quite the juxtaposition between in-game Johnson and postgame Johnson, yelling the team’s victory mantra, “Good, better, best.”

But after this win, the largest comeback in franchise postseason history, Johnson pumped his fist. He celebrated with Odunze, falling to the ground.

Sure, why wouldn’t he finally let loose and celebrate his first playoff win? But Johnson likes to be the same guy no matter what. This one had extra meaning.

“There was probably a bit more noise coming out of their building up north to start the week, which we heard loud and clear, players and coaches alike,” he said. “So this one meant something to us.”

The rivalry is alive and well, and the Bears’ coach is fanning its flames. He got the last laugh, so why not?

After Williams received a game ball from Johnson, he turned to his head coach and addressed the team.

“Everything he’s done for us as a coach, everything the other coaches have done for us — it started with him bringing everyone in,” he said. “For me personally, he’s been — (I’m) getting emotional — monumental in my life so far. To his first playoff win as Chicago Bears head coach.”

Williams gave the ball to Johnson and the two embraced. It’s a duo Bears fans hope can be playing football deep into January for a long time. This is just Year 1, and on a night when most would have counted them out, Williams and his teammates answered their coach’s message at halftime.

They completed the greatest postseason comeback in Bears history.

“We got a group of guys that just, they don’t waver if the odds are stacked against us,” Johnson said. “Despite the fact that we don’t like that score at halftime, nobody does. No one envisioned the first 30 minutes going that way. And yet, we just keep plugging along and we keep fighting. And we’ve proven that this year. That’s who we are and that’s what we do here at this point.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/11034337/USATSI_27982812-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-11 14:59:20.572361

Jensen Huang explains why the AI ""bubble"" debate misses the point

Fears about the AI bubble are growing louder as spending numbers surge and stock valuations skyrocket.

For perspective, Nvidia stock boasts a market cap of about $4.5 trillion, having added more than $1 trillion since the start of 2025.

Despite those jaw-dropping figures, Huang feels investors are looking at it the wrong way. He says what looks like excess is actually the early phase of a deeper shift in computing itself.

Clearly, AI spending is enormous, which can be seen from the latest capex figures from the Big 3 hyperscalers:

Amazon (AWS): CFO Brian Olsavsky said the tech giant expects full-year 2025 capex of nearly $125 billion (and higher in 2026), largely due to AI projects, Reuters reported.

Microsoft (Azure): Microsoft reported nearly $35 billion in capex in its fiscal Q1 2026, according to Reuters, warning that spending will continue rising as it builds AI data-center capacity.

Alphabet (Google Cloud): Alphabet bumped 2025 capex guidance to a whopping $91 billion to $93 billion, linked to AI/cloud demand. (Source:Reuters)

Additionally, Huang describes AI as a wholesale shift from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing, spearheaded by AI agents, models, and applications that are layered above that foundation.

Additionally, Huang pushed back on the concerns that Nvidia’s ecosystem investing creates some systemic risk.

Given the current dynamics, TSMC controls the bottlenecks in the AI supply chain, and that rare pricing power is showing its fundamentals.

As of Q3 2025, HBM made up a massive 57% of sales, with its cutting-edge 3nm nodes at 23% of wafer sales only a few quarters into ramp.

Also, as we witness a ramp-up in 2nm wafer production soon, and them being priced over $30,000 along with 5%–10% hikes on sub-5nm nodes, customers like Nvidia and Apple have little choice but to pay.

Located on Shanley Street, the property footprint has a total site area of 66,960m2, building improvements of 15,702m2, and a permit approved for further development.
The company successfully applied for a permit to construct another 7000m2 building out the front of the existing building.
""There is three megawatts of power that goes into the building and it has its own substation,"" Mr Noble said.

Located on Shanley Street, the property footprint has a total site area of 66,960m2, building improvements of 15,702m2, and a permit approved for further development.

Mike Noble, director at Garry Nash and Co Real Estate, said the property was bought by Bathla in Sydney in March 2022 with plans to build pod bathrooms out of Wangaratta.

The company successfully applied for a permit to construct another 7000m2 building out the front of the existing building.

The company bought up a portfolio of properties after Covid, however, when the building industry was impacted by the tough economy it decided to put multiple properties on the market, including Wangaratta.

""They got in there and tied up the building and carried out a lot of cosmetic improvements to parts of it that hadn't been used since Solectron were in there prior to Bruck,"" Mr Noble said.

He said a lot of the activity in regional areas is being driven by the broader regional economies rather than out of Melbourne.

However, when Garry Nash and Co first had it on the market and sold it previously there was a lot of activity from metropolitan occupiers.

""There is three megawatts of power that goes into the building and it has its own substation,"" Mr Noble said.

""It could be appealing to a lot of the occupancies in Melbourne that don't have a decent power supply for manufacturing or other operations.""

From a rental or occupancy cost perspective, regional areas are about half the price of metropolitan areas.

""Rent for the Shanley Street site would be around $80-$100 a square metre but it would be double that in Melbourne,"" Mr Noble said.

""Land tax is cheaper and there is still the 50 per cent stamp duty concession for commercial, industrial and extractive industry sales regionally and on this property it could equate to $200,000.""

To rebuild the property, Mr Noble said the cost would be about $30m and the owners would like $15m to basically cover their acquisition costs and what they've put into it.

He noted that it would be a challenge for an investor to buy it and secure tenants as there are almost 16,000m2 under roof, however if the operator had a purpose to use most of it, there is greater potential to lease out the remainder.

If an already operating business views the property as fit for purpose it would be ideal as Mr Noble said land is at a premium and even if you had the land you couldn't build what's there.

A RICH MANUFACTURING PAST

The building originated when IBM arrived in Wangaratta in 1976 with the intention of manufacturing electric typewriters and the facilities at the Shanley Street site were constructed in 1978-79 where the manufacture of personal computers began in 1983.

At the time it was only the third plant in the world to produce IBM PCs.

IBM sold the facility to Australia's privately held Bluegum Technology in November 1997, with the Wangaratta workforce continuing to manufacture computers under contract from IBM, followed in 1998 by a $250m contract from Alcatel.

In June 2000 however, the high-tech manufacturing plant passed into foreign hands, acquired by the US-listed electronics giant, Solectron Corporation.

In a devastating blow to the city, Solectron closed the manufacturing plant in 2001, resulting in the loss of 220 local jobs.

Bruck Group acquired the facilities some years later to use as an Australian base for Wilson Fabrics, prior to selling the site to its current owners in 2022.",https://images.wangarattachronicle.com.au/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1odz7l5ecxm5hmxya4p/0/shanleystbuildingsale_image001_58603-jpg.jpeg?f=3%3A2,N,,2026-01-11 14:14:20.017936

The news was announced on the first day of the National Retail Federation's annual convention in New York. The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" John Furner, Walmart's incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.

Google's new AI shopping feature works this way: if a customer asks what gear to get for a winter ski trip, for example, Gemini will return items from a participating retailers' inventory.

In the case of Walmart, customers who link their Walmart and Gemini accounts will receive recommendations based on their past purchases, and any products they decide to buy via the chatbot could get combined with their existing Walmart or Sam's Club online shopping carts, according to the statement.

OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use an instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart's website except for fresh food.

Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase. The race between OpenAI and Google has heated up in recent months.

Before the recent holiday shopping season, OpenAI launched an instant checkout feature within ChatGPT that allows users to buy products from select retailers and Etsy sellers without leaving the app.

San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI influenced $272 billion, or 20%, of all global retail sales, in one way or another during the holiday shopping season.

The new experience — built by Walmart and accessible directly within Gemini using the Universal Commerce Protocol — addresses several key customer needs:

Great items, at great prices: Gemini will automatically include Walmart and Sam's Club in-store and online products when it's relevant. For example, when a customer asks for advice on camping equipment for the spring season, it will return items from the retailer's large inventory of products. And since people talk back-and-forth with Gemini, there are more opportunities to show relevant products and services throughout the conversation.

Personalization and familiarity: When customers discover items in Gemini, Walmart helps them move from inspiration to purchase in a seamless, trusted experience — all within the familiar Walmart and Sam's environments they know and love. When customers link their accounts, Walmart will recommend complementary items based on their past online and in-store purchases, combine their order with other items they've put in their Walmart or Sam's Club carts, and provide all the benefits of their Walmart+ and Sam's Club memberships.

Fast delivery: Customers and members can get in-store and club items delivered right where and when they want it, with hundreds of thousands of locally curated products delivered in under three hours and as fast as 30 minutes.

Born in Cranston, she was the beloved daughter of the late Vincenzo and Teresa (Fusco) Soscia, she was predeceased by her husband of 70 years, Arthur C. Micallef. Rosalie was the devoted mother of Arthur A. Micallef and his wife Beverly, Gregory E. Micallef, and Susan Micallef- Burke, and the proud matriarch of 5 grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren. The youngest of 9 children, “PeeWee” grew up in a home filled with love and commotion, a much simpler era, in the heart of then rural Knightsville, with deeply rooted traditions. One in particular, the Feast of the Madonna Della Civita, was always, and remains still, an integral part of our family heritage. As an outstanding student at Cranston High School, she was nominated for two “superlatives”. Regulations allowed acceptance of only one, Rosalie chose “most athletic” over “most popular”. During World War II, as part of “the greatest generation”, while her husband flew in combat missions over Europe, Rosalie worked at the Fields Point Shipyard in Providence, now the site of Johnson & Wales Culinary Campus. As avid golfers, she and Arthur were founding members of the original Alpine Club, from its humble beginnings as a Social Club on Oaklawn Avenue in Cranston, now the location of the Immaculate Conception Church, to the elaborate Golf/ Country Club that it is today. With Rosalie’s inherent homemaking skills, the Micallef household was home to endless festivities from traditional Christmas and Family Sunday dinners to boisterous New Year’s parties- favored by Rosie and Art’s closest friends for “best food/ most fun”. In her late fifties, Rosalie decided to go to college and graduated from URI in 1981 with a degree in Communications. She utilized her education to advocate for everyday citizens while with the RI Attorney General’s Consumer Unit Division. Also, over many years, she and her husband traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia. They enabled their entire family to enjoy “Italy with Gerard”, and over 30 summers of fun at Bonnett Shores Beach Club. Truly special were year-round getaways to their White Mountains New Hampshire home, which they generously opened up to family, friends, and neighbors. Lastly, and befittingly, Rosalie achieved her final goal: to pass peacefully in her home of over 80 years. So, here’s to “a life well lived”! We raise a glass to Rosie – a very dry martini. Salute! The Micallef family wishes to acknowledge, with great appreciation, the exceptional personal care Rosalie received especially from Victoria, her truly dearest friend and primary care giver for over 11 years, and also the more recent assistance from “angels” Carrie, Verna, Quella, and Amanda.

The idea of the US decoupling from China is flawed, the CEO of American tech giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has said, highlighting that the economic and technological ties binding Beijing and Washington remain far deeper than widely perceived.

The comment comes as the world’s two largest economies remain locked in a series of mutual accusations. Washington has repeatedly accused China of unfair practices such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer, while Beijing condemns US export controls as politicizing trade and warns that they disrupt global supply chains and harm all involved.

“The idea that floated around about US decoupling from China, I think, is flawed, and our dependency on each other is quite significant and it’s deeper than people think,” Huang said in a video interview with Time released earlier this week.

The executive also highlighted the global dependence of the artificial intelligence (AI) sector on “the brilliant students and the brilliant scientists of China.” Huang added that 50% of the world’s AI researchers are from the country or have Chinese roots.

The US Department of Commerce in September placed 32 foreign entities, including 23 Chinese firms, on its trade blacklist. Among them were two companies accused of using US equipment to help manufacture chips for SMIC, China’s top chipmaker.

The blacklisted companies were accused of what Washington sees as undermining fair trade practices and its national security interests. Beijing strongly opposed the move, calling the sanctions an abuse of export controls, and soon after launched anti-dumping and anti-discrimination investigations into US chip policies.

US export controls on advanced AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200, a China-specific AI chip, had been implemented under national security rules for years, effectively restricting shipments to China. In December 2025, US President Donald Trump reversed part of the previous ban and allowed exports of H200, a China-specific AI chip, to “approved” Chinese customers under a regulated licensing regime with a 25% fee to the US government.

Despite US approval, Chinese regulators initially paused or limited orders, citing the necessity to access rules and balance AI demand with support for domestic chip development. Earlier this month, media reports indicated that China is moving toward authorizing H200 imports, potentially with conditions restricting usage and domestic procurement.

An instant checkout function will allow customers to make purchases from some businesses and through a range of payment providers without leaving the Gemini chat they used to find products, according to Walmart and Google.

The news was announced on the first day of the National Retail Federation’s annual convention in New York. The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.

“The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,” John Furner, Walmart’s incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.

Google’s new AI shopping feature works this way: if a customer asks what gear to get for a winter ski trip, for example, Gemini will return items from a participating retailers’ inventory.

In the case of Walmart, customers who link their Walmart and Gemini accounts will receive recommendations based on their past purchases, and any products they decide to buy via the chatbot could get combined with their existing Walmart or Sam’s Club online shopping carts, according to the statement.

OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use an instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart’s website except for fresh food.

Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer’s website to complete a purchase. The race between OpenAI and Google has heated up in recent months.

Before the recent holiday shopping season, OpenAI launched an instant checkout feature within ChatGPT that allows users to buy products from select retailers and Etsy sellers without leaving the app.

San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI influenced $272 billion, or 20%, of all global retail sales, in one way or another during the holiday shopping season.

Google said the AI-assisted shopping features in Gemini only would be available to U.S. users initially but that it planned to expand internationally in the coming months.

Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.
The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes.
But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.","Wing, the Alphabet-owned company that delivers groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and hot lattes, is expanding its partnership with Walmart for the second time in less than a year.

The two companies announced on Sunday plans to bring the on-demand drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores. The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing’s new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch.

The expansion suggests customers are using Wing’s drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.

The 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.

The announcement places the former Google X project firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.

The companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.

Wing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance. But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.

Rivera said Wing will likely try a couple of different approaches to scaling its operations like clustering store openings. It’s an approach Wing used last year when it launched six stores together in Atlanta. Rivera would not share if its operations are profitable or when they might be. But Rivera did note she was brought in to scale the business.

“And so that is what I’m here to do, and excited about,” she said, later noting that “volume is definitely powering our flywheel.” In other words, scaling to as many stores in as many markets as possible is critical for its business economics.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ywvle5Kwp1vgvDo3XvqfLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/0969698a0cfb05dcbb640eb64ebd0ed6,N,,2026-01-11 14:59:36.719771

The huge project is expected to cost a whopping $5 billion and will take years to complete.

Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has completed a new use and land agreement (ULA) with its airlines, finalizing how they will be impacted by the expansion.

The major airport is set to almost double its capacity with 32 gates being added to the site that currently has 34.

Initial plans stated an increase by 20 gates which was then renegotiated.

To cater for the arrival, a major new concourse will be constructed.

Concourse B will host 26 of the new gates and will oversee domestic flights only.

The original concourse will be for international and domestic flights, according to Aviation Week.

Meanwhile, the six other new gates will be part of a small, standalone terminal – Concourse M.

“Concourse M will support construction phasing, accommodate new airline entrants and provide operational flexibility for irregular operations, including off-schedule and diverted flights,” airport execs said.

Under the finalized ULA with airlines, carriers will be assigned the new gates gradually over the next decade.

Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the airport’s leading carriers, are expected to benefit the most from the expansion.

They will control half of the airport’s total gates once the project is complete.

Other signatories of the ULA include United, American and Alaska Airlines, all of which have agreed to continue operations at the airport for at least the next ten years.

The entire project is expected to be completed by the early 2030s.

As well as the new gates, it also includes the construction of a tunnel connecting the concourses, taxiways, and upgrades to the existing concourse.

The ULA “reflects years of partnership, thoughtful negotiations and shared vision with our airline partners,” the airport’s CEO Ghizlane Badawi said.

“The program, and all associated projects, are funded through traditional airport development funding sources, such as airport cash reserves, current and future airport revenues, future revenue bond proceeds and FAA grants,” said airport execs.

“No local Austin taxpayer dollars are used to fund the airport’s expansion program.”",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/01/newspress-collage-qdu3lft9j-1767947907842.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1767929928&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2026-01-11 13:59:34.063321

Additionally, Delta passengers faced numerous setbacks at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. The disruptions left some Delta passengers stranded for days.

Right here on The Travel, affected users commented on disruptions faced at AMS.

One person wrote, ""I was one of those stuck in ATL. My layover was 14 hours!""

Another person commented, ""My daughter was stranded at Shiphol airport from Saturday to Tuesday. After 3 days of canceled flights Delta refunded her fare and told her there were no flights to rebook her on. Trains were also cancelled due to frozen switches. She had to uber to the port and take a 17-hr ferry to the UK. She had to book a new ticket from Heathrow. This has been unprecedented!""

Passengers fear these disruptions may only continue.

KLM has issued a statement in recent days regarding the fiasco that caused hundreds of flight cancellations.

Here's a closer look at KLM's statement, and how passengers are reacting.

KLM Apologized For The Recent Flight Disruptions At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol

Minister Robert Tieman is calling for a review of the flight disruptions at Schiphol Airport at the start of the year. Severe winter weather disrupted flights across the country. Issues persisted due to de-icing issues caused by KLM at the airport.

​​​​​​​

Marjan Rintel, KLM CEO, addressed the issue, stating that more needs to be done to inform travelers in the future if such disruptions take place.

“I understand that frustration. What we’re seeing is that people at Schiphol also need much more information than what’s in the app, what you get in email, or what you can find on your phone.”

Rintel added, “The problem, of course, is when you have to rebook 300,000 people and 70 percent of your flights are canceled because there is no capacity at the airport to fly, it’s very difficult to say: you’re going tomorrow, because tomorrow your flight might be canceled again. But what we’ve seen is that if you can’t provide that information, you still have to be there for all your passengers, to help them.”

Issues have persisted at AMS, with 245 flight departures delayed on Saturday, according to FlightAware. The delays affected 43% of departing flights from AMS.

Passengers in the United States are concerned that these issues may persist and that prominent carriers to the airport, such as Delta, may experience further setbacks.

The biggest issue for many passengers is that Delta may be powerless in these situations, while KLM has significant control over Delta flights.

Delta Air Lines' Passengers Fear That The Carrier Is Powerless Over Ongoing Disruptions At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol

Delta has seen many setbacks at Schiphol Airport this month.

​​​​​​​Among them includes restrictions on Delta Cargo products.

The cargo restrictions were in place until January 11.

Delta said in a statement, ”The restriction timeframe has been extended and is expected to remain in place through 11 January. This timeframe is subject to change based on operational conditions. “Delta Cargo will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as new information becomes available.”

Along with the cargo restrictions, Delta passengers experienced several setbacks in Amsterdam.

​​​​​​​One passenger reported that delays lasted up to 36 hours before finally finding another flight home.

""The real issue is/was the de-icing process. It takes hours for planes to get a slot in one of the 4 de-icing stations. This caused the pilots on two of the flights that I was on, to timeout and the flights to be cancelled. That happens on Sunday 4-th and Monday 5th. Yesterday I got another flight for the 6th. At 11 PM that flight gets cancelled.""

""So on the phone with Delta I see availability on the premium and delta one cabins which the agent denied to put me in. They give me a flight for the 7th, more then 36 hours,"" a stranded Delta passenger wrote a few days ago.

Other Delta passengers are alarmed by the disruptions, given that the carrier has minimal control and the international hub.

One person wrote, ""KLM handles everything for Delta in AMS. It's not the smoothest arrangement.""

Another user added, ""Everything happening at AMS right now is completely crazy and I think there’s little Delta can do. They rely on KLM for the ground operations there, and KLM is a mess.""

It remains to be seen what the rest of the month will look like, but for now, passengers are eager to see changes made at AMS.

Delta Air Lines Had The Most Flight Delays On Saturday

On Saturday, Delta Air Lines had the most delays, with 791. The carrier also had 12 cancelled flights.

According to FlightAware, there were 4,657 delays within, into or out of the United States on Saturday, along with 70 cancellations.

As for the other major U.S. airlines, American Airlines had 561 delays, while United had 419, impacting 16% of its flights.

On Sunday morning, Delta Air Lines had 76 delays and three cancelled flights.

The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.

With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with ""Instant Checkout,"" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.

Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.

""The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,"" Furner said in a news release. ""We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.""

Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, described the deal with Google's Gemini as ""another step toward creating seamless shopping experiences for customers and members that are more intuitive and personal than ever before.""

Pichai said in the release that Google is excited to work with Walmart ""on a new open standard to make agentic commerce a reality.""

For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start on an AI chatbot instead of its own app or website — is changing the retailer's digital strategy.

""Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,"" he said.

Walmart leaders have also been vocal about the ways that AI will change the workforce and the roles of its employees, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.

Le groupe français, qui détient actuellement 19,8% du capital de Banco BPM, a déposé une demande d'autorisation l'an passé en vue d'acquérir, selon son communiqué, un nombre d'actions suffisant pour situer sa participation dans la banque italienne ""immédiatement au-dessus du seuil de 20%"".

Selon l'agence de presse italienne Ansa, les conditions fixées par la BCE concerneront la gouvernance, le groupe français devant limiter à sept le nombre de ses représentants au sein du conseil d'administration de Banco BPM afin d'éviter une ""prise de contrôle de fait"" et d'éviter les conflits d'intérêts.

Selon des informations d'Il Messaggero parues en septembre et confirmées à Reuters par plusieurs sources, Crédit Agricole examine avec Deutsche Bank et Rothschild une possible fusion de sa branche italienne avec Banco BPM, qui envisage quant à elle plusieurs options après l'échec de son rachat par Unicredit.

Une fois obtenu le feu vert de la BCE, Crédit agricole compte monter en deux étapes au capital de Banco BPM, à 24,9% puis 29,9%, rapporte le Corriere della Sera, selon qui ces opérations seraient achevées en avril, date à laquelle l'établissement italien doit approuver ses résultats 2025 et renouveler son conseil d'administration.

Between the lines, that final drive felt like ""do or die"" for the defense, in the words of veteran Grady Jarrett.
The it Odunze referred to is the largest postseason comeback in franchise history, the Bears' first playoff win since 2010, first postseason win over Green Bay since 1941, and most importantly for this Bears team, a culture-defining moment.
In the Bears' locker room after the game, there was a variety of opinions on the momentum-swinging play.
Santos' third and final field goal cut the deficit to 21-9 less than two minutes into the fourth quarter.","As the seemingly never-ending, 11-play Packers drive unfolded, other members of the Bears offense remained near the benches with coaches, attempting to remain focused in case they had to take the field once again. But with the future of their magical season in limbo, focusing on anything but those final plays felt impossible.

""I was like, 'Man, let's just win this game, defense, let's go do our thing,"" receiver Rome Odunze said. ""We were trying to go over some plays on the sideline, and I was half looking, half like, I'm trying to watch this game. I turned into a fan at that point.""

Between the lines, that final drive felt like ""do or die"" for the defense, in the words of veteran Grady Jarrett. For Montez Sweat, the opportunity to secure the incredible victory was invigorating.

""We understood what was at stake,"" Sweat said. ""We just had to end the game.""

While the Packers offense reached the Chicago 23-yard line, pressure from Sweat, Gervon Dexter Sr. and the relentless noise of the home crowd closed in on Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love in the final 20 seconds of regulation. On the final play of the game, the chaos culminated in a fumbled snap and a last-ditch pass attempt that fell incomplete off the hands of nickel back Kyler Gordon. With zeros on the clock, a flood of navy swarmed the field as Soldier Field shook.

""I ran onto the field and just felt relief,"" Odunze said. ""Like, 'Wow, we really did it.' Definitely a win that will go down in history, and we're not done.""

The it Odunze referred to is the largest postseason comeback in franchise history, the Bears' first playoff win since 2010, first postseason win over Green Bay since 1941, and most importantly for this Bears team, a culture-defining moment.

""It felt great to have my first playoff win with these guys,"" Williams said. ""It felt great being able to fight the way we did and come out victorious.""

The Bears' wild card win wasn't the result of one specific play or player, but rather the team regrouping at halftime while trailing 21-3 and committing to clawing back, one snap at a time. In the Bears' locker room after the game, there was a variety of opinions on the momentum-swinging play.

For safety Kevin Byard III, the game-changing moment actually happened in the locker room at halftime, courtesy of coach Ben Johnson.

""Ben was just talking to the group, talking about, 'Hey, we've got 30 minutes. Let's make this the most memorable game in Chicago Bears history.'

""We all know we're a resilient team. There's no quit in this team. The league knows that the Chicago Bears are gonna play 60 minutes no matter what the scenario is, no matter what the score is.""

Linebacker D'Marco Jackson, who took over play-calling responsibilities after T.J. Edwards left the game with an injury in the second quarter, pointed to the opening drive of the second half.

""That quick three-and-out, it set the tone,"" Jackson said. ""I feel like the atmosphere rose up and the offense fed off that and special teams too, just making plays. It was really just complementary football for everyone.""

Receiver Olamide Zaccheaus believes the game shifted with that possession as well as the 37-yard punt return by Devin Duvernay just before the end of the third quarter.

""Honestly, the energy specifically that the defense brought in the second half,"" Zaccheaus said, ""they went three-and-out on the first drive. The defense sparked it off for us. Them coming out with that energy, getting a stop early. And then we had the big returns by Duv, too. Those were big plays just to create momentum for us.""

Duvernay's return allowed the Bears to start their first drive of the fourth quarter in Green Bay territory, which ultimately led to a 51-yard field goal by kicker Cairo Santos, who, at that point, was responsible for all nine Bears points.

""Even though it didn't seem like field goals were going to help early in the second half, it's chipping away with those three points,"" Santos said. ""We always talk about every point matters. I take pride in executing and putting points on the board when our unit is called because we just know it's going to be important at the end of the game.

""We execute from the first kick to the last like we depend on it.""

Santos' third and final field goal cut the deficit to 21-9 less than two minutes into the fourth quarter. For the veteran kicker, seeing the scoreboard reset to ""15:00"" for the final time was the only momentum-changing moment that he needed to see.

""When we shift into the fourth quarter, that's always a momentum shift for this team,"" Santos said. ""When it's time to have everyone's best, the game clock turns into the fourth quarter, that's when the fire ignites in all of us. Would love to start the game better as a team, but if that's what it takes, we'll be there every game.""

Right tackle Darnell Wright identified three plays on the next Bears possession, which followed another three-and-out by the Packers, that changed the course of the game. First, the 22-yard and 21-yard receptions by Loveland down the left sideline that moved the Bears to the Packers' 12-yard line, followed by D'Andre Swift's 6-yard touchdown run.

""I'd say the biggest one was probably when Swift scored,"" Wright said. ""I feel like we just needed one, needed one score, six points, get on the board. And then big catches by Colston. Those right there created a little spark we needed. It let us see the end goal.

""When you're down two or three scores, you can't really see how it's going to turn out. But when you close that gap, you can see, 'Okay, one stop, touchdown. One stop, touchdown.'""

The Bears didn't reach the end zone until 10:12 remained in the game, but by that point, the tide had already turned. While they trailed 21-16, the scoreboard didn't matter. The home sideline had absorbed all the momentum and sustained it by using the crowd's energy to their advantage. No additional motivational words needed to be exchanged. The assignment was clear.

""I think we just keep giving each other opportunities,"" Santos said. ""Nothing needs to be said. It's just understood that we've got the talent, the coaching to put us in position to execute what we need to do to win the game. It's just understood.""

Not to be downplayed is Williams proceeding to lead back-to-back touchdown drives to put the Bears on top, despite the momentum shift having already been completed. First came an 8-yard dart to Zaccheaus and a subsequent two-point pass to Loveland, capping off a quick 10-play, 76-yard scoring drive. Then, following a missed field goal by Packers kicker Brandon McManus, Williams took the Bears 66 yards on six plays, ending the go-ahead drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to receiver DJ Moore.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bears/z7abkb4dlculjf4ioclx,N,,2026-01-11 11:59:58.766795

Translated by: Saoirse, Foresight News

Under the GENIUS Act, stablecoin issuers are prohibited from paying interest to stablecoin holders.

Currently, Coinbase Exchange is offering users a 3.35% reward for holding USDC on the platform. This is possible because the GENIUS Act only prohibits issuers from offering interest, but does not impose restrictions on distributors.

However, before the U.S. Senate's relevant committee reviewed the ""Crypto Market Structure Act"" on January 15 (aimed at systematizing cryptocurrency regulation), a full-scale debate had already erupted over whether the ""ban on stablecoin interest should be extended to the distribution stage.""

Strong opposition from the banking industry

The American Bankers Association (ABA) is the leading group advocating for a comprehensive ban on interest payments on stablecoins. In an open letter released on January 5, the association argued that the interest payment ban in the GENIUS Act should not apply only to issuers, but should be interpreted broadly and extended to affiliates. They are pushing to have this interpretation explicitly included in the ""Crypto Market Structure Act.""

The Underlying Reasons Behind the Banking Sector's Strong Opposition

The reason the banking industry is so eager to completely ban interest payments on stablecoins is actually very simple:

Concerned about outflow of bank deposits;

A decrease in deposits means a reduction in the ability to lend;

Stablecoins are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Ultimately, stablecoins are threatening the stable and highly profitable business model that has sustained banking for decades.

The Comeback of the Cryptocurrency Industry

In the eyes of the cryptocurrency industry, this move by the banking sector is a major issue. If the restrictions of the GENIUS Act are expanded through the proposed ""Cryptocurrency Market Structure Act"" due to banking sector lobbying, it would effectively rewrite and narrow the scope of the already-passed legislation. As expected, this action has sparked strong opposition from the crypto industry.

Coinbase's Position

Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's Chief Policy Officer, refuted this by citing relevant research indicating that stablecoins have not caused significant outflows from bank deposits. He also added a new argument to the debate by referencing news about the digital yuan offering interest on payments.

Paradigm's Viewpoint

Alexander Grieve, Vice President of Government Affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, offered another perspective. He argued that even if interest were allowed only on stablecoins used for payment purposes, this would effectively amount to an indirect ""holding tax"" on consumers.

How about the situation in China and South Korea?

Although China and South Korea are not as fast as some other Asian countries in advancing policies related to cryptocurrencies, both have recently introduced a series of new initiatives regarding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoin regulations. The differences in their policies regarding interest payments are particularly noteworthy:

China's central bank has decided to offer interest on digital yuan payments, treating it on par with regular bank deposits, in an effort to promote the adoption of the digital currency.

South Korea's policy direction is closer to that of the United States: it prohibits the issuer from paying interest, but does not explicitly prohibit distributors from doing so.

From a macro perspective, China's aggressive policy stance becomes easier to understand. The digital yuan is not a private stablecoin, but a legal digital currency directly issued by the central bank. Promoting the digital yuan can not only counterbalance the dominant positions of private platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay, but also strengthen a financial system centered around the central bank.

Conclusion

New technologies give rise to new industries, and the emergence of these new industries often poses a threat to traditional ones.

Traditional financial institutions, represented by banks, are facing an irreversible trend toward the era of stablecoins. At this pivotal moment, resisting change brings more harm than good; embracing transformation and exploring new opportunities is a wiser choice.

In fact, the stablecoin industry presents significant opportunities even for existing market participants. Many banks have already begun to proactively position themselves:

BNY Mellon in New York, USA, is making moves to position itself in the custody of stablecoin reserves business;

Cross River Bank acts as an intermediary for Circle's USDC fiat on-ramp channel through application programming interfaces (APIs);

JPMorgan is also testing a tokenized deposit business.

Major card organizations also have a vested interest in this matter. As the scale of on-chain payments continues to expand, the business of traditional card organizations may face a decline. However, companies like Visa and Mastercard have not chosen to resist this trend; instead, they actively support stablecoin payment settlements, seeking new opportunities for development in line with the trend.

Asset management institutions are also entering the field. Funds such as BlackRock are actively promoting the tokenization of various investment funds.

If the banking industry's lobbying efforts ultimately succeed and a provision banning stablecoin interest payments is included in the ""Crypto Market Structure Act,"" the cryptocurrency industry will suffer a major setback.

As a professional in the cryptocurrency industry, I can only hope that the ""Crypto Market Structure Act"" will not include provisions that effectively undermine the ""GENIUS Act.""",https://assets.staticimg.com/cms/media/7feiEEHmJE61RECXMyp8rTcA5Qcsl0zSv6rz9NVjg.png,N,,2026-01-11 10:14:10.829928

La saison réinvente cette esthétique de la désinvolture, née sous les traits d’une très jeune Kate Moss immortalisée par la photographe Corinne Day dans les pages de The Face et i-D. Présents sur les sets, le hairstylist Eugene Souleiman et le make-up artist Dick Page avaient alors posé les jalons de la beauté grunge. Ils expliquent comment la réinventer aujourd’hui.

Retour aux racines

Statement anticonsumériste, réponse aux excès de glamour des 80’s, le grunge est une fulgurance de débrouillardise. “À l’époque, on partait en minibus avec Corinne Day et Naomi Campbell, sandwichs à la main, pour The Face. Je portais un petit sac à dos contenant quelques produits et des épingles à cheveux. On devait se montrer ingénieux”, se remémore Eugene Souleiman. Pour l’expert, c’est cet esprit qu’il faut conserver, car le grunge est un anti-style, “mais qui nécessite beaucoup de style pour être réussi”, précise-t-il. Une structure plus souple comme si la coupe avait repoussé naturellement, quelques racines qui rendent un blond plus nonchalant... L’allure doit être undone mais pas forcément anti-glamour.

Si l’entretien de la chevelure (coupe et couleur) s’allège un peu, tout réside dans le styling. La recette secrète du pro? “Mélangez un peu de conditioner sans rinçage à de l’eau et massez la mixture sur les racines. La chevelure gagne en volume et en texture, comme si vous aviez dansé toute la nuit”, dévoile-t-il. Aux plus pressées, le pro recommande le soin texturisant Hair Resort de Kevin Murphy à l’effet similaire.

About a girl

Même consigne côté pigments. Le teint est libre de tout sculpting, la bouche s’assombrit, le regard se délave. Crayons gras et rouges à lèvres s’appliquent sans pinceau et se fondent au doigt. “L’essentiel est d’accepter l’idée que rien ne doit être parfait ou trop travaillé”, insiste Dick Page, pionnier du no make-up make-up. Après des années d’overliner et de lip contour, le lipstick mat n’est jamais plus intéressant qu’après avoir vécu: smudgé, teinté, effet mordu... “Vous pouvez aussi carrément le remplacer par un crayon rouge brun, que vous glisserez dans votre poche et que vous appliquerez on the go sans miroir”, encourage le make-up artist, qui obtient des teintes parfaites en assourdissant ses rouges à lèvres d’un peu de crayon noir pour les yeux. “J’en ai un de L’Oréal Paris, un coup de cœur, qui est discontinué et que je trouve sur eBay.",https://www.harpersbazaar.fr/imgre/fit/~1~hbz~2026~01~08~a0cf75b1-8d04-45ad-86b8-96ca2a409ef0.jpg/1200x630/focus-point/441%2C580/when-i-wake-up-in-my-makeup-le-retour-du-grunge.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 11:03:26.408541

Last Week: Ottawa Charge 4, Vancouver Goldeneyes 2 The Charge looked fantastic in the first period.
The game had barely started when the Charge found themselves on the penalty kill.
The Charge got the first goal of the game - a tap-in by Savolainen off a great rush to the net.
The Week Ahead The Charge play their next game today at noon, and we'll have a full preview going up shortly, so I won't repeat things here.","We're so back.

Another week with just one game for the Charge, and oh boy was it a fun one! Ottawa just keeps on racking up wins despite their very poor start to the season.

The winning streak has been so good, in fact, that the Charge are now fifth in the league, tied with the Toronto Sceptres in points. A regulation win today would have them jump all the way up to third. I love the three point system.

Last Week: Ottawa Charge 4, Vancouver Goldeneyes 2

The Charge looked fantastic in the first period. They did a much better job of getting to the net than they usually do, and made shockingly few defensive mistakes.

The game had barely started when the Charge found themselves on the penalty kill. Thankfully, they killed it off without any problems and soon looked very much like the better team.

There was a scary moment early on where Kadirova threw a high hit on Abby Boreen, and Boreen was lying on the ice for a while. Thankfully, it looked like she just got the wind knocked out of her, and didn't miss a shift. That's not the first time Kadirova has thrown a dangerous hit, unfortunately. It feels like she's been having trouble adjusting to the physicality of the league all season, and after getting hit a few times early in the season it almost feels like she's overcorrected and is now throwing dangerous hits of her own. Hopefully she can figure things out soon.

The Charge got the first goal of the game - a tap-in by Savolainen off a great rush to the net.

That would do it for the first period. Ottawa looked like the better team but only had a 1 goal lead.

The second was still pretty good, but the game did start to look a bit more even. Kadirova had an absolutely ridiculous shift in the second period where she almost scored multiple times, but other than that the team didn't look particularly dangerous.

The Goldeneyes got another powerplay toward the end of the second, and it was absolutely wild. Manon McMahon almost got a shorthanded goal, and then Philips pulled off some unbelievable saves to keep the Goldeneyes off the scoresheet.

That ended up being a bit of a turning point. Vancouver really picked up the pace late in the second, but of course Philips turned them away.

There was another injury right at the end of the second, when Karvinen took a shot to the chest and was slow to get up. Thankfully she was also fine. We're getting close enough to the Olympics now that I'm sure fans of the national teams are worried about injuries, so I'm sure team Finland is glad she's alright.

The Charge got a powerplay right at the end of the second period that carried over into the third, but they didn't score on it despite some good pressure around the net.

It took about five minutes for Anna Meixner to bury a rebound to double Ottawa's lead. This is what happens when you actually get to the net.

Of course, the Goldeneyes couldn't make it easy on us. About halfway through the second period, Sophie Jaques, who should have been a Charge for life (yes I'm still hung up on the decision to pass her over in the inaugural draft), beat Philips to break the shutout and pull her team within one.

Things got weird at the very end of the game. First, Vancouver pulled their goaltender, obviously, but Brianne Jenner scored an empty netter to put the Charge up 3-1 with about a minute and a half left in the game (she had an opportunity to do a slap shot but unfortunately didn't take it). Then, pretty much as soon as the puck dropped again, Karvinen scored for Vancouver, so the Goldeneyes were back within one with just over a minute left. Finally, Rebecca Leslie scored for the Charge with the net empty, so we were back to leading by two, and the 4-2 score held.

Watching a team pull their goaltender in a one-goal game only to end up giving up two empty net goals gave me flashbacks to the DJ Smith era Sens. It's nice to be on the other end of one of those games.

Notable Performances

Savolainen had a fantastic game, especially offensively. It felt like she had the puck every time she was on the ice. Definitely her best game of the season, and that's saying something.

I really liked what I saw from Wozniewicz too. She was causing problems in the offensive zone all night.

Of course, I also need to mention Payton Hemp, who had two assists.

The Week Ahead

The Charge play their next game today at noon, and we'll have a full preview going up shortly, so I won't repeat things here.

After that, they head to Laval on Tuesday to take on la Victoire de Montréal. As someone who has attended every single game these two teams have played in Montreal, I can tell you right now that the Charge don't usually win these ones. Let's all hope they can turn things around, for my sanity if for no other reason.

The Victoire actually haven't been playing particularly well recently, with their top line being the main thing keeping them afloat. They're actually two points below the Charge in the standings, but they have two games in hand so it doesn't mean that much.

That one will be an Amazon Prime broadcast, with puck drop at 7pm EST.

ID7,Best Buy,2026-01-11 11:49:23+00:00,Yahoo Finance,AI is no 'business killer': Why Wall Street is buying software stocks in 2026 - Yahoo Finance,Francisco Velasquez,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-is-no-business-killer-why-wall-street-is-buying-software-stocks-in-2026-150016555.html,"Davidson analyst Gil Luria said in a research note, observing the industry is now in its third year of the AI shift.
The biggest impact on the software industry thus far has been ""narrative and scared customers unwilling to commit,"" he added.
Luria's pick for 2026 is Commvault (CVLT), where he sees a massive 50%+ upside and a $220 price target driven by sustained momentum and a rebound in margins.
The business is a ""subscription acceleration story"" with an ROIC north of 100% and price target of $250.
He highlights ServiceNow (NOW), with a price target of $781, as a giant in the early stages of this transition; JFrog (FROG), in a mid-transition, with a price target of $65; and Snowflake (SNOW) as the gold standard for the fully consumption-driven model, with a price target of $220.","The death of software has been greatly exaggerated.

""If AI is going to kill a business, the signs would already be there,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said in a research note, observing the industry is now in its third year of the AI shift.

The biggest impact on the software industry thus far has been ""narrative and scared customers unwilling to commit,"" he added. The latter may be a factor that's starting to change, as companies come to realize ""neither they nor their software vendors have been run over"" by AI.

As this ""scared"" money returns to the market, analysts from DA Davidson, Piper Sandler, and Truist Securities identified names likely to lead the recovery. A common thread runs throughout the trio's picks: These companies provide the infrastructure upon which AI is built.

D.A. Davidson's top picks focus on specialized growth and infrastructure resilience. Luria's pick for 2026 is Commvault (CVLT), where he sees a massive 50%+ upside and a $220 price target driven by sustained momentum and a rebound in margins.

Other stocks to watch include Manhattan Associates (MANH), a supply chain and retail software company. The business is a ""subscription acceleration story"" with an ROIC north of 100% and price target of $250. Up next is marketing platform Zeta Global (ZETA), which is benefitting from the ""replacement of legacy marketing tech"" and carries a $29 target.

Rounding out the list are Box (BOX), which is gaining ground via ""Enterprise Advanced"" upgrades with a $45 target, and Datadog (DDOG), labeled the ""complete Observability platform"" for complex AI-driven environments with a $225 price target.

Parallel to Luria's list, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish is looking toward the ""Gen Z"" winners and infrastructure plays. Fish highlights Rubrik (RBRK) with a $75 price target for its completed SaaS transition; Nutanix (NTNX), priced at $50, as it gains share from VMware; and Axon (AXON), with a $563 price target, for its recurring model in public safety and drone integration.

Meanwhile, Truist Securities analyst Terry Tillman writes that software skepticism often centers on ""seat and license-based pricing"" — the idea that if AI makes humans more efficient, companies will buy fewer software licenses. However, he argues that the industry is simply evolving, as the rise of agentic AI — autonomous bots performing tasks 24/7 — encourages a shift toward consumption-based pricing.

""As workflows move from human-initiated tasks to autonomous agents executing at scale, billing tied to usage becomes the most logical way to capture value,"" Tillman wrote, citing examples such as compute, data processing, and transactions. Unlike humans, AI agents don't sleep, meaning billable events can compound around the clock.

That shift favors vendors that can demonstrate daily ROI, invest heavily in R&D to expand use cases, and build transparent metering and governance tools, per Tillman.

He highlights ServiceNow (NOW), with a price target of $781, as a giant in the early stages of this transition; JFrog (FROG), in a mid-transition, with a price target of $65; and Snowflake (SNOW) as the gold standard for the fully consumption-driven model, with a price target of $220.

These companies are betting that as AI adoption ramps up, the volume of data processed and transactions executed will more than offset any decline in human seats.

In 2026, Wall Street isn't buying software because the hype is back in vogue; they're buying because the valuations are finally rational, customers are less paralyzed, and the ""business killers"" have yet to show up at the gate.

One of the main reasons Brooklyn has performed better than expected this season and its young players have looked more mature than their ages is due to the presence of the oldest player on the roster, Terance Mann.

Mann would have been the ninth-oldest player on the Clippers roster to put in perspective how young this team is and how young Mann is while being considered the primary veteran.
""I think he's learning how to be a young old man,"" Fernandez said after the loss to the Clippers.","A cardiac monitor measures a person's electrical activity in the heart and displays it as a waveform. Flatlining often spells the worst, while a jagged line signifies being alive.

In the world of the NBA, where the stakes aren't life or death, this illustration takes on a different meaning. If the Brooklyn Nets were hooked up to one of these monitors, they would most likely see the jagged line, showing signs of life and growth.

This season has had more peaks than expected thus far for the Nets, and while some fans may be disgruntled by the franchise's current ""no man's land"" positioning in the league standings, it's the proper way to tank. The youth are being developed, and they are being instilled with a competitive identity rather than one that focuses on a future draft pick.

One of the main reasons Brooklyn has performed better than expected this season and its young players have looked more mature than their ages is due to the presence of the oldest player on the roster, Terance Mann.

The Nets' most recent matchup was a 121-105 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, moving them to 11-24 in this campaign. Mann would have been the ninth-oldest player on the Clippers roster to put in perspective how young this team is and how young Mann is while being considered the primary veteran.

He is on the young side of 29 years old, and yet he has elevated the youngest team in the NBA in his eighth season in the league. Mann's veteran presence has mixed well with both players and coaches –– head coach Jordi Fernandez has noticed his skills.

""I think he's learning how to be a young old man,"" Fernandez said after the loss to the Clippers. ""We've put him in situations to be the vet, you know, in his late 20s, which is sometimes not extremely fair.""

Mann probably didn't expect so much of his role with Brooklyn to be centered around mentorship and leadership. He called his own number in the offseason, signaling for a breakout season, but he hasn't been in the most convenient situations to do so.

Oftentimes, when players get thrown into a vocal leadership role like Mann has been, it takes them time to adapt, but he's quickly adjusted to a new environment and found his way to help the team.

What is in the News

U.S. FDA clearance for the Hugo robotic assisted surgery system for urologic procedures, giving surgeons a modular, multi arm platform integrated with the Touch Surgery digital ecosystem and aimed at high volume operations such as prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy.

Broad U.S. commercial launch of the MiniMed 780G system using Abbott Instinct sensors, offering up to 15 day wear and automated insulin adjustments every five minutes as part of the Medtronic diabetes technology ecosystem.

Real world Diabetes Care analysis on MiniMed 780G, where users with recommended optimal settings recorded 76.3% time in range on missed bolus days, and more than 61% met three American Diabetes Association glycemic targets compared with 36.6% for other settings, based on Medtronic data.

Updated company guidance outlining approximately 5.5% revenue growth and EPS of US$5.62 to US$5.66 for 2026, expectations for 5.5% revenue growth and EPS of US$1.32 to US$1.34 in Q3 2026, and continued spending priorities. The guidance also notes the completion of a long running buyback program first announced in 2017, with 154,605,008 shares repurchased for US$14.3b, including 3,300,161 shares for US$308.7m between July 26 and October 24, 2025.

How This Changes the Fair Value For Medtronic

The fair value estimate is now US$111.05 per share, up slightly from about US$110.97, reflecting a very small upward tweak in the model.

The discount rate is now 8.78%, described as edging slightly lower from 8.78%, signaling a minimal adjustment in the required return used in the analysis.

Revenue growth is now 5.73%, trimmed slightly from 5.79% in the updated assumptions, which modestly reins in the top-line outlook in the model.

The net profit margin is now 15.73%, slightly higher than 15.71%, implying a marginally more optimistic view on profitability in future years.

The future P/E is now 28.31x, nudging slightly above the prior 28.29x assumption used in the comparative work, suggesting a very small shift in how the shares are being benchmarked against peers.

For millions living with diabetes, the biggest constraint isn’t just blood sugar levels. It’s hardware. Traditional insulin pumps tether users to tubes, bulky devices, and workflows that feel more like medical procedure than everyday life. Insulet, through its Omnipod platform, is trying to turn that paradigm on its head by making insulin delivery as invisible and automated as possible.

Instead of a belt clip and plastic tubing, Insulet offers a discreet, wearable insulin ""pod"" that sticks to the skin and talks wirelessly to a controller or smartphone. In an era where GLP-1 drugs are grabbing headlines and big tech is flirting with health hardware, Insulet is quietly building one of the most defensible ecosystems in diabetes technology: a patch-based, tubeless alternative to conventional pumps that has already pulled hundreds of thousands of patients away from syringes and tubes.

Insulet is not just another medtech supplier; it is a pure play on the future of automated insulin delivery and connected care. As payers and regulators push for better outcomes at lower cost, the company’s flagship Omnipod platform is becoming a strategic node linking patients, endocrinologists, and data-driven care models.

Get all details on Insulet here

Inside the Flagship: Insulet

When people say ""Insulet"" in the diabetes world, they almost always mean the company’s flagship product line: the Omnipod family of tubeless insulin pumps, today led by Omnipod 5. This is a wearable, patch-like pump designed for people with type 1 diabetes and some with insulin-requiring type 2. The core idea is simple but powerful: eliminate tubing, automate as much dosing as possible, and integrate tightly with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

The Omnipod system has three key components:

1. The Pod: A small, disposable, waterproof pod worn on the body for up to 72 hours. It holds insulin and houses a tiny cannula that automatically inserts under the skin when activated. There is no dangling tubing. Users can wear pods on the arm, abdomen, thigh, or lower back, making it easier to dress, exercise, and sleep without constantly negotiating around hardware.

2. The Brain (Controller or App): Earlier generations used a dedicated handheld Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM). With Omnipod 5, Insulet moves further into app-driven control. The system can be managed using a compatible smartphone or Insulet-supplied controller, allowing dose adjustments, bolus delivery, and system monitoring directly from a familiar interface. That shift not only modernizes the experience but embeds Omnipod into the broader mobile health ecosystem.

3. Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) Algorithm: The most transformative layer is software. Omnipod 5 connects to the Dexcom G6 and now G7 CGM systems (in approved markets) and uses a predictive algorithm to modulate basal insulin delivery automatically. Every five minutes, the system looks at current glucose, trend data, and the user’s personalized targets to increase, decrease, or suspend insulin. The goal: flatten the highs and prevent the dangerous lows, with minimal user micromanagement.

This combination of disposable pod, connected controller, and adaptive algorithm gives Insulet a unique proposition. The company has positioned Omnipod 5 as the first and, for now, leading tubeless, fully integrated AID system commercialized at scale. For parents managing type 1 diabetes in children, that means fewer nighttime alarms and more time in range. For adults juggling work, exercise, and diet, it turns the pump from a visible medical device into a nearly invisible companion.

Insulet’s roadmap is also increasingly platform-centric. The company is building deeper integration with CGM partners like Dexcom, exploring more smartphone-native control, and pushing cloud connectivity to feed clinicians and care teams with granular, real-world data. As virtual clinics and remote endocrinology scale up, Omnipod’s always-on, always-connected profile becomes part of an emerging standard of care.

Market Rivals: Insulet Aktie vs. The Competition

In insulin delivery, Insulet competes primarily against two dominant categories: traditional tubed insulin pumps and multiple daily injections (MDI) augmented by smart pens or connected caps. On the pump side, the two most relevant rivals are Medtronic and Tandem Diabetes Care.

Medtronic MiniMed 780G: Medtronic’s MiniMed 780G is a traditional, tubed insulin pump integrated with the company’s Guardian 4 CGM. Like Omnipod 5, it offers closed-loop or ""advanced hybrid closed-loop"" functionality: an algorithm automatically adjusts basal insulin and can give automatic correction boluses. The 780G’s strengths are depth of algorithm experience, strong clinical validation, and Medtronic’s longstanding presence in hospital and endocrinology networks.

However, compared directly to Omnipod 5, the MiniMed 780G still depends on tubing and a belt- or pocket-worn pump. That introduces friction points: snagging on clothing, discomfort during sleep, and a more visible medical profile. Setup and maintenance can also feel more complex for newly diagnosed users. Medtronic has been working to close the usability gap, but Insulet’s tubeless design remains a differentiated experience that many patients prefer, especially children and active adults.

Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ: Tandem’s t:slim X2 is a sleek, touchscreen insulin pump paired with Dexcom CGMs and powered by its Control-IQ algorithm. Control-IQ dynamically adjusts basal insulin and can deliver automatic correction boluses, competing head-on with Omnipod 5 on time-in-range outcomes. Tandem is strong on user interface design and has built a loyal following through software updates that can be pushed to in-market pumps, extending device life.

Compared directly to Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ, Insulet’s Omnipod 5 trades the polished rechargeable pump hardware for disposable pods that are entirely off-body except for the adhesive site. That shift changes everything from wardrobe choices to exercise routines. While some users appreciate having a reusable, durable pump body with Tandem, others see Omnipod’s patch format as freeing them from visible medical hardware.

New Front: MDI and Smart Insulin Delivery

On another flank, Insulet is competing with the accelerating sophistication of MDI plus smart devices. Products like Novo Nordisk’s smart pens and companies offering dose-tracking caps aim to keep patients on injections while layering in data and coaching. These tools are often cheaper and less infrastructure-heavy than a pump, making them attractive to payers and some adults with type 2 diabetes.

But they stop short of what Insulet offers: real closed-loop automation. Smart pens can track and optimize, but they can’t adjust basal insulin every five minutes based on CGM data. For users who need intensive insulin therapy and want fewer manual decisions, the Omnipod model still offers a qualitatively different experience.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Insulet’s edge comes from a combination of hardware design, human-centered UX, and software-driven automation, rather than a single breakthrough component.

Tubeless as a True Lifestyle Feature

The most obvious differentiator is the lack of tubing. For many patients, this isn’t cosmetic; it’s behavioral. A tubeless pod is easier to wear while playing sports, sleeping, showering, or managing small children. It reduces the constant visual reminder of illness. Adoption data and patient communities consistently highlight this as the main reason users move from tubed pumps or injections to Omnipod and then stay.

Disposable Platform, Recurring Revenue

Insulet’s model is built around recurring pod use, not just one-time hardware sales. Each pod is worn for up to 72 hours and then replaced, creating a high-margin consumables stream. That recurring structure incentivizes Insulet to continuously improve algorithms and app experience, because stickiness drives lifetime value. For users, the benefit is always receiving fresh, sealed hardware, lowering maintenance overhead and worry about mechanical wear.

Algorithm and CGM Partnerships

Omnipod 5’s integration with the Dexcom CGM ecosystem gives it instant credibility among clinicians and tech-forward patients. Dexcom is widely regarded as a gold standard in CGM accuracy and reliability. By choosing to partner instead of building everything in-house, Insulet can move faster on software innovation and expand compatibility as new CGM generations roll out.

Expanding Addressable Market

Insulet is not limiting itself to type 1 diabetes. Its platform is increasingly positioned for insulin-requiring type 2 patients and for markets outside North America, especially as reimbursement frameworks for AID systems evolve. As payers see better time-in-range and lower complication rates, the case for funding pod-based systems strengthens, particularly for patients who struggle with regimen adherence on MDI.

Ecosystem Lock-In Without Feeling Trapped

What Insulet is quietly building is an ecosystem where the pod, the app, the CGM partnership, and the cloud analytics reinforce each other. Once a patient is trained, data is flowing to clinicians, and families are monitoring remotely, switching systems becomes painful. The key is that this lock-in is largely experience-driven: users stay because the system works, not because they are technically unable to leave.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Insulet Aktie, trading under ISIN US45784P1012 and ticker PODD on the Nasdaq, is effectively a direct levered bet on the success and expansion of the Omnipod platform.

According to live market data checked across multiple sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Insulet Aktie was recently trading around the low-to-mid USD 190s range per share, with a market capitalization in the mid– to upper–single digit billions of dollars. As of the latest available quote on the research day, Insulet Aktie was changing hands at approximately USD 194–196 per share, with the figure reflecting intraday trading rather than a stale historical reference. Where real-time quotes were briefly unavailable or delayed, the most recent ""Last Close"" was used and explicitly marked by the data providers.

That valuation embeds several expectations: continued Omnipod 5 adoption in the existing type 1 base, expansion into insulin-requiring type 2 populations, geographic growth, and resilience against competition from both pump rivals and GLP-1 therapies that may delay or reduce progression to insulin. Investors have been watching three product-linked metrics particularly closely:

1. Pod Volume Growth: Rising pod shipments directly signal adherence and user growth. Strong pod volume typically translates into recurring revenue visibility and margin leverage, as manufacturing scales and logistics are optimized.

2. Algorithm & CGM Integration Progress: Regulatory approvals and rollouts of new Omnipod 5 features, additional smartphone compatibility, and deeper Dexcom integration tend to act as catalysts. Each software and ecosystem milestone strengthens Insulet’s differentiation versus Medtronic MiniMed 780G and Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ.

3. Reimbursement and Access: Positive reimbursement decisions from public and private payers are crucial, especially as Omnipod pushes further into type 2 diabetes. Better coverage unlocks new cohorts of patients, which in turn supports higher pod volumes and ultimately flows through to Insulet Aktie’s revenue and earnings trajectory.

While macro conditions, GLP-1 enthusiasm, and medtech sector rotations can create volatility in Insulet Aktie’s share price, the underlying story remains tightly tied to product execution. If Omnipod can continue to deliver superior time-in-range, lower hypoglycemia risk, and a meaningfully better user experience than tubed pumps or smart-pen MDI regimens, the company retains a credible path to long-term double-digit revenue growth. In that scenario, Insulet Aktie functions less like a cyclical device stock and more like a platform subscription play anchored in consumables and data.

Ultimately, Insulet’s investment case and its product story are the same narrative told through different lenses. On the user side, it is about fewer needles, fewer alarms, and less visible hardware. On the market side, it is about recurring pods, connected algorithms, and a defensible place at the center of next-generation diabetes care. If the company keeps executing, Omnipod will not just compete in the pump market; it will help redefine what an insulin ""device"" looks like at all.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405005_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 09:58:50.352155

When asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Mr Bessent said, “It could be as soon as next week,” but did not identify which ones.
IMF, World Bank re-engagement Mr Bessent, who controls the dominant US shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela.
An IMF spokesperson said the fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined to comment on Mr Bessent’s mention of a meeting next week.
Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduro’s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, declared that Venezuela “will no longer have to go to Washington” for funding.","– US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Reuters that additional sanctions on Venezuela could be lifted as soon as next week to facilitate oil sales and that he will also meet the heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank next week on their re-engagement with Venezuela.

Mr Bessent said in an interview late on Jan 9 that almost US$5 billion (S$6.4 billion) worth of Venezuela’s currently frozen IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) monetary assets could be deployed to help rebuild the country’s economy.

“We’re de-sanctioning the oil that’s going to be sold,” he said during a visit to a Winnebago Industries engineering facility. The Treasury is examining changes that would facilitate the repatriation of sale proceeds from oil stored largely on ships back to Venezuela.

“How can we help that get back into Venezuela, to run the government, run the security services and get it to the Venezuelan people?” he said of the Treasury’s sanctions analysis.

When asked when more sanctions could be removed from Venezuela, Mr Bessent said, “It could be as soon as next week,” but did not identify which ones.

The moves are part of the Trump administration’s effort to stabilise Venezuela and encourage the return of US oil producers to the country, a week after

US forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro

in Caracas and brought him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

US sanctions have banned international banks and other creditors from engaging with the Venezuelan government without a license. The institutions have cited this as an impediment to a complex US$150 billion debt restructuring widely viewed as a key to the return of private capital to Venezuela.

On Jan 9 , US President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking courts or creditors from impounding Venezuelan oil revenue held in US Treasury accounts, declaring that these funds should be safeguarded to help Venezuela create “peace, prosperity and stability”.

IMF, World Bank re-engagement

Mr Bessent, who controls the dominant US shareholding in the IMF and World Bank, said the two institutions had already reached out to him about Venezuela.

He said that the US Treasury would be willing to convert Venezuela’s IMF special drawing rights held at the fund to dollars for use in rebuilding Venezuela.

Venezuela currently has about 3.59 billion SDRs, worth around US$4.9 billion at the J an 9 exchange rate, but cannot currently access them. SDRs are made up of dollars, euros, yen, sterling and the Chinese yuan.

The Treasury in 2025 agreed to back a US$20 billion swap line for Argentina, partly with that South American country’s SDRs, in an effort to stabilise the peso and help Argentine President Javier Milei’s party win in the parliamentary election.

An IMF spokesperson said the fund was closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and declined to comment on Mr Bessent’s mention of a meeting next week.

The IMF has not engaged with Venezuela for more than two decades, with the last formal IMF assessment of Venezuela’s economy completed in 2004. Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan in 2007, when Maduro’s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, declared that Venezuela “will no longer have to go to Washington” for funding.

A source familiar with the World Bank’s internal discussions on Venezuela said that the development lender was in the early stages of exploring how it could be helpful to Venezuela, noting that the bank moved in quickly with assistance to Afghanistan and Syria after regime changes and provided early support to Gaza and Ukraine.

Fast movers

Mr Bessent said he believed that smaller, privately held companies would move swiftly back into Venezuela’s oil sector, despite reluctance voiced by some oil majors, including Exxon Mobil, whose past Venezuelan assets were nationalised twice.

“I think it’s going to be the typical progression where the private companies can move quickly and will come in very quickly. They haven’t talked about financing at all,” he said.

“Chevron has been there a long time and will continue to be there, so I believe that their commitment will greatly increase.”

Mr Bessent added that he believed there was a role for the US Export-Import Bank in guaranteeing financing for Venezuela’s oil sector, echoing previous comments from US Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

To date in this AI Tech Wave, Apple has been the most visible on stressing Health applications and services across its many platforms, from watches to iphones and other wearables.

And leaning in with its evolving Apple Intelligence to enhance healthcare AI features from hearing tests to body vitals monitoring and measurement.

Other tech companies like Google have also been focused on AI Healthcare Science, in particular with the Alphafold initiatives at Deepmind in particular. I’ve written about AI and Healthcare for a while now in these pages as well..

Now OpenAI is leaning into AI driven healthcare via ChatGPT as well. It’s something that has been building for a couple of years at least. And that is a Bigger Picture worth a discussion this Sunday.

Axios has a number of pieces on this OpenAI initiative in recent days. Including some broader concerns around AI in Healthcare. Axios notes in “OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health tools spark safety debate”:

“Mixed reactions to OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health feature highlight demand for more personalized medical help tempered by chatbot safety and privacy concerns.”

“Why it matters: Health has become a go-to topic for chatbot queries, with more than 40 million people consulting ChatGPT daily for health advice and hundreds of millions doing so each week.”

“Catch up quick: OpenAI is adding a new health tab within ChatGPT that includes the ability to upload electronic medical records and connect with Apple Health, MyFitnessPal and other fitness apps.”

“The new features formalize how many people already use the chatbot: uploading test results, asking questions about symptoms and trying to navigate the complex health care ecosystem.”

“OpenAI says it will keep the new health information separate from other types of chats and not train its models on this data.”

As I’ve outined before, both Trust and Privacy in AI solutions is a fundamental input at scale, which has given companies like Apple a bit of a headstart vs tech companies like Meta, Elon’s xAI/Grok, and others. It’s particularly a big one in healthcare of course.

“Yes, but: Health information shared with ChatGPT doesn’t have the same protections as medical data shared with a health provider, and even those protections vary by country.”

“The U.S. doesn’t have a general-purpose privacy law, and HIPAA only protects data held by certain people like healthcare providers and insurance companies,” Andrew Crawford, senior counsel for privacy and data at the Center for Democracy and Technology, told Axios in a statement.”

“And since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger,” he says.”

“OpenAI is starting with a small group of early testers, notably not those in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom where local regulations require additional compliance measures.”

The market of course will give OpenAI a chance here, given the global popularity of ChatGPT:

“The big picture: Many AI enthusiasts on social media welcomed the tools, pointing to how ChatGPT already helps them.”

“Yana Welinder, head of AI for Amplitude has been using ChatGPT “constantly” for health queries in recent months, both for herself and family members. “The only downside was that all of this lived alongside my very heavy other usage of ChatGPT,” she wrote on X. “Projects helped a bit, but I really wanted a dedicated space …So excited about this.”

“Chatbots aren’t a replacement for doctors, OpenAI says, at the same time highlighting what the chatbot can provide.”

“It’s great at synthesizing large amounts of information,” Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, said Wednesday on a call with reporters. “It has infinite time to research and explain things. It can put every question in the context of your entire medical history.”

But there are big technical problems to solve here as we rush into popular AI tools in front of us:

Especially given mainstream user propensity to humanize and anthropomorphize AI technologies so easily.

“The other side: AI skeptics question giving medical information to a chatbot that has shown a propensity to reinforce delusions and even encourage suicide.”

““What could go wrong when an LLM trained to confirm, support, and encourage user bias meets a hypochondriac with a headache?” Aidan Moher wrote on BlueSky.”

“Anil Dash, advocate for more humane technology, agreed on BlueSky that it “isn’t a good idea,” but also wrote that “it’s vastly more understandable than most medical jargon, far more accessible than 99% of people’s healthcare that they can afford, and very often pretty accurate in broad strokes, especially compared to WebMD or Reddit.”

The thorniest question of course is the fungibility of Data, which is the key ingredient to make AI do anything useful at all, especially in the ‘Physical AI’ world. It’s Box no. 4 in the AI Tech Stack below.

“Between the lines: Like other information shared with ChatGPT, health information could potentially be made available to litigants or government agencies via a subpoena or other court order.”

“That seems particularly noteworthy at a time when access to reproductive health care and gender-affirming care are under threat at both the state and federal levels.”

“User data could get swept up in other ways, too. As part of their copyright battle against OpenAI, news organizations have obtained access to millions of ChatGPT logs, including from temporary chats that were meant to be deleted after 30 days.”

“Sam Altman has called for some sort of legal privilege to protect sensitive health and legal information.”

“What to watch: OpenAI said it has more health features on its road map and will talk soon about additional work with various health care systems.”

Of course, the above discussion centers around OpenAI and other LLM AI chatbots being used by end users for their personal health.

The other side of the coin is the use of AI by pharma companies working with LLM AI companies, to discover and construct better treatments faster and cheaper, using Transformer based AI technologies.

Here, a must read piece by the Economist, “An AI revolution in drugmaking is under way”,provides positive data on how this is actually proceeding in these early AI days:

“It will transform how medicines are created—and the industry itself”.

“Insilico Medicine, a biotech firm in Boston, seems to have been the first to apply the new generation of AI, based on so-called transformer models, to the business of finding drugs. Back in 2019 its researchers wondered whether they could use these to invent new drugs from biological and chemical data. Their first quarry was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease.”

“They began by training an AI on datasets related to this condition and found a promising target protein. A second AI then suggested molecules that would latch onto this protein and change its behaviour, but were not too toxic or unstable. After that human chemists took over, creating and testing the shortlisted molecules. They called the result rentosertib, and it has recently completed successful mid-stage clinical trials. The firm says it took 18 months to arrive at a candidate for development—compared with a usual timeline of four and a half years.”

Fast forward to today, and the numbers are promising indeed:

“Insilico now has a pipeline of more than 40 AI-developed drugs it is assessing for conditions such as cancers and diseases of the bowels and kidneys. And its approach is spreading. One projection suggests annual investment in the field will rise from $3.8bn in 2025 to $15.2bn in 2030.”

“Tie-ups between pharma companies and AI firms are also becoming common. In 2024 a dozen deals were announced, with a combined value of $10bn according to IQVIA, a health-intelligence company.”

Nvidia is also a key company working with big pharma in these new healthcare AI arenas:

“And last October Eli Lilly, another pharma giant, announced a collaboration with Nvidia, the firm whose chips are widely used to train and run transformer-based AI models, to build the industry’s most powerful supercomputer, and thus speed up drug discovery and development.”

And both the pharma and AI industries are figuring out how to make the new economics work under long-established healthcare industry economics and regulatory regimes:

“Given the pharmaceutical industry’s weird economics—candidate drugs entering clinical trials have a 90% failure rate, bringing the cost of developing a successful one to a whopping $2.8bn—even marginal improvements in efficiency would offer big gains. Reports from across the industry suggest that AI has begun to deliver these. AI-designed drugs are whizzing through the preclinical phase (that before human trials begin) in only 12-18 months, compared with three to five years previously. And the success of AI-designed drugs in safety trials is better too. A study published in 2024, of their performance in such trials, found an 80-90% success rate. This compares with historical averages of 40-65%. That, in turn, boosts the overall rate of getting drugs successfully through the entire pipeline to 9-18%, up from 5-10%.”

Include in all this the context of ‘digital twins’ I’ve discussed before, and synthetic patients, and the AI/Healthcare aperture opens up further:

“The most intriguing use of AI to improve trials, though, is the creation of synthetic patients (sometimes called digital twins) to act as matched controls for real participants. To do this an AI goes through data from past trials and learns to predict what might happen to a participant if they follow the natural course of their condition rather than being treated. Then, when a volunteer is enrolled in a trial and given a drug, the AI creates a “patient” with the same set of characteristics, such as age, weight, existing conditions and disease stage. The drug’s efficacy in the real patient can thus be measured against the progress of this virtual alternative.”

“If adopted, the use of synthetic patients would reduce the size of trials’ control arms and could, potentially, eliminate them entirely in some cases. Their use might also appeal to participants, since the chance of receiving the treatment under test rather than being put into a control group without it would rise.”

Zoom out a bit, and one can see positive opportunities for OpenAI and the pharma industry on this end of the AI Healthcare ecosystem.

“Companies such as OpenAI, which led development of the transformers known as large language models, and Isomorphic Labs, a drug-discovery startup spun out of Google DeepMind, are already training systems to reason and make discoveries in the life sciences, hoping these tools will become capable biologists. For now, drug firms have the advantage of a wealth of data and the context to understand and use it, so collaboration is the order of the day. OpenAI, for example, is working with Moderna, a pioneer of RNA vaccines, to speed the development of personalised cancer vaccines. But as the new models make biology more predictable the balance of advantage in the industry may change.”

“Regardless of that, AI has already improved things greatly. If it can wring from late-stage trials the sorts of improvement it has brought to the earlier part of the process, the number of drugs arriving on the market should rise significantly. In the longer run, the possibilities for enhancing human health are enormous.”

The entire piece is worth reading in detail to get a fuller sense of the possibilities around AI and pharma processes to discover and develop new drugs.

This whole area of AI and Healthcare is just beginning to sort out the thorny details at this early point in the AI Tech Wave.

At both ends of AI and the Healthcare pipeline: The creation of drugs and treatments, and how billions of mainstream users interact with the healthcare industry to access the accelerated drugs and treatments. With all the trust and privacy safeguards put in place. And guardrails against AI anthropomorphizing by end users.

And that is the Bigger Picture to keep in mind before we all rush in with AI on our personal health in 2026 and beyond.

This new micromobility solution made its debut in Nvidia’s Showcase section, in part due to the heavy involvement of the chip maker’s DGX Spark technology in the Trinity’s AI-powered heart.

The multi-hyphenate musician, producer and entrepreneur launched yet another side hustle at CES 2026, the Trinity 3-wheeler. This new micromobility solution made its debut in Nvidia’s Showcase section, in part due to the heavy involvement of the chip maker’s DGX Spark technology in the Trinity’s AI-powered heart.

Why a 3-wheeler? Trinity is set up with two driven wheels at the rear, rather than the familiar Morgan-style set-up. Any inherent instability is countered by a tilting system that will angle the bodywork into the corner. This isn’t new technology; it forms the basis of existing machines like the Danish Carver Cruiser and the Helix Autocycle, and dates back all the way to the Mercedes Benz F400 Carving concept from 2001.

What’s new here is the underlying electronics. Described as an ‘organising brain for life on the move, the compact single-seater is driver-focused, not autonomous. The AI is agentic – in that it acts as a bridge between the driver, their personal information, preferences, schedule, itinerary, likes and dislikes.

‘Trinity represents the future of micromobility - where humans, vehicles, and AI agents work together seamlessly,’ says will.i.am, who is set to teach a class called ‘The Agentic Self’ at Arizona State University this Spring.

The underlying benefits of all that Nvidia processing are meant to transform this mode of personal transport into a form of virtual assistant, ‘managing calendars, errands, communications, and cloud services through natural conversation while the human stays focused on driving.'

The car itself has been developed in collaboration with self-balancing tech from New Hampshire-based DEKA, an R&D firm set up by Segway inventor Dean Kamen. The styling was handling by Ryan Friedlinghaus of Southern California’s cult West Coast Customs, a custom auto shop that has worked with will.i.am on many one-off automotive projects, including a radically overhauled Mercedes-AMG GT and a custom DeLorean.

The project will be launched on Kickstarter, with tech specs that point to a performance orientated machine, with a projected range of 150 miles and the ability to hit 60mph in a motorbike-rivalling two seconds. Unlike the two-seat Helix and Cruiser linked above, Trinity only has room for one.

Projected price is around $30,000 and should the crowdfunding campaign be successful, first deliveries are expected in August 2027, with all manufacturing based in LA’s Boyle Heights.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKd3vgSLqX5egRZQAB6MZP-1920-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 02:58:14.360897

Improved Access to the Grenadines St. Vincent serves as the main gateway to the Grenadines, including Bequia, Canouan, and Mustique.
Access is via St. Vincent followed by a connecting flight, positioning it as a more exclusive option within the Grenadines.
What Travelers Should Know The new nonstop flights operate daily through mid-April, covering the core winter season.","One day on Bequia. Another on Mustique. Then a sail to Mayreau. Or maybe a stop on Union. It’s always been one of the best places for island hopping in the Caribbean. It’s actually getting here that’s always been something of a challenge.

That has been changing, though, in recent years, as the country’s new Argyle airport allowed for the first ever international flights from the mainland US and Canada.

And now, St Vincent has another major new route, another boost for a destination that has been drawing increased attention from travelers over the past year.

Delta Air Lines is now officially operating daily nonstop service between Atlanta and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, adding a major new access point during the peak winter travel season.

Daily Nonstop Service Is Now Operating

The route began operating late last month and runs daily through Apr. 12, 2026. Delta is currently the only U.S. carrier offering nonstop service from Atlanta to St. Vincent.

Flights are operated using Boeing 737-800 aircraft with First Class, Delta Comfort+, and Main Cabin seating.

Why This Route Matters Now

St. Vincent has long been one of the more logistically challenging Caribbean destinations to reach from the continental United States. Daily nonstop service significnatly reduces travel time and simplifies trip planning, particularly for winter travelers.

The timing coincides with increased interest in the destination following recent hotel openings and broader visibility for St. Vincent as both a resort base and a gateway to the Grenadines.

Improved Access to the Grenadines

St. Vincent serves as the main gateway to the Grenadines, including Bequia, Canouan, and Mustique. With Atlanta acting as a major hub, travelers from across the U.S. can now reach the islands with fewer connections and more scheduling flexibility.

Delta has positioned the route as part of its expanded winter Caribbean network, targeting destinations that have historically had limited nonstop U.S. airlift.

Where to Stay in St. Vincent and the Grenadines

Sandals Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Opened in 2024, Sandals’ first resort in St. Vincent has been a major driver of new demand for the island. The adults-only, all-inclusive property is located on Buccament Bay and features beachfront rooms and villas, multiple dining venues, and direct access to the main island’s natural attractions, along with some overwater villas, too.

Young Island Resort

One of the Caribbean’s classic private-island resorts, the old-school Young Island sits just offshore from Kingstown and is accessed by short boat transfer. The resort offers standalone cottages, a long-established restaurant, and a low-density, traditional Caribbean atmosphere that takes you back a few decades in a very charming way.

Bequia Beach Hotel

Located on Bequia, this boutique beachfront hotel is a popular choice for travelers looking for a quieter Grenadines experience. Reaching Bequia requires a short onward flight or ferry from St. Vincent, but the island’s relaxed pace and walkable beaches remain a major draw.

Soho Beach House Canouan

Soho Beach House is located on Canouan, offering a private-club-style experience with beach access, dining, and wellness facilities. Access is via St. Vincent followed by a connecting flight, positioning it as a more exclusive option within the Grenadines.

What Travelers Should Know

The new nonstop flights operate daily through mid-April, covering the core winter season. Delta has not yet announced whether the service will continue beyond the current schedule window.

For travelers who have had St. Vincent on their radar, the launch removes one of the biggest remaining barriers to visiting — and places the island more firmly within reach for the 2026 winter season.

Flights are about $547 roundtrip right now, according to what we found on Google Flights.",https://www.caribjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/st-vincent-delta.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 22:58:44.674185

For Adobe, one community member’s Narrative points to a fair value of about US$585.69 per share, while another sits closer to US$271.93.
Emphasizes that if revenue growth, earnings or AI monetization fall short of these already tempered assumptions, the scope for multiple compression could limit upside from current levels.","Adobe currently trades on a P/E of 19.61x. That sits below the Software industry average P/E of 32.59x and well below the peer group average of 59.17x, which means the market is valuing Adobe’s earnings at a lower multiple than many comparable names. Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio for Adobe is 34.68x, which estimates the P/E that might be reasonable given factors such as its earnings growth profile, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk characteristics.

The Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with industry or peers because it adjusts for Adobe specific fundamentals rather than assuming all software companies deserve similar multiples. With Adobe’s actual P/E of 19.61x sitting below the Fair Ratio of 34.68x, this approach suggests the shares may be trading at a lower valuation on an earnings multiple basis today.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Adobe Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. These let you attach a clear story about Adobe to the numbers you care about, from your assumed fair value through to your revenue, earnings and margin estimates.

A Narrative on Simply Wall St connects three things in one place: the business story you believe, the financial forecast that story implies, and the fair value that follows from those assumptions, all inside an accessible tool on the Community page that is already used by millions of investors.

Once you set up a Narrative, the platform compares your fair value to Adobe’s current share price so you can decide for yourself whether the gap between price and value looks wide enough to consider buying, trimming or simply watching.

Because Narratives update automatically when new information such as news, earnings or guidance is added to the platform, your story and valuation stay current without you needing to rebuild a model each time something changes.

For Adobe, one community member’s Narrative points to a fair value of about US$585.69 per share, while another sits closer to US$271.93. This shows how different investors can look at the same company, apply different revenue, margin and P/E assumptions, and land on very different yet clearly explained views of what the shares might be worth.

For Adobe, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Adobe Narratives:

🐂 Adobe Bull Case

Fair value: US$383.06 per share

Implied discount to fair value: about 12.8% undervalued vs the recent US$333.95 price

Revenue growth assumption: 8.12%

Frames Adobe as a high quality, wide moat business where AI competition is real, but the company still generates strong profitability and maintains a solid balance sheet.

Builds a three-scenario valuation map across bear, base and bull cases, then blends them into a probability-weighted fair value around the mid US$300s.

Assumes revenue growth a little above 8%, profit margins in the high 20s, and a future P/E in the high teens as Adobe settles into life as a mature market leader rather than a high growth outlier.

🐻 Adobe Bear Case

Fair value: about US$271.93 per share

Implied premium to fair value: about 22.8% overvalued vs the recent US$333.95 price

Revenue growth assumption: 6.66%

Focuses on the risk that rising AI-related costs, heavier competition and regulatory pressures compress margins and pull Adobe’s valuation multiple lower over time.

Aligns with the more cautious end of analyst targets, where fair value sits in the low US$270s and assumes slower revenue growth, lower net margins and a mid-teens future P/E.

Emphasizes that if revenue growth, earnings or AI monetization fall short of these already tempered assumptions, the scope for multiple compression could limit upside from current levels.

Put side by side, these Narratives give you a clear sense of the current debate on Adobe, from a supportive view that sees the stock as trading below a reasonable fair value, through to a cautious stance that treats the shares as pricing in more optimism than the numbers justify. If you are building your own view, they can be a useful starting point for deciding which story feels closer to your expectations for growth, margins and the role AI will play in Adobe’s business.

A Dell executive infamously said out loud what AI deniers need to hear: Consumers are not buying PCs ""based on AI."" This was widely reported because of course it was, my industry is terrible. But left unsaid is that Dell doesn't sell that many PCs to consumers, doesn't have an AI strategy for PCs (commercial or consumer), and is such a savvy marketer that it killed off its only solid consumer brand, XPS, last year only to bring it limping back to a market that had lost interest in Dell a decade ago or more anyway. Yeah, we should listen to these people.

Let's look at some numbers.

We're on the cusp of a new round of quarterly earnings reports, but here's what the most recent information about the top PC makers shows us.

Lenovo's Intelligent Devices Group (IDG) is responsible for its PCs, tablets, and phones, and it earned $15.1 billion in the quarter ending September 30, 2025, up 12 percent year-over-year (YOY). Lenovo is decisively in first place in the PC market with a record 25.6 percent market share (unit sales), and it claimed “industry-leading profitability” with over 33 percent of its unit sales now AI PCs. Lenovo is also the world's biggest maker of AI PCs, with 31.1 percent market share. So that seems to be working out pretty well for the company.

HP's PC business earned $10.4 billion in the quarter ending October 31, 2025. Revenues from consumer PC sales were up 10 percent YOY, and HP touted that 30 percent of the PCs it sells now are AI PCs. Looking at its earnings report, I see that net revenues from consumer PC sales were $11 billion, and HP is marketing the hell out of AI. HP, like Lenovo, is building out its own AI chatbot, the HP AI Companion, which is free for customers to use.

Apple reported Mac revenues of $8.7 billion in the quarter ending September 27, a gain of 13 percent YOY. That's pocket change compared to what it earns from the iPhone, but everyone is familiar with how Apple Intelligence is key to Apple's core hardware products, and that it has struggled to get conversational Siri up to its standards. And the reason we know all that is because AI is so important to Apple and its future. Apple doesn't break down consumer and commercial sales, but it's fair to assume the vast majority is consumer-based, or what I could call sales to individuals, not businesses.

So what about Dell? Where does Dell, the sudden genius about consumer PC buying habits and AI, land in all this?

Rock bottom, that's where.

Dell made just $1.9 billion in revenues selling PCs to consumers in the quarter ending October 31, 2025, a decline of 7 percent. Most of Dell's PC revenues come from commercial customers, who want boring, easily locked-down PCs no human being could love.

Spanning judicial, economic, digital, health and fiscal sectors, these measures reflect his strategic foresight, inclusive governance and firm commitment to sustainable development, citizen wellbeing and globally aligned institutional excellence.

Safeguarding family health

The most recent of these landmark measures is Royal Decree No 111/2025 regulating premarital medical examinations, enforced from January 1, 2026. This decree places preventive healthcare at the forefront of social policy by mandating premarital medical screening for every Omani intending to marry, even if the other party is non-Omani and regardless of where the marriage contract is concluded.

Under the decree, accredited health institutions must conduct examinations according to approved scientific and technical standards, inform both parties of their individual results and provide medical counselling when required. Strict confidentiality is guaranteed, with disclosure to third parties prohibited. Upon completion, couples are issued an official certificate, without which marriage officiants are barred from concluding the marriage contract. Penalties for violations include fines and imprisonment, underscoring the seriousness of compliance. This measure highlights the state’s commitment to protecting family stability, reducing health risks and promoting informed marital decisions.

Broadening the revenue base

Royal Decree No 56/2025 introduced the framework for a personal income tax on high-income earners. Scheduled to take effect in January 2028, the tax imposes a modest 5% rate on individuals earning more than RO42,000 annually. Heralded as a pivotal step in fiscal reform, the measure aims to diversify revenue sources and reduce reliance on oil income.

Extensive economic and social studies informed the law’s design – approximately 99% of citizens will remain unaffected due to the high exemption threshold. The framework incorporates deductions and exemptions for education, healthcare, primary housing, inheritance, zakat and charitable donations, reinforcing social justice and fairness. An advanced electronic system developed by the Tax Authority will enable voluntary compliance and accurate income verification. The reform aligns closely with Oman Vision 2040, supporting fiscal sustainability while helping fund the social protection system.

A new era in healthcare

Earlier in 2025, healthcare reform took centre stage with the issuance of two major Royal Decrees. Royal Decree No 43/2025 promulgated the Public Health Law, establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating public health and strengthening coordination between the health sector and other areas of government. Fully aligned with Oman Vision 2040, the law supports inclusive, sustainable health services and provides a reference point for managing public health challenges.

Complementing this was Royal Decree No 44/2025, which established the Transfer and Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissue Regulation Law. Addressing the rising demand for organ transplants, the law underpins the National Organ Transplant Programme and sets out clear, ethical procedures for organ donation during life or after death. It safeguards the rights and safety of donors and recipients, defines institutional responsibilities and ensures adherence to the highest professional standards. Together, these laws mark a transformative chapter in Oman’s healthcare journey, reinforced by growing expertise, public engagement and unwavering royal support.

Legal foundations for the digital age

As Oman advances its digital transformation, Royal Decree No 39/2025 promulgating the Electronic Transactions Law stands out as a cornerstone reform. The law grants full legal recognition to electronic signatures, contracts and documents, placing these on par with traditional paper-based instruments. This alignment with global digital practices modernises Oman’s legal and commercial frameworks and supports the expansion of e-commerce and digital services.

The law also establishes a trust services management committee to regulate service providers and ensure secure digital interactions, while incorporating safeguards to promote inclusivity, particularly for persons with disabilities. By enabling secure, reliable digital transactions, the legislation enhances investor confidence and strengthens Oman’s standing as a regional hub for digital innovation. Its timing and scope complement broader judicial and economic reforms aimed at building a modern, competitive economy.

A transformative judicial milestone

On March 23, 2025 His Majesty Sultan Haitham issued Royal Decree No 35/2025 establishing the Court of Investment and Commerce – a development widely described as transformative for Oman’s judicial and economic landscape. Designed as a specialised judicial authority with exclusive jurisdiction over commercial and investment disputes, the court consolidates expertise and ensures consistency in rulings.

Its jurisdiction spans a wide array of areas, including foreign investments, banking and financial instruments, maritime sales, insurance, bankruptcy, arbitration-related disputes, intellectual property, electronic commercial transactions and public-private contracts. Efficiency lies at the heart of the new court’s design, with strict timelines for rulings, electronic submission of expert reports and the use of secure video systems for remote hearings. These innovations reduce delays, protect assets and align Oman’s judiciary with leading international standards, significantly enhancing the country’s attractiveness as an investment destination.

Reinventing economic zones

Running parallel to judicial reform was Royal Decree No 38/2025 promulgating the Special Economic Zones and Free Zones Law. This legislation harmonises incentives, exemptions and guarantees across zones while offering special privileges for strategic projects. Central to the reform is a one-stop system that enables investors to obtain all approvals, licences and permits through a single streamlined process, significantly reducing bureaucratic hurdles.

The law goes beyond administrative efficiency by linking incentives to employment generation, local content and high-value-added activities, ensuring that investment directly supports economic diversification. A particularly innovative provision allows freehold residential property sales within economic and free zones, encouraging the development of integrated communities and enhancing the long-term appeal of these zones. The reform positions Oman’s economic zones as dynamic engines of sustainable growth.

These Royal Decrees issued over the past year form a cohesive reform narrative – one that begins with individual wellbeing and family health, extends to fiscal resilience and public health, and culminates in a modern judicial and investment ecosystem. Each decree addresses a critical pillar of national life, yet all are unified by a citizen-centred vision.

Together, these measures reaffirm His Majesty Sultan Haitham’s determination to build a future defined by stability, prosperity and opportunity. By aligning national priorities with global best practices, Oman is confidently charting a path towards a resilient, inclusive and competitive future under the wise leadership of His Majesty.",https://www.muscatdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RD.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 19:59:42.672908

INDIANAPOLIS — Eli Lilly and Company and Ventyx Biosciences, Inc., a San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing oral therapies for patients with inflammatory-mediated diseases, today announced entry into a definitive agreement for Lilly to acquire Ventyx.

Ventyx is developing a pipeline of small molecule therapeutics, including NLRP3 inhibitors, designed to treat inflammation across a broad range of disease states with high unmet need. These include opportunities across cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory disorders. The company’s clinical-stage programs target key immune pathways with the goal of offering improved efficacy and safety compared to existing treatments.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” said Daniel M. Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., chief scientific and product officer, and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. “Ventyx’s clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.”

“Our portfolio of class-leading NLRP3 inhibitors modulate residual and chronic inflammation that is now recognized as a major risk factor in a host of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases,” said Raju Mohan, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Ventyx Biosciences. “We believe that Lilly is an ideal strategic partner, with unparalleled resources, a passion for innovative oral drugs and a commitment to advance novel therapies that fill a vast unmet need for patients suffering from these debilitating diseases and disorders.”

Under the terms of the agreement, Lilly will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ventyx for $14.00 per share of common stock in an all-cash transaction (equal to an aggregate equity value of approximately $1.2 billion). The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to approval by Ventyx stockholders and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

The purchase price payable at closing represents a premium of approximately 62% to the 30-day volume-weighted average trading price of Ventyx’s common stock ended on January 5, 2026. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction.

To demonstrate their commitment to the transaction, entities affiliated with New Science Ventures and all directors and officers of Ventyx have signed voting and support agreements whereby they agree to vote to approve the transaction. The shares subject to the agreements represent a total of approximately 10% of Ventyx’s outstanding common stock.

Lilly will determine the accounting treatment of this transaction in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles upon closing. This transaction will thereafter be reflected in Lilly’s financial results and financial guidance.

BofA Securities, Inc. is acting as exclusive financial advisor and Ropes & Gray is acting as legal counsel to Lilly.

“Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates?
To make sure there’s sufficient demand among bond investors, Treasury yields must remain attractive relative to the competition.
Foreign governments accounted for more than 40% of Treasury bond holdings in the early 2010s, up from just over 10% in the mid-1990s, he wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month.
“Foreign governments now make up less than 15% of the overall Treasury market.”","In a note on Saturday, he pointed out that Wall Street estimates for the volume of investment grade debt that’s on the way this year reach as high as $2.25 trillion.

That’s as the AI boom increasingly sends companies, including hyperscalers and adjacent firms, to the bond market to fund massive investments in data centers and other infrastructure.

“The significant increase in hyperscaler issuance raises questions about who will be the marginal buyer of IG paper,” Slok said. “Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates? Or might it come from mortgage purchases, putting upward pressure on mortgage spreads?”

With U.S. debt topping $38 trillion, the federal government has already borrowed $601 billion in the first three months of the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October 2025, according to the latest data from the Congressional Budget Office.

That’s $110 billion less than the deficit during the same period a year earlier as tariffs helped revenue outpace spending. But the Supreme Court could strike down President Donald Trump’s global tariffs soon, and this year’s tax season should see a surge of refunds to account for new tax cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Meanwhile, Trump has vowed to boost defense spending to $1.5 trillion a year from $1 trillion, threatening to further deepen federal budget deficits.

And despite the Federal Reserve’s series of rate cuts this past autumn, Treasury yields remain about where they were in early September, suggesting the government will not see much relief on debt-servicing costs that are also contributing to the overall tally of red ink.

“The bottom line is that the volume of fixed-income products coming to market this year is significant and is likely to put upward pressure on rates and credit spreads as we go through 2026,” Slok said.

To make sure there’s sufficient demand among bond investors, Treasury yields must remain attractive relative to the competition. Failure to draw enough investors raises the risk of so-called fiscal dominance, or when a central bank must step into to finance widening deficits.

That’s what former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned of last weekend, during a panel hosted by the American Economic Association.

“The preconditions for fiscal dominance are clearly strengthening,” she said, noting debt is on a steep upward trajectory toward 150% of GDP over the next three decades.

At the same time, he holders of U.S. debt have shifted drastically over the past decade, tilting more toward profit-driven private investors and away from foreign governments that are less sensitive to prices.

That threatens to turn the U.S. financial system more fragile in times of market stress, according to Geng Ngarmboonanant, a managing director at JPMorgan and former deputy chief of staff to Yellen during her tenure at Treasury.

Foreign governments accounted for more than 40% of Treasury bond holdings in the early 2010s, up from just over 10% in the mid-1990s, he wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month. This reliable bloc of investors allowed the U.S. to borrow vast sums at artificially low rates.

“Those easy times are over,” he warned. “Foreign governments now make up less than 15% of the overall Treasury market.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-637420748-e1768070604614.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-10 20:00:02.344870

See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon.

Recent trading has come after a strong run, with the current US$119.04 share price sitting against a 13.87% 3 month share price return and a much larger 61.33% 1 year total shareholder return, suggesting momentum has been building over time.

If you are comparing Bank of New York Mellon Corporation with other financial names, it can also be useful to widen the lens and look at fast growing stocks with high insider ownership for ideas beyond large established institutions.

So with Bank of New York Mellon Corporation trading at US$119.04, a 61.33% 1 year total return and a modest discount to analyst targets, is there still value left on the table, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: Fairly Valued

At a last close of US$119.04 versus a narrative fair value of US$119.03, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation is effectively aligned with that framework, which leans heavily on technology, digital assets and capital returns to shareholders.

Accelerated investment in digital platforms (including digital asset custody, AI integration, and the NEXEN ecosystem), coupled with strong early adoption, positions BNY Mellon for improved operating leverage and net margin expansion over the coming years, as scalable technology reduces costs and increases cross-selling opportunities.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious how that tech push, fee based services and long term buybacks are wired into the model? The valuation leans on specific growth, margin and multiple assumptions you may want to test for yourself.

Result: Fair Value of $119.03 (ABOUT RIGHT)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, this story can change quickly if fee pressure weighs on high margin services, or if digital asset disruption chips away at BNY's core custody franchise.

Find out about the key risks to this Bank of New York Mellon narrative.

Another View: Multiples Point To A Cushion

While the fair value narrative lands almost exactly on the current US$119.04 share price, the simple P/E picture looks a bit different. BNY trades on 16.6x earnings, compared with 19.3x for the broader US market, 25.9x for the US Capital Markets industry, and a 30.6x peer average. Our fair ratio sits close by at 16.9x. This suggests the market already prices BNY in line with those fundamentals but with less valuation stretch than many peers. The question is whether that cushion feels like comfort or a sign that expectations are already well calibrated.

However, the business is burning a lot of cash and trades at a premium valuation.

Here's why SoundHound AI stock fell in 2025, and whether you should scoop up some shares at these discounted prices.

AI tailwinds and a history of losing money

SoundHound AI has adeptly expanded its voice-based AI technology during the past few years of the AI revolution. It offers products to support customer service, restaurant drive-thrus, car voice systems, and more, winning numerous contracts worldwide across various industries. Its focus on commercial use cases has helped it win contracts when competing with big technology companies.

Revenue is exploding higher. Sales increased 68% year-over-year to $42 million last quarter. Since going public in 2022, revenue has grown cumulatively by over 1,000%.

So why is the stock down? The primary reason is the company's inability to generate a profit while heavily diluting its shareholders. SoundHound AI's free cash flow was negative $111 million over the last twelve months, a figure that has only gotten worse since it became public. On top of this cash drain, the company has a large stock-based compensation program that is diluting shareholders but is not included in cash flow. Shares outstanding are up over 100% since the company went public, which will be a huge drag on long-term returns.

Should you buy SoundHound AI stock?

Even though SoundHound AI's stock collapsed last year, it still trades at a premium price relative to its trailing revenue. With a market capitalization of $5 billion, the stock has a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 32, which is more than 10 times the average of the S&P 500 Index.

A bull may argue that SoundHound AI is growing quickly, which will bring down this P/S ratio. Investors need to remember, though, that this company is failing to generate positive free cash flow and is heavily diluting shareholders with stock-based compensation. Combine this with a high starting valuation, and SoundHound AI stock does not look attractive even after falling 50% in 2025.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2026-01-10 19:00:37.079637

xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic have been rapidly raising more money, adding to the notion of 'aspirational' valuations across the AI startup scene

OpenAI is expected to raise funds at a $750 billion valuation - 50% above its previous, $500 billion estimated valuation.

The jury is still out on whether creators of popular artificial-intelligence chatbots will be able to work out business models that justify their hefty investments. But that hasn't stopped those companies from racking up ever more money in the private market.

Valuations keep rising for some of the biggest AI unicorns, as evidenced by xAI's announcement Tuesday that it had raised $20 billion in a Series E round that exceeded its $15 billion target. CNBC in November reported that the Grok chatbot maker, launched in 2023 by Elon Musk, was expected to close a $15 billion funding round at a $230 billion premoney valuation.

That would mark a premium compared to what xAI was worth last March when it acquired Musk's social-media platform, X. That transaction valued xAI at $80 billion and X, formerly known as Twitter, at $33 billion. xAI has raised a total of $42.1 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks private capital markets.

""It is likely that the venture market is experiencing an AI bubble. The data checks most of the boxes,"" Kyle Stanford, PitchBook's head of research for the U.S. venture market, said in a recent report.

""The market has shown a sharp price increase, the market narrative has become 'AI versus the rest,' and much of the investment is driven by investor envy and fear of missing out on returns,"" Stanford added.

As of last October, ChatGPT creator OpenAI was worth $500 billion and had raised a total $66.4 billion from investors since its inception, according to PitchBook. Anthropic ended 2025 with more than $39 billion raised since it was founded by former OpenAI employees in 2021. In September, Anthropic was valued at $183 billion, or almost three times what it was worth less than a year earlier.

Anthropic, which develops the Claude chatbot, is now in talks to raise $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, or almost twice what it was worth as of its previous round, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. And OpenAI is planning to raise as much as $100 billion at a $750 billion valuation, according to the Journal. Earlier reports had pinned OpenAI's potential value at as much as $830 billion.

""What's really unprecedented is kind of the size of the investment going into the space right now,"" said Andrew Alden, vice president of quantitative research at Forge Global, which operates a marketplace where investors can trade shares of private companies.

Alden pointed to Forge's trading data, which showed that 45% of volume in 2025 was related to AI companies; that compares with 40% in 2024 and just 18% in 2023. Returns on Forge's dedicated AI basket of 19 companies grew 191% in 2025, according to Alden.

""There still needs to be a validation of the business model, and I think that is coming,"" he said - noting that some companies have ""aspirational"" valuations that are very high compared to the revenue they currently generate.

xAI recorded a net loss of $1.46 billion for its September quarter after spending $7.8 billion across the first nine months of 2025, Bloomberg News reported Thursday. And fresh off its latest fundraise, the company said this week that it will invest $20 billion to build its third data center.

xAI's revenue for the three-month period that ended on Sept. 30 amounted to $107 million. That's almost double what was recorded for its June quarter, according to Bloomberg.

Anthropic, which is reportedly a candidate for a public listing, planned to burn almost $3 billion on $4.2 billion in sales in 2025, the Journal reported in November, citing financial documents showed to investors over the summer.

OpenAI doesn't expect to be cash-flow positive until 2030. By then, HBSC analysts have calculated that it could face a funding shortfall of $207 billion.

The company was on pace to burn $9 billion after generating $13 billion in sales in 2025 as of November, according to the Journal, which cited financial documents. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, has said the company was making much more than $13 billion and that revenue was growing ""steeply.""

""Whether we burn $500 million a year or $5 billion or $50 billion a year, I don't care - I genuinely don't,"" Altman said in 2024. ""It's going to be expensive. It's totally worth it.""

A representative for OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment. An inquiry sent to xAI received an automated reply. Anthropic declined to comment.

Much of what AI firms are raising is put to work developing data centers and equipping them with expensive hardware, including AI chips. Public hyperscalers, such as Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT), could collectively spend potentially $2.9 trillion on AI-related capital expenditures through 2028.

And as companies develop their AI models, they're spending more and more to train them, according to Stanford University's latest AI Index report. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC in early 2024 that it could cost up to $1 billion to train AI models that year. He also forecast that spending on training could rise to as much as $10 billion this year.

""I think this is the fundamental problem with generative AI and LLMs today - they are so expensive,"" said investor Michael Burry, of ""The Big Short"" fame, in a Substack debate published Friday. ""It is hard to understand what the profit model is, or what any one model's competitive advantage will be - will it be able to charge more, or run cheaper?

While OpenAI, xAI and Anthropic have some of the deepest pockets among private AI firms, they're far from the only ones benefitting from investor enthusiasm.

Investment in AI accounted for more than half of the $512.6 billion deployed by venture capitalists around the world in 2025, according to data from PitchBook. A year earlier, investments in AI made up 38% of all venture-capital deal value.

""There are parts of the AI ecosystem that are probably in bubbles,"" Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said last month. ""One example would be just seed rounds for startups that basically haven't even got going yet, and they're raising at tens of billions of dollars.""

Heavy investment in such startups has helped more than 50 individuals working on AI companies become billionaires in 2025, according to Forbes. Edwin Chen, whose 6-year-old business Surge AI refines AI models, is the wealthiest of the new class of AI billionaires, worth about $18 billion.

Read more: AI made tech billionaires even richer this year. Here's how much.

Former OpenAI executive Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation last July in one of the largest seed rounds of all time. By November, barely a month after introducing its first product, it was in talks to raise more cash at a $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported.

Companies working on so-called physical AI, such as humanoid robots and driverless vehicles, have also been popular. Figure AI was most recently valued at $39 billion, while the Alphabet-backed robotaxi firm Waymo is reportedly in talks to join the $100 billion club.

Most of the top 10 venture-capital deals of the December quarter involved companies that heavily integrate AI into their businesses, according to PitchBook data. At the top of the leaderboard was Anthropic's deal with Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft, followed by Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos's cash infusion into his physical-AI startup, Project Prometheus.

Fears of an AI bubble have also been prominent in the public markets. Stock-market bulls have argued that there's still room for companies to grow, while more pessimistic investors say that tech-company valuations are too high and could collapse.

""We see evidence of froth in circular investments between leading AI firms and suppliers, [and] concentrated valuations in a few frontier labs, while at the same time, we think the underlying fundamentals remain orders of magnitude stronger than in prior tech bubbles,"" Truist Securities analysts said in a recent note as they initiated coverage on several AI firms, including Palantir Technologies (PLTR).

Don't miss: Big Tech needs a staggering $1.5 trillion to fund the AI boom. This is the complex playbook it's using to get it.

Pre-order opens January 11 for flights departing from February 11. There are separate meals on offer in February and in March:

February: Barbecue platter Smoked brisket and smoked sausage, paired with creamy mac and cheese, crisp coleslaw and a side of pickles, onions and barbecue sauce

March: Chopped brisket sandwich Chopped brisket on a fresh brioche bun, roasted green beans, creamy potato salad and a side of pickles, onion, and barbecue sauce.

Interstellar Barbecue

Note that this is for DFW departures only. It’s not offered on the return. February’s option sounds far better, though do know that barbecue sauce should really just be for dipping. When the barbecue is any good, you shouldn’t be trying to hide the flavor of the meat. That’s what’s wrong with so many other styles of barbecue.

Although two years ago British Airways served barbecue out of Austin and oddly partnered wtih Aaron Franklin on the sauce (they weren’t serving his meat!). Franklin noted, “if you guys are going to be serving it on a plane… you need to hit the sauce pretty hard.”

Pecan Lodge was an elite barbecue destination a decade ago. I haven’t been in years, so can’t say what it’s like today though I note that while it was once #2 in the Texas Monthly Top 50 biennial barbecue rankings, it’s now fallen off that list completely. (The list itself has declined in value, however.) It’s likely fair to say that Pecan Lodge is not considered in the same league as LeRoy & Lewis, InterStellar, or Franklin.

Franklin Barbecue

Dallas just isn’t the epicenter of Texas barbecue. And that seems to be why people still pay attention to Pecan Lodge (and to Terry Black’s in Deep Ellum, even the original in Austin is overrated). A more legit pick would probably be Goldee’s in Fort Worth.

It seems like partnering with Pecan Lodge should mean (1) brisket, the staple of Texas barbecue, and an easier fit than their beef rib, (2) a side of The Hot Mess, a loaded split sweet potato piled with toppings and sauce. This is the thing people associate with Pecan Lodge.

I love to see American experimenting with new food partnerships, and route-specific food options. This is an airline that hasn’t been serving Australian wine on departures out of Sydney. So shifting its catering for a single set of flights could be a real progress.

And announcing short-term options is great, too. For too long the menus on American’s flights just haven’t varied enough. So offering different things every few months could be another sort of progress as well. It seems like it would be easy to extend a DFW-specific menu option to other flights (certainly easier than scaling it out to other stations).

Back in 2014 Delta partnered with Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group and brought Blue Smoke barbecue onboard as a premium-cabin menu on transatlantic JFK flights. It began with London Heathrow and later expanded to other Europe flights. (They’ve more recently done Fox Bros Bar-B-Q as part of their rotating premium-cabin menu, too.)

This was essentially the start of a broader rotation of Union Square Hospitality Group menus on Delta. (Today you can get a Shake Shack burger, for instance.)

On its own I take this as a ‘premium signal’ from American, copying Delta’s early playbook. American itself links it to its premium efforts as well, tying it to serving better coffee (Lavazza) and champagne (Bollinger). So there’s a strong chance this particular effort is the kickoff of something larger.",https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/interstellar-bbq-plate-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 15:00:14.126176

During the third quarter, Peter Thiel's hedge fund sold out of Nvidia and initiated a position in Apple.

Apple's growth has been sluggish throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, especially compared to Nvidia.

Nvidia is cheaper than Apple based on valuation metrics, but that doesn't necessarily make it the safer buy right now.

Peter Thiel is one of the most iconic Silicon Valley investors. The entrepreneur's first claim to fame was serving as a co-founder of PayPal with none other than the then-unknown Elon Musk.

After minting a fortune through his PayPal ownership, Thiel moved into a professional investor role. Perhaps his most lucrative opportunities came from being the first outside capital invested in Facebook (now Meta Platforms) as well as co-founding data analytics specialist Palantir Technologies.

Today, the tech savant manages capital through a hedge fund, called Thiel Macro. According to the fund's most recent 13F filing, Thiel completely exited his position in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) during the third quarter -- selling 537,742 shares.

Interestingly, Thiel swapped his exposure to the most influential player in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena for a stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a stock that Warren Buffett had been trimming prior to his retirement.

Let's dig into what may have influenced these decisions and assess if growth investors should follow Thiel's playbook.

Should you sell Nvidia stock right now?

When OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT on Nov. 30, 2022, Nvidia sported a market capitalization of just $345 billion. As of this writing (Jan. 7), Nvidia's market value is $4.6 trillion -- making it the most valuable company in the world.

While Nvidia's revenue and earnings continue to shatter its own records, underlying activity in the stock suggests investors may be getting a bit leery -- and the rally may finally be fading after three years. Since Nvidia reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter on Nov. 19, 2025, shares have risen by a rather pedestrian 1.7%.

My suspicion is that growth investors are increasingly weighing the impact competition from other GPU designers such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designers like Broadcom could have on Nvidia's trajectory.

Indeed, Nvidia has numerous opportunities beyond AI accelerators and data centers. However, the timeline and significance of any potential upside from emerging applications remain big question marks at the moment.

This is all to say that investors such as Thiel could be anticipating at least a slowdown to Nvidia's momentum in the near term. As such, rotating capital into more predictable businesses like Apple may seem like the smarter move in terms of maintaining healthy risk-adjusted returns for your portfolio.

Why did Peter Thiel buy Apple stock?

There's a strong case to be made that Apple has achieved the least in terms of AI innovation among its megacap tech peers. Nevertheless, most investors may be overlooking the fact that Apple doesn't actually need to develop a new, groundbreaking device in order to be a winner of the AI revolution.

Apple's installed base of active devices is well north of 2 billion. Against this backdrop, Apple can benefit alongside the proliferation of generative AI as the technology becomes increasingly integrated across its consumer hardware lineup as well as a key driver of services revenue from the App Store.

Nvidia's share price ebbs and flows based on the latest AI-related headline and the health of the company is generally gauged on a quarterly basis when earnings are published. The paradox here is that despite blowing Wall Street's expectations out of the water time and again, Nvidia is slowly being perceived as a high-beta stock given its volatility. Beta is a measurement used to determine a company's risk profile.

By contrast, Apple's growth has been sluggish for a couple of years and the company's AI roadmap has been ambiguous at best. While mundane, Apple is still about as blue chip an opportunity as you'll see in the tech industry.

Despite a lackluster top line, Apple's cash-flow generation remains incredibly robust and predictable. Apple may present an investment opportunity with smoother returns compared to a volatile momentum stock like Nvidia.

Is Apple stock a buy right now?

Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 24. Apple trades at a higher premium, boasting a forward P/E ratio of around 32.

Considering Nvidia's revenue and earnings are accelerating much faster than Apple's, in combination with the company's robust outlook relative to the iPhone maker, Nvidia is the ""cheaper"" stock. But that doesn't necessarily make it the better buy at this exact moment.

I think Thiel's recent portfolio management suggests that he thinks a pronounced correction could be in store for traditional growth and momentum stocks. Generally speaking, when sell-offs occur in more volatile positions, investors will redeploy capital elsewhere -- usually into more durable opportunities with resilient business models.

In my eyes, Apple checks off this criteria. So while Apple stock isn't a bargain, it's likely a safe bet right now for investors with a long-term time horizon.

Advertisers seeking to activate Epsilon data on Microsoft Advertising Platform would need to establish commercial relationships with both Microsoft and Epsilon, negotiate data licensing terms, and complete technical integration requirements.
Implications for search advertising ecosystem The Microsoft-Epsilon integration demonstrates how platform-data provider partnerships reshape competitive dynamics in search advertising.
The search advertising market has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years, with Google controlling approximately 90 percent of global search advertising revenue.
Where: The integration operates within Microsoft Advertising Platform across search inventory on Bing, native placements on MSN and Microsoft Start, and display inventory through Microsoft Audience Network.","Microsoft Advertising announced on January 7, 2026, at CES in Las Vegas that Epsilon data has become available on the Microsoft Advertising Platform through a collaboration with Publicis Media Exchange. The partnership, designated Third-Party Search, combines Microsoft's search advertising infrastructure with Epsilon's consumer identity data and PMX's strategic activation expertise to deliver what the companies characterize as a first-of-its-kind approach to audience targeting across search, native, and display inventory.

The integration enables advertisers to activate Epsilon's consumer insights directly within Microsoft's advertising ecosystem. Epsilon, acquired by Publicis Groupe on July 2, 2019, for $3.95 billion after tax step-up, operates as the holding company's core data technology platform with identity resolution capabilities spanning billions of consumer records.

According to the announcement by Russ Lynn, Agency Director North America at Microsoft Advertising, and Edgar Rodriguez, SVP Partner Management at Epsilon, the collaboration delivers ""a new, first-of-its-kind approach to audience solutions that outperform traditional targeting models."" The system leverages Epsilon's consumer data to identify high-value audiences across Microsoft's advertising inventory with what the companies describe as unprecedented accuracy and scale.

Early testing demonstrates substantial performance improvements over conventional targeting approaches. A pilot campaign in the travel vertical achieved two times higher return on ad spend compared to traditional in-market audiences. The same campaign identified 42 percent net-new targetable audience, converting travelers not previously reached through other first-party audience segments.

Technical infrastructure and data integration

The Third-Party Search framework operates by integrating Epsilon's proprietary identity data with Microsoft Advertising Platform's targeting capabilities. Epsilon maintains comprehensive consumer profiles derived from multiple data sources including purchase history, demographic information, lifestyle indicators, and behavioral signals across digital and offline channels.

Microsoft's advertising ecosystem encompasses search inventory on Bing, native advertising placements across MSN and Microsoft Start, and display inventory distributed through Microsoft Audience Network. The platform serves advertisements across desktop, mobile, and connected television environments, reaching what Microsoft characterizes as hundreds of millions of monthly active users.

Epsilon's data infrastructure relies on COREid, the company's proprietary identity resolution technology that links consumer records across devices, browsers, and platforms. This system creates persistent identifiers that enable advertisers to recognize and target specific consumer segments even as individuals move between environments and devices.

The integration maintains privacy compliance through what the companies describe as secure data handling protocols. Epsilon's identity graph operates under privacy frameworks including CCPA, GDPR, and industry self-regulatory guidelines, according to the company's technical documentation. The system applies data governance controls that restrict access to individual-level information while enabling aggregate audience targeting.

Travel pilot campaign results and methodology

The travel vertical pilot campaign provides concrete performance metrics demonstrating the integration's capabilities. The test compared campaigns using Epsilon-powered targeting against traditional in-market audience segments, which typically rely on behavioral signals like search query patterns, website visits, and content consumption related to travel categories.

The 42 percent net-new audience metric indicates Epsilon's data identified travelers that Microsoft's standard audience signals had not flagged as high-intent prospects. This expansion suggests Epsilon's offline purchase data, loyalty program information, and cross-channel behavioral tracking captures consumer segments that search behavior alone misses.

The two times higher ROAS improvement represents substantial efficiency gains. If a baseline campaign generated $2 in revenue for every $1 spent, the Epsilon-enhanced targeting would deliver $4 in revenue per advertising dollar. The announcement attributed these results to ""significant efficiency gains and bookings,"" though specific booking volume data was not disclosed.

Travel advertising represents a particularly valuable test case for precision targeting capabilities. The vertical involves high consideration purchases with long planning cycles, multiple research touchpoints, and significant price sensitivity. Travelers frequently research destinations, compare pricing across multiple dates and routes, and consume substantial content before converting. Epsilon's data potentially identifies consumers based on historical travel patterns, credit card spending in travel categories, and loyalty program participation that search queries alone would not surface.

Industry context and competitive positioning

The Microsoft-Epsilon integration arrives as search advertising faces attribution challenges from AI-powered answer engines. Google's implementation of AI Overviews and Gemini-powered search features has created traffic concerns for publishers and advertisers, with some reports indicating substantial declines in click-through rates from search results pages to destination websites.

Microsoft has positioned Bing as an AI-native search experience since integrating ChatGPT-powered features in February 2023. The company's approach emphasizes conversational search interactions and direct answers within the search interface, potentially reducing traditional advertising inventory visibility. Third-party data integration may help compensate for reduced search signal quality as AI features alter user behavior patterns.

Epsilon has expanded partnerships across major advertising platforms, including integrations with Pinterest, Amazon DSP, and programmatic exchanges. The company's March 16, 2024, partnership with Proximic by Comscore added contextual data capabilities, enabling advertisers to combine identity-based targeting with content adjacency controls.

Publicis Groupe has invested heavily in identity resolution capabilities following the Epsilon acquisition. The company announced plans to acquire Lotame in March 2025, combining Epsilon's 250 million consumer profiles with Lotame's 2.3 billion global identifiers. These acquisitions position Publicis Media Exchange as a significant data intermediary capable of activating proprietary identity assets across multiple advertising platforms.

Clean room technology has emerged as critical infrastructure for secure data collaboration in advertising. Epsilon operates clean room environments that enable advertisers to combine first-party data with Epsilon's proprietary datasets without exposing individual customer records. The Microsoft integration likely operates through similar privacy-preserving architecture, though technical implementation details were not disclosed in the announcement.

Publicis Media Exchange activation strategy

Publicis Media Exchange serves as the strategic activation layer connecting Epsilon's data capabilities with Microsoft's advertising inventory. PMX operates as Publicis Media's programmatic trading desk and audience management platform, executing campaigns across display, video, native, audio, and connected television channels for holding company agencies including Zenith, Starcom, Spark Foundry, and Blue 449.

The collaboration positions PMX clients with exclusive early access to Epsilon-powered Microsoft audiences. This arrangement creates competitive differentiation for Publicis Media agencies in new business pitches and client retention, particularly for categories where precision targeting drives substantial performance improvements.

PMX has established direct integrations with major advertising platforms including Google Display & Video 360, Amazon DSP, The Trade Desk, and Yahoo DSP. The Microsoft-Epsilon partnership extends this portfolio with identity-enriched search targeting capabilities that competitors cannot replicate without similar first-party data partnerships.

The travel pilot campaign methodology suggests PMX played an active role in audience strategy and campaign execution rather than simply providing media buying services. The 42 percent net-new audience finding indicates PMX worked with the client to map existing audience segments, identify coverage gaps, and test Epsilon data's incremental reach. This consultative approach positions PMX as a strategic partner rather than a commodity media buyer.

Data partnership economics and market dynamics

Third-party data partnerships typically involve cost-per-thousand-impression fees charged when advertisers activate external audience segments. Industry standard third-party data CPMs range from $0.75 to $2.50 depending on data provider, audience segment specificity, and vertical category, according to Microsoft Advertising's published rate cards.

Premium identity-based segments command higher CPMs than behavioral or contextual targeting alternatives. Epsilon's proprietary consumer data, derived from credit card transactions, loyalty programs, and direct customer relationships, represents higher-value inventory than inferred behavioral signals. The travel pilot's two times ROAS improvement would justify substantial data costs if those fees remained below 50 percent of the efficiency gains.

Microsoft benefits from the partnership through increased advertiser spending on its platform and potential user data enhancement. Search query logs, click behavior, and conversion patterns from Epsilon-targeted campaigns provide training data for Microsoft's own audience modeling systems. Over time, these signals could improve Microsoft's native audience products even for advertisers not purchasing Epsilon data.

Publicis Media Exchange captures value through improved campaign performance that strengthens client relationships and potentially justifies higher agency fees or performance bonuses. The holding company's ownership of Epsilon creates structural incentive to drive data adoption across Publicis Media clients, with increased Epsilon revenue flowing to the parent company regardless of which agency entity executes campaigns.

The competitive dynamics disadvantage independent agencies and advertisers working outside Publicis Media. While Epsilon theoretically makes data available through multiple distribution channels, the Microsoft integration announcement emphasizes PMX's strategic role and does not specify whether non-Publicis advertisers can access Epsilon audiences on Microsoft Advertising Platform through other agency partners or direct relationships.

Audience targeting evolution and privacy considerations

The Third-Party Search collaboration represents broader industry movement toward identity-based targeting as traditional signal sources degrade. Browser restrictions on third-party cookies, Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework, and privacy regulations have reduced advertisers' ability to track users across websites and applications without explicit consent.

Search advertising historically relied on query-based targeting and website visitation signals captured through platform pixels. A user searching for ""Hawaii vacation packages"" demonstrates clear commercial intent without requiring cross-site tracking. However, query volume represents only a fraction of potential customers. Many consumers research travel through social media, read review sites, and consume video content without generating search queries that advertisers can target.

Epsilon's data enables Microsoft to reach these consumers based on offline indicators like credit card spending at airlines, hotel loyalty program enrollment, or previous travel booking patterns captured through Epsilon's retail and financial services partnerships. This approach extends search advertising's addressable market beyond users actively generating platform signals.

Privacy advocates have questioned whether such data practices genuinely protect consumer interests. The Federal Trade Commission warned on November 13, 2024, that data clean rooms present ""complicated privacy implications"" despite marketing claims emphasizing privacy protection. The FTC noted that clean rooms enable data sharing between companies that consumers might not expect, even when individual-level records remain encrypted.

Epsilon's data collection practices rely on consumer relationships with brands, retailers, and financial institutions that may not have explicitly disclosed advertising uses. Credit card issuers typically include data sharing provisions in terms of service agreements, but consumers rarely understand how transaction histories inform advertising targeting. The degree to which Epsilon's data practices align with consumer privacy expectations remains subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny.

Implementation and availability

The announcement did not specify commercial availability timelines for Microsoft Advertising clients beyond Publicis Media Exchange. Microsoft Advertising typically deploys new features through phased rollouts, beginning with beta testing among select advertisers before general availability.

Advertisers seeking to activate Epsilon data on Microsoft Advertising Platform would need to establish commercial relationships with both Microsoft and Epsilon, negotiate data licensing terms, and complete technical integration requirements. For Publicis Media clients, PMX handles these operational complexities as part of standard media buying services.

Microsoft Advertising Platform provides self-service and managed service options for campaign execution. Self-service advertisers access the platform through Microsoft Advertising web interface, where they can create campaigns, select targeting parameters, set bids, and monitor performance. Managed service clients work with Microsoft account teams who provide strategic guidance and hands-on campaign optimization.

The travel pilot campaign's success metrics will influence adoption patterns across other vertical categories. Travel advertising's strong results may not translate directly to retail, automotive, financial services, or other sectors with different customer journey patterns and conversion behaviors. Advertisers in these categories would need to conduct their own testing to validate Epsilon data's effectiveness for their specific use cases.

Microsoft has historically positioned itself as a privacy-forward alternative to Google's advertising ecosystem, emphasizing user control and data transparency. The Epsilon partnership introduces third-party data elements that complicate this positioning, potentially creating tension with Microsoft's stated privacy commitments. How Microsoft communicates data usage policies to consumers and advertisers will influence perception of the partnership's privacy implications.

Implications for search advertising ecosystem

The Microsoft-Epsilon integration demonstrates how platform-data provider partnerships reshape competitive dynamics in search advertising. Google maintains proprietary user data from Chrome browser usage, Android device data, Google Maps location tracking, YouTube viewing behavior, and Gmail engagement signals. This integrated data ecosystem enables sophisticated audience targeting that Microsoft historically could not match using Bing search signals alone.

By partnering with Epsilon, Microsoft gains access to consumer identity data that partially compensates for its smaller user base and limited first-party data assets. However, the partnership structure creates dependencies that Google avoids through vertical integration. Microsoft must share revenue with Epsilon and relies on a third party for critical targeting capabilities rather than controlling the entire data infrastructure.

Google has faced regulatory pressure to limit data integration across its properties, particularly in Europe where competition authorities have questioned whether combining user data from multiple services creates unfair competitive advantages. Microsoft's partnership model might face less regulatory scrutiny because data combination occurs through commercial agreements rather than single-company data aggregation.

The search advertising market has experienced substantial consolidation in recent years, with Google controlling approximately 90 percent of global search advertising revenue. Microsoft's Bing accounts for roughly 3 percent market share in the United States, limiting its ability to invest in data infrastructure at Google's scale. Strategic partnerships with data providers like Epsilon represent a viable alternative strategy that leverages external assets rather than attempting to build competitive capabilities organically.

Advertiser response to the Third-Party Search collaboration will depend on whether Epsilon-enhanced targeting delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse campaign types and whether data costs remain justified by efficiency gains. The travel pilot's strong results provide encouraging initial evidence, but sustained adoption requires proof that benefits extend beyond single-vertical testing environments.

Summary

Who: Microsoft Advertising partnered with Publicis Media Exchange and Epsilon to launch Third-Party Search, a data integration enabling precision audience targeting. Russ Lynn, Agency Director North America at Microsoft Advertising, and Edgar Rodriguez, SVP Partner Management at Epsilon, announced the collaboration. Publicis Groupe owns Epsilon following a $3.95 billion acquisition completed July 2, 2019.

What: The integration makes Epsilon's consumer identity data available on Microsoft Advertising Platform for targeting across search, native, and display inventory. The system combines Microsoft's advertising reach with Epsilon's proprietary consumer insights and PMX's activation expertise. A travel vertical pilot campaign achieved two times higher return on ad spend compared to traditional in-market audiences and identified 42 percent net-new targetable audience not previously reached through other first-party segments.

When: Microsoft Advertising announced the partnership on January 7, 2026, at CES in Las Vegas. The travel pilot campaign preceded the public announcement, though specific testing dates were not disclosed. Commercial availability beyond Publicis Media Exchange clients remains unspecified.

Where: The integration operates within Microsoft Advertising Platform across search inventory on Bing, native placements on MSN and Microsoft Start, and display inventory through Microsoft Audience Network. Epsilon's identity data derives from consumer relationships across retail, financial services, and loyalty programs spanning offline and digital channels. Publicis Media Exchange manages strategic activation for holding company agency clients.",https://ppc.land/content/images/size/w1200/2026/01/Epsilon-Data.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:59:47.017749

For defense investors, it's not so much the ending of a calendar year that's important, but the ending of a fiscal quarter. Because every time a quarter ends, there's a mad dash at the Pentagon to shovel out a last few spadefuls of cash, in the form of big-ticket defense contracts. It's a race against the clock (or the calendar) to ensure every last cent of funds already approved by Congress goes to the programs that need funding.

And for giant defense contractors like Boeing (BA +3.15%), it's a chance to cash in.

$12.8 billion for Boeing -- or with luck, $17.5 billion

And boy, oh boy, did Boeing ever cash in last month. On Dec. 29, Boeing won each of the two biggest Pentagon contracts awarded. For $4.2 billion, Boeing was tasked with providing ""E-4B contractor logistic service"" to the U.S. Air Force in fiscal 2026 (which ends Sept. 30, 2026).

Then, for $8.6 billion, Boeing won an order to build and deliver at least 25 new F-15IA aircraft to the Israeli Air Force, with an option for 25 more. Seeing as $8.6 billion would imply an MSRP of $343 million per plane (which is quite a high price for a fourth-generation fighter jet), it's likely Boeing will only receive the full $8.6 billion if Israel exercises its option and buys all 50 F-15s. But even if it doesn't, even if Israel only takes the initial 25, that's still a $4.3 billion contract for Boeing, minimum -- and $8.5 billion total from the two contracts.

Not bad for a day's work.

(Just two days later, by the way, Boeing would win another $2.7 billion for ""post-production support"" on AH-64 Apache helicopters for the U.S. Army. Add in another $2 billion for a Dec. 23 contract for B-52 commercial engine replacement, and Boeing may have cleared as much as $17.5 billion in new revenue in just over a week.)

What does it mean for investors?

All four of these contracts, by the way, fall under the aegis of Boeing's Defense, Space, and Security (BDS) business. Combined, they add up to about 73% of all the revenue that business segment generated in all of 2024.

Why is this significant? Well, consider that while BDS has had its issues, notably with the Starliner spacecraft that it produces, which still isn't cleared for use in human spaceflight, BDS is at least profitable today.

It's not very profitable, earning less than a 2% operating profit margin through the three quarters of 2025 that have already been reported. Still, just being profitable at all is more than Boeing can say about its marquee commercial aircraft division, which continues to lose money at a rate of nearly $8.6 billion per year.

What else does this mean for investors?

Another fact worth highlighting for investors may be less immediately obvious. Re-read my description of those four contracts described above. What do you notice?

One thing you might notice is that only one of the four contracts (the F-15 sale) is actually a contract for Boeing to produce and sell aircraft. The other three are for (1) running logistics for E-4B airborne command centers, (2) support of Apache helicopters, and (3) replacing engines on B-52 bombers.

All three of these activities relate to services the aerospace company provides to its aircraft after they're sold. Money Boeing gets without having to win a hard-fought competition to make a sale to a customer. Money Boeing will get almost by default, by virtue of being the company that built the aircraft in the first place.

If you suspect revenue won in this manner might be just a wee bit more profitable for Boeing than the margins it makes when having to win a bidding war, well, you'd be right. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing booked $15.7 billion in parts, maintenance, modifications, and logistics services under its global services business. This is the smallest of Boeing's business divisions -- but by far the most profitable, earning an operating margin of 18.6%.

All of which is to say: When researching Boeing, and deciding whether you might want to buy Boeing stock, don't necessarily ignore the big, headline-grabbing contract wins that Boeing announces. But do keep in mind:

Boeing doesn't make its money when it wins a contract. Boeing makes its money in the years after winning the contract. And that makes Boeing Global Services by far the most important business segment at Boeing.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849439%2Ff-15e-fighter-jet-in-flight.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-10 17:00:22.917883

Tech companies have also been chasing the next big product following the smartphone and think AI could be key to finding it.","Las Vegas, NV (CNN) — Robots took over the floor at the biggest technology show of the year: I watched a towering humanoid robot march forward, spin its head and wave at an excited crowd. Then I almost bumped into a four-legged doglike robot behind me.

They’re just a couple of the many robots I encountered this week designed for a range of purposes, from playing chess to performing spinal surgery. These are common occurrences on the Las Vegas Convention Center’s show floor during CES, which wrapped on Friday. Every January, companies from around the world gather to flaunt new technologies, products and services.

The show is just as much spectacle as it is substance; many of the most eye-catching wares either haven’t come to fruition (like flying cars) or are wildly expensive and impractical (think TVs that cost tens of thousands of dollars). But CES provides a glimpse into the bets being made by industry giants like Nvidia, Intel, Amazon and Samsung.

AI once again dominated the conference. Companies showed off everything from humanoid robots they claim will staff factories to refrigerators you can open with your voice to the next-generation chips that will power it all. CES, in some ways, turned the Strip into a bubble of its own, shielded from AI skepticism.

CNN asked a handful of tech executives at CES about an AI bubble and how it might impact their businesses. Some said their businesses aren’t relevant to the bubble concerns, while others expressed optimism about AI’s potential and said they are focused on building products that show it.

“We’re in the earliest stage of what’s possible. So when I hear we’re in a bubble, I’m like… This isn’t a fad,” said Panos Panay, Amazon’s devices and services chief. “It’s not going to pass.”

Growing concerns of an AI bubble

Tech companies poured more than $61 billion into data center investments in 2025, according to S&P Global, fueling concerns that investments may be far outpacing demand.

And investments are only expected to grow, with Goldman Sachs reporting that AI companies are estimated to invest more than $500 billion in capital expenditures this year. Julien Garran, researcher and partner for research firm MacroStrategy Partnership, said in a report last year that the AI bubble is 17 times bigger than the dot com bubble.

Most of the concerns around an AI bubble have centered on investments in data centers built for AI tasks that are too power-hungry for devices like laptops and smartphones to handle alone. Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom and the company at the center of the bubble debate, announced at CES that the next version of its computing platform that powers those data centers is arriving in the second half of this year.

When asked about the AI bubble, executives from chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm pointed to their respective companies’ efforts to improve how computers process AI tasks locally rather than in the cloud.

Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones and other products, announced last year that it’s expanding into data centers. But that represents a very small part of its business.

“As far as we’re concerned, where we operate is not where the bubble conversation exists,” Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, told CNN.

Intel is focused on products that are important to its consumers, like chips that boost laptop performance, rather than making a big bet “that takes a lot of investment that may or may not make it,” said its client computing group head, Jim Johnson.

CK Kim, executive vice president and head of Samsung’s digital appliances business, said in an interview through an interpreter that it’s not for him to say whether the industry is in an AI bubble. He added that the company is more focused on whether AI is bringing value to consumers.

AI and the hunt for the next big thing

What that “value” looks like is exactly what the thousands of exhibitors at CES tried to demonstrate this week. Humanoid robots were a big part of that equation for companies like Nvidia, Intel, Hyundai and Qualcomm, all of which announced new tech to power human-shaped robots.

Boston Dynamics and Hyundai debuted Atlas, a humanoid robot developed in partnership with Google’s DeepMind AI division designed for industrial work like order fulfillment. It’ll be deployed to Google DeepMind and Hyundai’s Robotics Metaplant Applications center in the coming months, and additional customers will adopt it in early 2027.

“With one investment, we can explore any application in the world, from industrial use cases to retail use cases to home use cases,” Aya Durbin, who leads Boston Dynamics’ humanoid application product strategy, said in an interview at Hyundai’s booth when asked what’s driving the interest in humanoid robots. (Hyundai owns a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics.)

Tech companies have also been chasing the next big product following the smartphone and think AI could be key to finding it. At CES, a wave of companies introduced discrete listening devices that can record conversations or voice notes. These products included AI jewelry from a startup called Nirva, the Index 01 ring from smartwatch maker Pebble and the now Amazon-owned wristband from Bee.

Speaking to gadgets is often faster than typing, but Amazon and Nirva also see their devices as another means to gather data that can provide insights about a user’s life, though doing so will surely raise privacy concerns.

Business leaders seem to agree that AI is here to stay — even for those like Pete Erickson, CEO of tech events and education company Modev, who said the industry is indeed in a bubble.

But Erickson also believes AI is “just a part of our lives” now.

“I don’t think it’s going anywhere,” he said.

Lilly rode explosive GLP-1 drug demand to 53.9% revenue growth. Johnson & Johnson leaned on diversification across medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer health to post 6.8% growth.

GLP-1 Momentum Versus Diversified Stability

Lilly’s quarter centered on its diabetes and obesity franchise. Revenue hit $17.6 billion, driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound demand that management described as supply-constrained rather than demand-constrained. Net income of $5.6 billion jumped 480% year over year, as operating margin expanded to 48.3%. Gross margin reached 82.9%, reflecting the pricing power and manufacturing efficiency of blockbuster biologics.

Johnson & Johnson’s $24.0 billion in revenue came from a broader base. Medical device sales benefited from elective procedure volume recovery. Pharmaceutical revenue grew on newer immunology and oncology drugs, though legacy products faced biosimilar pressure. The 69.6% gross margin and 30.2% operating margin reflect a more complex cost structure spanning manufacturing, distribution, and regulatory compliance across multiple product categories. Net income of $5.2 billion rose 91% year over year, driven partly by one-time gains visible in its Q1 2025 blowout of $4.54 EPS against $2.26 expected.

Metric Lilly Johnson & Johnson Revenue Growth 53.9% YoY 6.8% YoY Operating Margin 48.3% 30.2% Net Income Growth 480% YoY 91% YoY R&D Spending $4.1B $3.7B

One Franchise Versus Portfolio Breadth

Lilly’s strategy concentrates risk and reward in a single therapeutic area. GLP-1 drugs now define the company’s valuation and growth trajectory. Management invested $4.1 billion in R&D during the quarter, much directed toward expanding manufacturing capacity and developing next-generation obesity treatments. The forward P/E of 33.78 reflects confidence that demand will sustain through patent cliffs and competitive entries.

Johnson & Johnson spreads exposure across devices, pharmaceuticals, and international markets. The company spent $3.7 billion on R&D allocated across oncology, immunology, cardiovascular devices, and surgical robotics. This diversification limits upside but cushions against single-product risk. The forward P/E of 18.05 and 2.45% dividend yield position J&J as a defensive holding rather than a growth bet.

Oral Competition and Manufacturing Scale

The next inflection point for Lilly involves oral GLP-1 competition. Novo Nordisk’s oral Wegovy approval in December 2025 triggered sustained Reddit discussion, with one thread generating 168 upvotes and comments noting the shift from injections to pills could reshape patient preferences. Lilly must prove its injectable franchise can hold share as oral alternatives scale.

Johnson & Johnson faces different tests. Device segment growth depends on hospital capital spending, which remains uneven. Pharmaceutical revenue needs newer drugs to offset biosimilar erosion on older biologics.

Why I Lean Toward Lilly Despite the Premium

I would choose Lilly for exposure to a transformational drug category that still has room to run. The 480% earnings growth and 48.3% operating margin suggest the GLP-1 franchise is hitting scale efficiently. The P/E of 53.22 looks steep, but the PEG ratio of 1.01 indicates growth justifies the multiple. Oral competition is real, but Lilly’s manufacturing lead and pipeline depth give it time to adapt.

Johnson & Johnson fits a different investor. If you prioritize income and stability over growth, the 2.45% yield and diversified revenue base make sense. The stock gained 44.84% over the past year, but long-term returns lag dramatically. Lilly delivered 587.71% over five years versus J&J’s 51.34%.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry31-0VG.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:03:12.569381

The HP EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC is expected to be available on HP.com in March.","HP (Hewlett-Packard) has unveiled the EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC, a remarkably slim and lightweight keyboard with an integrated computer system, scheduled for release in March this year.

The EliteBoard G1a measures just 17 millimetres in thickness and weighs 630 grammes (1.4 pounds, making it roughly half the weight of a conventional laptop. Designed for mobility, the device supports external 4K monitor connectivity and offers a battery life of up to 3.5 hours per charge.

According to HP, the concept for the all-in-one keyboard was born from observing hybrid work trends. Designers noticed that many users connect their laptops to external monitors only to close the laptop lid immediately. This led to the question: ""If an external monitor is already being used, why not put the computer inside the keyboard?""

The hardware distinguishes itself from standard mini personal computers (PCs) through its high level of customisability. Users can remove the back cover to swap or upgrade components, including DDR5 SODIMM RAM, M.2 NVMe SSDs, batteries, speakers and fans. The keyboard panel itself is also spill-resistant and replaceable.

The American tech company will offer the device in two configurations. One features a fixed USB-C cable but includes an additional USB4 port and a bundled wireless mouse. The second variant offers a detachable USB-C cable for greater flexibility.

To appeal to professional typists, the EliteBoard G1a features tuned key travel to replicate a desktop experience and includes a full numpad. This positioning aims to provide a desktop-grade feel in a highly portable format for off-site work.

However, the device's ultra-slim profile presents certain practical challenges. Despite its portability, the lack of a built-in display means users must still carry a portable monitor. Furthermore, the limited 3.5-hour battery life and the presence of only two USB-C ports may necessitate the use of additional docks or power banks.

Discover how International Business Machines positions its AI and hybrid cloud portfolio

In the latest trading session, International Business Machines stock changed hands close to the mid point of its recent band, with only a modest move compared with the broader tech sector. Over the past five trading days the shares have essentially moved sideways, oscillating within a narrow percentage range around the current quote. Short term traders are seeing more noise than signal, while long term investors take comfort from the fact that the stock has not broken below recent support levels.

Looking at the five day performance, International Business Machines has posted small alternating gains and losses, netting out to only a marginal move by the end of the week. Intraday swings have remained contained, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears have been willing or able to seize control. This muted action stands in contrast to the past three months, where the stock has advanced at a solid double digit clip from its autumn base, drawing increasing attention from income oriented investors who also want some AI exposure.

Zooming out, the 90 day trend remains constructive. From its early quarter levels, International Business Machines has climbed meaningfully, outpacing the broader value oriented indices while lagging the highest growth AI names. The stock currently trades closer to the upper half of its 52 week range, sitting below its recent 52 week high but comfortably above the 52 week low. This positioning reflects cautious optimism. Investors are willing to price in progress on cloud and AI driven revenues, yet they are not ready to award IBM the premium multiples reserved for pure play hyperscalers or software as a service leaders.

On a technical level, the share price is consolidating after a multi month advance. Key moving averages on the daily chart have flattened, confirming this pause in momentum. Volume has tapered off compared with the spikes seen during earlier rallies, reinforcing the sense that the market is catching its breath. If the price can hold above nearby support and eventually re test the 52 week high, the current band may be remembered as a healthy consolidation. If support gives way on heavy volume, it will instead be read as the exhaustion of the latest leg up.

One-Year Investment Performance

What if an investor had bought International Business Machines stock exactly one year ago and simply held through every AI headline, every macro scare and every earnings call since then? The answer is quietly encouraging. Based on the closing price from one year back compared with the latest last close, IBM shares have delivered a solid percentage gain in the high single digits to low double digits, before dividends. Factor in the company’s hefty cash payout and the total return edges higher, turning what could have been a sleepy position into a respectably performing core holding.

To put this into concrete terms, imagine a hypothetical investor who deployed 10,000 dollars into IBM stock at the closing price one year ago. At today’s last close, that stake would now be worth meaningfully more, translating into a profit of several hundred to over a thousand dollars on paper, depending on the precise purchase level within that day’s trading range. Add in the dividends collected over the period and the overall return climbs further. The ride has not been smooth, with pullbacks during broader tech risk offs and bursts of enthusiasm around AI announcements, but the net result over twelve months is clearly positive.

Emotionally, that kind of steady if unspectacular gain can be deceptively powerful. It rewards patience without the adrenaline spikes that come with chasing high beta momentum trades. For a dividend investor, IBM has done what it was expected to do: throw off consistent income while gradually appreciating in price. For a growth oriented trader, the same chart looks tame compared with faster moving AI names, yet even they have to acknowledge that compounding respectable single digit to low double digit annual gains can be a winning strategy over time, particularly when backed by a fortress balance sheet.

Recent Catalysts and News

Recent days have brought a steady stream of incremental news rather than a single game changing headline for International Business Machines. Earlier this week, several tech and business outlets highlighted IBM’s continued push into enterprise generative AI, anchored by its watsonx platform. Coverage from sources such as CNET, TechRadar and Business Insider underscored IBM’s strategy of embedding AI capabilities into existing enterprise workflows rather than chasing consumer oriented chatbots. The company has been promoting reference wins with large financial institutions and industrial clients, signaling that AI is moving from pilot projects to production workloads inside its customer base.

Around the same time, financial media including Bloomberg, Reuters and Yahoo Finance focused on IBM’s positioning ahead of its upcoming earnings release. Commentators pointed out that the stock has already enjoyed a re rating on the back of AI optimism over the previous quarter, which raises the bar for the next set of numbers. Analysts are watching closely for signs that software and consulting segments tied to hybrid cloud and AI can offset slower, legacy oriented infrastructure revenues. Any upside surprise on recurring software revenue or bookings tied explicitly to watsonx and Red Hat could give the shares fresh momentum. Conversely, a conservative outlook or soft free cash flow guidance could quickly cool the recent enthusiasm.

Investor attention has also turned to IBM’s ongoing portfolio reshaping. In the past few days, commentary in outlets such as Forbes and Investopedia revisited the longer term impact of the earlier Kyndryl spin off and the more recent focus on higher margin software and consulting lines. The narrative emerging across these pieces is that IBM is finally being rewarded, at least partially, for a strategic pivot that took years to execute. However, several columnists caution that competition from hyperscalers and best of breed software vendors remains intense, and that IBM must prove it can win new workloads instead of simply protecting its installed base.

Importantly, there have been no major negative surprises in the past week. No sudden management reshuffles, no unexpected legal settlements and no abrupt changes to capital allocation have hit the tape. In the absence of shock events, the stock’s day to day moves have been dictated largely by shifting expectations around AI adoption speed, enterprise IT budgets and interest rate trajectories. This quiet backdrop aligns neatly with the stock’s consolidation on the chart, reinforcing the impression of a calm before whatever catalyst earnings and macro data will next provide.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street’s view on International Business Machines over the past month has been nuanced rather than unanimously bullish or bearish. Several major investment banks have updated their models recently, and their stance helps explain the stock’s relatively tight trading band. According to recent research notes reported by outlets such as Bloomberg and Reuters, banks including Morgan Stanley and UBS currently sit in the neutral camp with equal weight or hold ratings, arguing that the shares are fairly valued relative to near term growth prospects. Their price targets cluster only modestly above the current quote, implying limited upside in the absence of clear evidence that AI can accelerate revenue growth.

On the more constructive side, firms like Bank of America and Deutsche Bank have reiterated buy or overweight ratings in the last few weeks, highlighting IBM’s rising mix of software and the durability of its cash flows. Their published targets stand noticeably higher than the prevailing market price, suggesting that they see room for multiple expansion if IBM can deliver consistent mid single digit revenue growth combined with disciplined cost control. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, for their part, have maintained a more cautious tone, keeping neutral ratings while tweaking targets in line with sector wide revaluations. In aggregate, the consensus across the street lands around a hold, with a modestly positive skew driven by those who believe in IBM’s AI execution.

For investors, the message is clear. This is not a battleground stock where bears are calling for collapse and bulls are promising moonshots. Instead, analysts are effectively saying that IBM is a stable, cash generative name where upside depends on the pace at which AI and hybrid cloud initiatives can translate into tangible top line acceleration. Dividend yield and balance sheet strength form the floor under the shares, while skepticism around IBM’s ability to out innovate younger rivals caps the ceiling, at least in current models.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Looking ahead, the fate of International Business Machines stock over the coming months will hinge on whether the company can convert its strategic buzzwords into hard numbers. The core of IBM’s business model today is a blend of hybrid cloud infrastructure, Red Hat centered open source software, consulting services aimed at digital and AI transformation, and a legacy hardware and mainframe segment that still throws off cash. The strategy is to use consulting as the tip of the spear, land AI and cloud projects with large enterprises, then scale those engagements into recurring software and platform revenue built on watsonx and Red Hat technologies.

Several factors will determine whether this strategy pays off for shareholders. First, enterprise IT budgets must remain resilient despite macro uncertainty. If chief information officers continue to prioritize automation and AI projects, IBM is well placed to win its share of that spend, particularly in regulated industries where trust, compliance and long standing relationships matter. Second, IBM has to demonstrate that watsonx is more than a marketing brand. Concrete case studies, measurable productivity gains for clients and growing AI related revenue disclosures will be critical to convincing investors that this is a sustainable growth engine rather than a passing theme.

Third, margin discipline will be under the microscope. Shifting the mix toward higher margin software and away from lower margin hardware and transactional services should gradually lift profitability, but only if IBM manages the transition without bloating costs. Finally, capital allocation will continue to attract scrutiny. The company’s generous dividend is a key part of the bull case, yet investors also want to see enough flexibility to fund targeted acquisitions and ongoing share repurchases without stretching the balance sheet.

In the near term, the most likely scenario is a continuation of the current consolidation phase, punctuated by sharper moves around earnings and major AI related announcements. If IBM can deliver a few quarters in a row of consistent growth in software and consulting tied explicitly to AI and hybrid cloud, the stock could reasonably grind higher toward the upper end of analyst target ranges and challenge its recent 52 week high. If, on the other hand, AI revenue fails to materialize at the anticipated pace, International Business Machines will probably slip back into the market’s mental bucket of reliable but uninspiring dividend names. For now, the balance of evidence supports a cautiously constructive stance, with the charts signaling patience and the fundamentals demanding proof.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405056_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 11:01:22.232522

Thanks to its advanced fuselage and engine technology, the A350 is today one of the most fuel-efficient aircraft in the skies, particularly when deployed on long-distance routes.

The Airbus A350 is the primary competitor of Boeing's popular 787 series of aircraft, and as of May 2025, a total of 658 have been built and delivered. In this article, we take an in-depth look at one of the A350's operational features - its service ceiling. The A350's service ceiling is around 43,000 ft, which is higher than many other commercial aircraft. Which factors contribute to the aircraft's high service ceiling?

What Is A Service Ceiling?

Firstly, let's establish what the service ceiling is when talking about aircraft. Put simply, the service ceiling is the maximum altitude at which an aircraft can fly and continue to operate normally and maintain a specific rate of climb. Once flying at or close to its service ceiling, an aircraft's ability to climb is significantly reduced due to the thinner air found at higher altitudes. The typical service ceilings of some of the most common commercial aircraft found in the skies today are outlined in the table below.

By contrast, an aircraft's absolute ceiling is the altitude that it can reach without being able to climb any further. There are many factors, often related to the aircraft's design, that can affect its service ceiling. Let's take a closer look at some of these.

Lighter Materials & Better Aerodynamics

Large parts of the Airbus A350's fuselage and wings are made up of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, which is much lighter than other traditionally used materials such as aluminum. This reduced weight allows the aircraft to perform better at higher altitudes.

The Airbus A350 also has a streamlined and aerodynamic design, which is the result of years of work from Airbus' design teams, and several redesigns throughout the early years of the aircraft's development. The aircraft's swept wings, winglets, and sleek fuselage all help it to reduce drag, and therefore improve performance at higher altitudes, including up to its service ceiling of 43,000 ft.

Improved Engine Technology & Fuel Efficiency

It is not just the aircraft itself that makes the Airbus A350's service ceiling so high. The aircraft is equipped with two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, which feature advanced technology, making them among the most efficient and powerful commercial aircraft engines currently available. The Trent XWB is designed to perform well at high altitudes where the air is thinner.

The Airbus A350's Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines help the aircraft to achieve a high level of fuel efficiency. Not only is this important in helping airlines to keep costs as low as possible and to meet ambitious sustainability targets, but it also allows the aircraft to operate more efficiently at higher altitudes, raising its service ceiling.

Greater Passenger Comfort

Like many other aircraft, including the Boeing 787, the Airbus A350 features an advanced cabin pressurization system, which maintains a cabin altitude of around 6,000 ft, compared to the average of 8,000 ft on older aircraft. This allows the A350 to operate at higher altitudes without negatively impacting passenger comfort. As a result, passengers can enjoy a cabin pressure and atmosphere more similar to the one that they experience on the ground, with reduced fatigue.

Given the extra-long length of many of the routes operated by the Airbus A350, passengers are sure to appreciate this feature. For example, the A350 will soon be used by Qantas to operate its Project Sunrise direct flights from Australia to both Europe and the US. It is also currently deployed by the likes of Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways on some of the world's longest commercial flight routes.

All About The Airbus A350

The idea of the Airbus A350 was first developed by the European manufacturer in 2004, in response to Boeing's upcoming 787 program. After several redesigns, the aircraft was eventually certified by both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Union Aviation Agency (EASA) in 2014, and went on to enter commercial service with Qatar Airways just a few months later in January 2015 on a flight from Doha Hamad International Airport (DOH) to Frankfurt Airport (FRA).

The Airbus A350-1000 also entered commercial service with Qatar Airways on a flight from Doha Hamad International Airport (DOH) and London Heathrow Airport (LHR). The A350 has proved to be a resounding commercial success for Airbus, and to date, more than 650 A350s have been built, across the two main passenger variants - the A350-900 and the larger A350-1000. Thanks to its modern appearance and extra passenger comforts, the A350 has proved to be popular with passengers too.

Data from ch-aviation shows that the world's largest operator of the Airbus A350 is Singapore Airlines, followed closely by Qatar Airways. Singapore Airlines has a total of 65 A350s, including seven A350-900ULRs (ULR = ultra-long-range), which the Star Alliance carrier deploys on its longest routes between Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) and US destinations such as New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

As of last year, Airbus still had a delivery backlog of more than 700 A350s awaiting production and delivery, with the aircraft's popularity showing no sign of slowing down.

Many Factors Contribute To The Airbus A350's High Service Ceiling

The Airbus A350 has a service ceiling of around 43,000 ft, meaning that it can comfortably continue to operate normally at such altitudes. That said, it is unusual for a commercial aircraft to fly at such a high altitude for any real length of time. There are a number of different factors that contribute to the A350's higher-than-average service ceiling.

As one of the most technologically advanced aircraft in the world, the Airbus A350 is able to fly at high altitudes. This is aided by its lightweight, composite fuselage, streamlined aerodynamics, and improved fuel efficiency.

The Airbus A350's industry-leading operational performance and full efficiency, which have contributed to it having a high service ceiling, have also secured the aircraft's commercial success. Thanks to its impressive credentials, the A350 is now a common sight in the skies around the world and is operated by more than 40 different commercial airlines around the world.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/deltaairlines.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-10 11:00:32.127329

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a multi-strategy investment firm that manages approximately $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.

What's happening

On Dec. 18, it was reported that Elliott has taken a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and is bringing in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company.

Behind the scenes

Lululemon is a global athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company, offering pants, shorts, tops, and jackets for activities such as yoga, running and training. While the company remains anchored in its core North America market (~70% of revenue), it has built a significant presence in APAC (~25%), and China specifically (18%), as well as Europe (~5%). In fact, these ancillary markets have grown quite rapidly, with APAC and Europe delivering average compound annual growth rates of 33% and 22% respectively, over the past year. This international expansion has helped drive strong overall topline growth, with sales growing from $8 billion in 2023 to $11.9 billion today. However, in that same period, the company's share price has gone down from over $500 to now below $220 per share. The problem here lies in North America. Growth in this core market has slowed to low single digits, and now has turned negative, with comparable sales down 5% in the most recent quarter. Further, while the China growth story resonated with investors when North America was showing continued expansion, this narrative on its own in the face of North American core uncertainty is not something that is very appetizing to public market investors.

The root challenges in the North America business can be traced back to 2018, when Calvin McDonald became Lululemon CEO. From the beginning of his tenure, and through the post-Covid period, the company operated in a golden era for athleisure, benefiting from the broad casualization of apparel and enjoying years of outsized growth as the only real large-scale player. While this environment delivered years of share price appreciation, it also masked a series of strategic missteps that would later come back to bite them. First, Lululemon used much of these earnings to pursue new business lines, including its $500 million acquisition of Mirror, as well as the launches of footwear and skincare lines, none of which have generated meaningful shareholder value. Moreover, while these initiatives may have been tolerable on their own during a period of rapid growth, they ultimately distracted management from the core North America business that was key to revenue growth. This loss of focus became especially pronounced in May 2024, when the company's chief product officer resigned. Since then, product direction and design have widely been perceived to be largely centralized under McDonald. Lululemon has shifted from its historically sleek and highly functional aesthetic toward louder branding and collaborations, such as with Disney, that are not aligned with the core customer. As a result, the company's brand perception has shifted, allowing competitors like Alo and Vuori to gain momentum and begin taking share, particular among Lululemon's core customer base of young women. This is a dynamic that is evident to anybody who shops in the category. While store traffic and brand awareness remain high, conversion has deteriorated. These product missteps have been further compounded by broader operational issues in the areas of marketing, supply chain and corporate cost controls. Together, these issues have driven margin pressure, eroded brand momentum in North America, and ultimately contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock price. On Dec. 11, 2025, Lululemon announced that McDonald would step down as CEO effective Jan. 31, 2026.

This impending leadership transition is what set the stage for Elliott to disclose a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and bring in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. Lululemon is still a quality product and brand that has somewhat lost its way and needs to be invigorated. It does not need a CEO who knows all the answers (if that exists) but one who will hire the best talent and institute the right processes so management can work as a team of marketers, merchandisers and product developers to come up with the solutions. At the same time by delegating these duties to competent senior executives, Nielsen will be able to also oversee the company's supply chain and corporate structure to solve the problems there and institute a cost discipline that has been absent. This is what Nielsen has experience doing at both Ralph Lauren and Coach. In 2014, when Nielsen was at Coach, the manufacturer of luxury handbags was losing out to rivals and announced that it expected same-store sales in North America to be down by a high-teens percentage in the coming year. Nielsen told investors that Coach would be back to profitability within two years. Nielsen helped Coach close underperforming stores and get inventory under control and by March 2016, the Coach brand posted its first quarterly sales increase in North America in nearly three years. When Nielsen joined Ralph Lauren in September 2016, sales had stalled and net income had fallen approximately 50% since 2014. In a 2024 article in The Wall Street Journal, Nielsen was quoted as saying, ""The brand was bigger and better than the business was showing"" — which is similar to Lululemon today. Nielsen and the leadership team targeted millennial and Gen Z shoppers and overhauled the website and closed stores, leading to an increase of 20% in adjusted operating income.

When an activist comes to a company with an idea or recommendation, they are just as happy if the company takes that recommendation or comes up with a better one. Elliott is not saying that Jane Nielsen is the best person for the job. The firm is saying that she is the best person it knows of for the job, and the firm does extensive and comprehensive diligence and analysis before making a recommendation like this. Elliott cannot name the next CEO. The board does that. And while Elliott would like to see Nielsen as the next CEO, if the board decides on someone else who is equally qualified, Elliott will support that decision. In practicality, whoever the next CEO is will be pseudo-approved by Elliott because we have never seen a qualified CEO with options take a job like this if they knew an activist like Elliott opposed his or her appointment. But Elliott's presence alone adds a lot of value to the situation which the board should recognize. First, it justifies a sense of urgency, which is needed here. Second, the firm brings to the table a more than qualified CEO candidate who is ready and willing to take on this role. Third, an activist of Elliott's stature and reputation can give the board cover in whatever decision they make. This third point is particularly important when there is an outspoken founder in the wings like Chip Wilson who has been publicly criticizing board decisions. Without the activist, even a competent and experienced board could compromise on the CEO selection to appease the vocal founder.

This is very similar to Elliott's recent campaign at Starbucks, another iconic brand facing popularity, competition and image challenges with an outspoken founder not afraid to give his opinion. At Starbucks, Elliott's efforts quickly culminated in the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, now working to reset the company's strategy and restore investor confidence. Elliott's presence justified the urgency required and its endorsement of Niccol gave the board the external credibility to act quickly.

Since Elliott engaged Lululemon, on Dec. 29, Chip Wilson has nominated three directors – Marc Maurer, the former co-CEO of On Holding AG; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer of ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision, the largest segment of Activision Blizzard – for election to the board at the 2026 annual meeting.

L'Oréal S.A. vs.
So, is L'Oréal S.A. actually worth the hype – for your shelf and your portfolio?","The internet is losing it over L'Oréal S.A. – from skin cycling TikToks to celeb collabs – but here’s the question you actually care about: is this beauty giant still a must-have for your money, or just legacy hype?

The Hype is Real: L'Oréal S.A. on TikTok and Beyond

L'Oréal isn’t just sitting on drugstore shelves anymore – it’s living on your For You Page.

DermTok loves the ingredients. MakeupTok loves the finishes. And your feed loves the aesthetics. This is one of those brands that quietly shows up in every “get ready with me,” “what I actually use,” and “my updated routine” video.

Why that matters: for beauty, clout is currency. If products keep going viral, shelves empty out, and that helps the business behind the scenes – aka the Loreal Aktie with ISIN FR0000120321.

Watch honest tests on YouTube

Social sentiment right now? Very much “this is what I actually buy with my own money” energy. You keep seeing the same hits: Infallible base products, Telescopic and Lash Paradise mascaras, skin-care from CeraVe-adjacent brands under the L'Oréal umbrella, plus premium names like Lancôme and YSL Beauty for splurges.

Is everything a game-changer? No. But L'Oréal keeps landing enough viral bangers that beauty creators keep it in rotation. That constant relevance is a big deal.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Here’s the breakdown – the three biggest reasons L'Oréal is still in the chat.

1. Viral pipeline: mass to luxury

L'Oréal isn’t one brand, it’s a whole beauty universe. You’ve got drugstore staples (L'Oréal Paris, Maybelline, NYX), derm brands, and luxury labels like Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent Beauty, and Valentino Beauty.

What that means for you: they literally touch every budget and every vibe. When a new trend hits – skin tint, blurring powder, lip oil, bond-repair haircare – at least one of their brands is ready to jump on it. That’s why you keep seeing new “I didn’t expect to love this” videos with their products.

2. Algorithm-friendly price point

L'Oréal’s hero products usually sit in that sweet spot: not cheap junk, not luxury pain. Think drugstore prices that still look luxe on camera.

Real talk: On social, products that are way too expensive get “dupe-hunted.” Products that are too cheap get side-eyed. L'Oréal lives in that “okay, I’ll actually buy this” zone. That’s why you see lines outside stores after a review blows up, not just comments saying, “looks nice, but I’m broke.”

3. Trend-chasing that mostly lands

Bond-building haircare? They have it. Glass-skin primers? They have that vibe. Transfer-proof lip color, skin tints, skin-barrier-friendly routines – L'Oréal’s brands are fast at copying, remixing, and sometimes improving what’s already viral.

Is everything a game-changer? No. But because they move quickly, they get first-mover clout in drugstores and big-box chains. For you, that means: you can actually walk into a store and buy the thing you just saw online without hunting niche sites.

L'Oréal S.A. vs. The Competition

So where does L'Oréal stand in the beauty clout war?

The main rival in the global beauty arena is Estée Lauder – think MAC, Estée Lauder, Clinique, La Mer, Too Faced, and more.

Social clout battle

L'Oréal: Huge presence in drugstores, supermarkets, and online. Strong on TikTok with products at reachable prices. Tons of mid-range and luxury brands that are creator favorites.

Estée Lauder: Big in prestige and department stores. Strong in skincare and high-end makeup, but less omnipresent in everyday “I grabbed this at Target” videos.

For Gen Z and younger millennials, L'Oréal wins because it’s everywhere you actually shop. You see it in Walmart, Target, Ulta, CVS, Walgreens, Sephora (for some lines), and all over Amazon and online retailers.

Innovation vs. aspiration

Estée Lauder leans hard into luxury and “treatment” messaging. L'Oréal leans into tech, labs, and affordability-crossing-into-premium. With AI skin analysis apps, shade matching, and science-forward branding on derm lines, L'Oréal feels closer to the “smart beauty” narrative that plays well on social right now.

Winner for clout? Based on reach, virality, and how often its brands pop up in “best of the drugstore” and “luxury vs affordable” videos, L'Oréal S.A. edges out Estée Lauder for the current hype cycle.

The Business Side: Loreal Aktie

Now the money question: what’s going on with the Loreal Aktie (ISIN FR0000120321) behind all this buzz?

Real talk on data: live stock quotes and exact prices change constantly and depend on your time zone and trading venue. At the time this was written, the markets were not actively trading, so only the latest available last close information can be used. You should always check a live source like Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or Reuters before making any moves.

Across major finance platforms, the picture is consistent: L'Oréal is treated as a premium, large-cap beauty stock with a long record, not a meme rocket. Think steady compounder energy, not lottery ticket.

How the price usually behaves

It tends to move with global consumer trends: when people are spending on beauty, it benefits.

It’s globally diversified: sales are spread across regions, which helps smooth out local slowdowns.

It’s not cheap: high-quality, global brands like this often trade at a premium to the overall market.

Is it a no-brainer at the current price?

That’s where it gets nuanced. L'Oréal looks strong as a business and brand, but the stock is often priced like everyone already knows that. If you’re expecting meme-level upside overnight, this is probably not your play.

If you care about potential long-term stability over pure hype, L'Oréal can make more sense. But again: no guessing. Always pull up a live chart, look at the latest close, and compare it with analyst commentary before you decide anything.

For reference, search ""OR.PA"" or ""LOR.PA"" on a site like Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg, confirm you’re looking at ISIN FR0000120321, and check the latest price, percentage change, and one-year chart.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, is L'Oréal S.A. actually worth the hype – for your shelf and your portfolio?

As a brand in your routine: this is mostly a cop.

You get products that show up again and again in viral reviews.

Prices that don’t totally wreck your budget.

A huge range across drugstore, mid, and luxury, so you can mix and match.

Not every launch is a game-changer, but there are enough hits that L'Oréal basically always has at least one product you’ll keep repurchasing.

As a stock (Loreal Aktie): this is more of a slow-burn maybe, not a hype-chasing must-cop.

If you like big, established brands with global reach, it checks that box.

If you want “to the moon” energy, this is likely too mature and too widely owned.

The price often bakes in a lot of optimism, so you need to be picky about entry points.

Real talk: for most people, L'Oréal makes more sense as the brand on your bathroom counter than as the core of some high-risk trading strategy. But if you’re into long-term, blue-chip-style beauty exposure, the Loreal Aktie with ISIN FR0000120321 is worth putting on your watchlist and checking whenever the market serves up a discount or a temporary price drop.

It positioned “personal fulfilment” as a central driver of future business growth. Instead of focusing on a single category, HP refreshed its entire portfolio at the show. This included business laptops, consumer PCs, printers, peripherals, and software, all aligned around AI acceleration, mobility, and human-centric design.

Availability and programs

HP plans to roll out its new OmniBook, OmniStudio, EliteBook, and Chromebook models throughout 2026. Most consumer models will begin shipping in early 2026, with enterprise systems following later in the year, depending on region and configuration.

HP also announced that its Future of Work Accelerator will return in 2026. The program will support organisations working on AI and workforce innovation applications open on January 12, with a February 6 deadline.

New devices focus on AI performance and portability

Kicking things off with the EliteBoard G1a, the world’s first full AI PC built into a keyboard. HP designed it for users who need portable computing power that moves easily between locations. The device won a CES 2026 Innovation Award.

HP also launched the EliteBook X G2 Series, its next-generation premium business laptops. These systems feature up to 85 TOPS of NPU performance when paired with Snapdragon X2 Elite processors. HP positions them as high-end AI work machines for professionals.

On the consumer side, the brand refreshed the entire OmniBook lineup. This includes the new OmniBook Ultra 14 and updated OmniBook 3, 5, 7, and X series models. Brand now offers OLED displays and AI-ready processors across the range. As per the claims, the OmniBook 3 16 delivers the longest battery life in a 16-inch OLED consumer laptop.

Alongside this, HP also introduced the new OmniStudio X all-in-one PCs. HP appears to be positioning this specifically for creators and home professionals. Basically, users who value screen size and colour accuracy as much as everyday multitasking power.

HP expanded AI beyond laptops and desktops.

The company integrated Microsoft Copilot directly into HP Office printers for the first time. This will allow users to summarise documents, translate content, and organise files directly at the printer.

HP also upgraded its Workforce Experience Platform (WXP). It added firmware-level recovery tools that allow IT teams to fix devices remotely, even when systems fail to boot. Brand says this helps reduce downtime in hybrid and distributed work environments.

Furthermore, there’s also HP Digital Passport, a new platform that gives users access to device information, sustainability data, setup tools, and support in one place. This product also received a CES Innovation Award.

HP unifies gaming under HyperX and launches a new flagship laptop

HP announced that it is unifying its OMEN and HyperX brands under a single master gaming brand called HyperX. As part of that shift, HP unveiled the HyperX OMEN MAX 16. They call it the world’s most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling. The company designed it for extreme performance, AI-driven tuning, and high-speed input.

HP says this move simplifies its gaming portfolio and creates a more consistent identity across gaming hardware, accessories, and software.

HP also refreshes peripherals and accessories

Last but not least, we also got to see some new peripherals designed for modern hybrid work. These include a compact 65W USB-C GaN charger, new ergonomic mice, protective laptop sleeves, and other workspace accessories. HP focused on portability, sustainability, and everyday usability.

HP’s strategy stands out for its breadth. It focuses less on a single flagship product. While Lenovo, ASUS, Dell, and Apple are also pushing AI and hybrid PCs, HP is trying to differentiate through ecosystem integration. That integration spans hardware, software, and services.

The EliteBoard G1a shows a willingness to rethink form factors. Meanwhile, Copilot at the printer and Digital Passport suggest that AI is becoming infrastructure, not just a feature. Whether this approach truly matters will depend on how much it improves everyday workflows.

HP’s announcements reflect a broader shift in the PC market. The company no longer treats business, consumer, creative, and gaming devices as strictly separate categories.

Whether this approach resonates will depend on how useful these AI features prove in everyday work. It will also depend on real-world performance, thermals, and battery life outside demo environments.",https://static.hub.91mobiles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/01/Hp-G1a-feat-1.png?tr=q-70,N,,2026-01-10 12:03:06.815663

Designed to work best with the iPhone 15 through iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max models, it is adaptable to other Android phones as well, so long as they fit snugly.

It’s getting easier to create content now, and should continue to be as we see more tech like this evolve.","CES is often a show that sees media capturing content all the time, especially when it comes to the tools of the trade unveiled there. The devices falling under this category vary widely, from drones to gimbals and on to unique cameras that can do things in ways others can’t.

Without further ado, here are some of the devices that stood out on the show floor.

Antigravity A1

This drone caused a stir at its booth during the show for the simple fact it has more than one way to fly it. Its main purpose is the ability to record 360-degree aerial footage in 8K, basically seeing everything all around it instead of only in one direction. That does make it a purely 360 camera, as there’s no way to switch to 180-degree shots but there are ways to reframe footage later when editing in post-production. Weighing roughly 249 grams, you don’t need to register it to fly in Canada, though rules still apply.

The A1 also enables a more immersive approach to piloting, pairing it with dedicated Vision goggles and a motion-based Grip controller that replaces traditional joysticks with gesture-driven control. This way, you can view a live 360-degree feed while flying, making it a fascinating first-person where you can see the drone’s view all around while it hovers in place. Combined with automated flight modes, safety systems like return-to-home, and streamlined editing tools for reframing and exporting footage, the A1 is aimed squarely at creators looking to push aerial video beyond conventional drone cinematography.

HoverAir AQUA

From the air to the sea, the HoverAir AQUA feels ambitious in what it’s attempting to do but I’m not aware of a drone that does it quite like this. While you can’t submerge this waterproof drone underwater and search for lost treasure, you can pilot it on the surface to capture watersports or point the camera down 90-degrees and see everything below—kind of like snorkeling. It can float, take off, and land directly on water, making it versatile enough for kayakers, paddleboarders, surfers, or anyone with an adventurous streak.

Weighing under 249 grams keeps it clear of most flight regulations, it can record 4K video up to 100 frames per second in wet and dry conditions. There are also 15 autonomous flight modes, including follow, orbit, snorkel, and mount options for hands-free filming. You control it through a Lighthouse accessory on your wrist, which functions as both a remote and a tracking beacon, enabling “follow-me” filming and simple one-tap commands for takeoff, landing, and mode switching without needing a phone.

Insta360 GO Ultra

While not entirely brand new, the GO Ultra action camera is easy to like when you first see it because it feels so adaptable. My personal favourite is the way it mounts through clothing via a lanyard and pendant you wear underneath, while a strong magnet attaches the camera to keep it in place. It comes with mount to do that, since the lanyard/pendant is a separate accessory but there are various ways to deploy this. Being a magnet, you can also pretty much attach it to any magnetic surface.

Add the optional Action Pod accessory and its 2.5-inch flip touchscreen, and you can remotely control it or get a live view of what it sees. It records in 4K at 60fps with a very wide 156-degree field of view, advanced stabilization, and AI-driven noise reduction. It also supports microSD cards up to 2TB. IPX8 waterproofing also enables it to capture footage underwater, making it a versatile little camera to take on any trip.

ShiftCam ProRig

ShiftCam’s ProRig can turn a smartphone into a more capable filmmaking rig by adding physical control and mounting options around the device. Designed to work best with the iPhone 15 through iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max models, it is adaptable to other Android phones as well, so long as they fit snugly. It includes multiple cold shoes, tripod mounts, and a slide-lock design that exposes USB-C ports, while also keeping the phone’s back open to attach MagSafe accessories.

There’s a detachable Bluetooth shutter remote that clips off on either side or works independently for some freedom in placement. ProRig supports ShiftCam’s own S-mount lenses and lets you integrate external microphones, lights, and other accessories to put together the best setup for you. For extra storage, you can also check out ShiftCam’s Planck SSD drives that are great for recording in Apple ProRes RAW.

Hohem MT3 and SSD-01

The Hohem iSteady MT3 Pro and SSD-01 mark two key devices in a broader creator-focused ecosystem. The MT3 Pro is a camera gimbal with top-end stabilization, while the SSD-01 provides high-speed storage for phones when recording video. The MT3 Series gimbals offer advanced AI tracking, smoother motion control, and support for heavier camera gear, with the Pro variant standing out more because of the detachable touchscreen remote. Clip it off and you have a live monitor and remote control all in one.

The ultra-compact SSD-01 delivers fast transfer speeds up to 2,000 MB/s read and 1,800 MB/s write, with capacities of 1TB and 2TB available. It supports Apple ProRes RAW and Open Gate recording from iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max, though works perfectly fine on iOS, Android, macOS and Windows. It even functions as a multi-port hub with mic receiver and fast-charging capabilities when you need both stabilization and storage.

XbotGo Falcon

The XbotGo Falcon is a hands-free AI sports camera that aims to give parents, coaches, and fans broadcast-style game footage without manual filming or subscriptions. Using computer vision and sport-specific AI models, it automatically pans, tilts, zooms, and tracks gameplay across more than 10 sports, with options to follow overall action or lock onto individual players by jersey number. Compact and tripod-mounted, it relies on a wide-angle lens with digital zoom, dual “AI Eyes,” and up to three hours of battery life, focusing entirely on video rather than still photos.

The idea is simple: set it up, hit record, and let the AI act as a virtual cameraman. You can store footage locally via microSD or in the cloud, and even livestream games on YouTube and Facebook. It can do all this with hockey, basketball, football, rugby—especially any sport with lateral play. Baseball is toughter, though XbotGo says it has a solution for that. Post-game, the AI tools can identify highlights and assist with editing, though full automation currently works best for basketball.

Wacom MovinkPad

Wacom’s MovinkPads are a new line of standalone creative tablets aimed at digital artists and creators who want a portable, all-in-one drawing experience without needing a computer. The most accessible is the MovinkPad 11, an Android-based tablet with an 11.45-inch display and Wacom’s Pro Pen 3, designed to let users sketch, paint, and work on ideas with very little setup. It includes sketching tools like Wacom Canvas and Clip Studio Paint DEBUT, and its textured glass surface and responsive pen aim to deliver a natural, paper-like feel that feels a little more real.

The MovinkPad Pro 14 expands the concept into a larger space with a 14-inch OLED display, rich colour coverage, and up to 120 Hz refresh rate. Features like Quick Drawing for instant capture and Instant Pen Display mode(in beta)—let the tablet function as a wireless or wired pen display for a PC or Mac.

Shure MV88

Shure’s MV88 USB-C Stereo Microphone is a compact, plug-and-play microphone you can pretty much use anywhere to capture high-quality sound straight from a phone, tablet, or laptop. The original MV88 had a Lightning connector, but this USB-C version natively supports Android, iOS, and other USB-C devices without adapters, letting you plug in and record right away without pairing or charging hassles. The microphone itself is a stereo condenser with four selectable polar patterns: adjustable stereo, mono cardioid, mono bi-directional, and raw mid-side.

I’ve used it on the show floor and it’s been great. I also like that it tilts to aim directly at sound sources and includes features like Auto Level Mode and Real-time Denoiser to help maintain clear, balanced audio in varied environments. Shures MOTIV app also lets you customize controls for microphone gain, five-band EQ, compression, limiter, and a high-pass filter to fine-tune what you want to hear.

Lexar Portable SSDs

Lexar’s latest portable SSDs include the Air Portable SSD and SL500 drives, which will come in limited edition versions co-branded with the Argentina National Football Team and display team colours, including the name and number of legend, Lionel Messi. These special editions bring the same portability and performance as the base models but with a collector’s twist for football fans and creators alike. They’ll come in capacities of 512GB, 2TB, and 4TB.

Ready to roll

Revvity (RVTY) just announced a collaboration with Eli Lilly that puts Lilly’s TuneLab AI and machine learning models inside the Revvity Signals platform, directly tying the stock story to AI-enabled drug discovery workflows.

The move builds on Revvity’s Signals Xynthetica and Models-as-a-Service offerings. It gives biotech customers a way to apply Lilly’s predictive models to their own data while keeping proprietary information protected through a federated learning setup.

Investors appear to be responding to the Lilly announcement, with a 1 day share price return of 2.67% and a 90 day share price return of 18.28% taking Revvity to US$104.43. However, the 1 year total shareholder return is still negative at 8.04%, and longer term total shareholder returns over three and five years also remain negative, so recent momentum is building from a weaker base.

If this AI push has your attention, it could be a good moment to widen your watchlist and see how other healthcare names stack up using .

With Revvity trading at US$104.43, an implied intrinsic discount of about 19% and a roughly 10% gap to analyst targets, is AI-driven optimism already captured in the price, or is the market underestimating future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 8.7% Undervalued

Compared with Revvity’s last close at US$104.43, the most followed narrative points to a slightly higher fair value, built on earnings and margin assumptions.

“Fair Value: risen slightly from approximately $113.67 to $114.38 per share, implying a modest increase in intrinsic value.

Discount Rate: increased marginally from about 8.41% to 8.43%, reflecting a slightly higher required return on equity.”

Want to see what is behind that valuation gap? The narrative leans on steady revenue expansion, wider margins and a future earnings multiple that is expected to compress over time. Curious which specific profit and growth paths are used to justify that outcome, and how buybacks are woven into the math?

Result: Fair Value of $114.38 (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh ongoing China reimbursement pressures and softer academic and government funding, which could challenge margins and the AI-driven growth story.

Another angle on valuation

The Simply Wall St DCF model already flags Revvity as trading about 18.5% below its fair value estimate, which points to an undervalued signal alongside the 8.7% discount implied by the popular narrative. When both story and spreadsheet line up like that, it raises a simple question: what might both be missing?

The company's stock faced selling pressure in the latest session, closing lower as the market digested a notable change in its investor registry.

A key development emerged from a mandatory voting rights disclosure filed yesterday. AXA Investment Managers UK Limited reported crossing a relevant notification threshold as of January 1st. The investment firm now holds a 3.88% stake in Vulcan Energy, equivalent to 18,561,143 voting shares out of a total of 477,870,976.

This represents an increase from a previously disclosed holding of 3.37%. The shift is not the result of new market purchases but stems from an internal corporate transaction. Following the acquisition of AXA Investment Managers by the BNP Paribas group, a consolidation of assets under the BNP Paribas umbrella necessitated a recalculation and fresh declaration of the voting rights. This integration provides greater transparency regarding the distribution of influence among Vulcan's major shareholders.

Market Performance and Valuation Metrics

The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) witnessed a negative reaction to the news. Vulcan Energy shares closed the trading day at AUD 4.635, marking a single-day decline of 3.44%. At this price level, the company commands a market capitalization of approximately AUD 2.215 billion.

Year-to-date, the equity has traded within a range of AUD 2.811 to AUD 6.292. The current price situates the stock near the midpoint of this 52-week band, suggesting a period of consolidation after earlier volatility.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Vulcan Energy?

Key Market Data Summary:

* Last Price: AUD 4.635

* Daily Change: -3.44%

* Total Voting Rights: 477,870,976

* AXA/BNP Paribas Holding: 18,561,143 shares (3.88%)

* Market Capitalization: ~AUD 2.215 billion

Progress on Major Project Financing

Parallel to the shareholder update, the company is making concrete strides in securing its financial foundation. Development finance institutions (DFIs) and export credit agencies (ECAs) are reportedly coordinating efforts to fund critical raw material projects across Europe. Within this framework, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is taking on an anchor role in a financing consortium that includes Vulcan Energy.

This builds upon steps confirmed back in December 2025, when Vulcan secured a conditional debt commitment of roughly USD 922 million (EUR 879 million) for its Lionheart project in Germany. The involvement of supranational institutions like the EIB forms a cornerstone of the company's capital strategy, designed to underwrite its planned carbon-neutral lithium production operations.

Trading Sentiment and Technical Perspective

Trading activity on the ASX indicated heightened investor interest. On popular forums such as HotCopper, the primary discussion thread for Vulcan Energy recorded a noticeable surge in views and comments. This spike in social engagement coincided with the ownership structure announcements, highlighting market attention on the implications of the BNP Paribas integration via the AXA takeover.

From a chart analysis standpoint, short-term focus shifts to a support level around AUD 4.60. The recent pullback raises questions about whether this zone will hold or if the share price will gravitate toward the lower end of its yearly range. The interplay between a clarified ownership structure and tangible progress in deploying the committed project financing is likely to be the decisive factor for future price direction.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2428120_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 07:59:01.157503

What Stripe’s move underscores is that the future of stablecoins is not about convincing people to care about blockchains.

“There are 30 million creators, and they’re in all these markets where the local currency isn’t really strong,” he said.","What that pitch can leave out, however, is everything that makes money usable at scale. That includes compliance, consumer protection, liquidity management, accounting standards and integration with existing payment rails.

But that gap is now closing, and some of the most telling developments this week came from the banking sector itself.

On Wednesday (Jan. 7), Digital Asset and Kinexys by J.P. Morgan announced a collaboration bringing Kinexys by J.P. Morgan’s products to Digital Asset’s Canton Network, a privacy-enabled blockchain network designed for synchronized financial markets. Also Wednesday, Barclays announced it purchased a stake in Ubyx, a U.S. stablecoin settlement company.

Capping it all off, PYMNTS and Citigroup announced the launch of a weekly podcast series aimed at giving corporate leaders practical guidance on stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. Called “From the Block: Straight Talk on Stablecoins and Digital Assets for Corporate Leaders,” the show will be co-hosted by PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster and Citi Global Head of Digital Assets, Treasury and Trade Solutions Ryan Rugg. The first episode will debut Tuesday (Jan. 13).

Stablecoins Move From Speculative Asset to Settlement Primitive

At the consumer and merchant level, the digital asset shift is even more striking because it is being framed as anything but cryptocurrency.

This week, Stripe expanded its crypto payment capabilities, enabling millions of merchants to accept blockchain-based payments with minimal friction. From a user experience perspective, little changes. Customers still click “pay.” Merchants still receive funds they can spend or convert. But under the hood, the rails are different.

What Stripe’s move underscores is that the future of stablecoins is not about convincing people to care about blockchains. It is about abstracting them away.

In the same vein, the stablecoin company Rain announced Friday (Jan. 9) that it raised $250 million in a Series C funding round to scale its infrastructure for stablecoin payments and add new capabilities and products.

Rain’s platform enables companies to launch compliant stablecoin cards that work everywhere Visa is accepted, offer rewards, convert fiat into stablecoins, power secure wallets and facilitate payouts.

Stablecoins may prove to be the most transformative chapter in digital payments because they merge money movement and reconciliation into a single digital packet, Rain CEO and co-founder Farooq Malik told PYMNTS in an interview posted in September.

It’s “the holy grail of money since the beginning of time,” Malik said.

Total stablecoin transaction volumes topped out at $33 trillion in 2025, Bloomberg reported Thursday (Jan. 8), citing data from Artemis Analytics.

What It Means for the Future of Money

Perhaps the most underappreciated stablecoin story this week came from creator platforms. Rumble announced Wednesday a partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether to enable audiences to tip creators natively in the Tether stablecoin (USDT), Tether Gold (XAUt) and Bitcoin (BTC).

Mark Nelsen, head of product for Visa Commercial Money Solutions, discussed this topic during a November interview with PYMNTS.

“There are 30 million creators, and they’re in all these markets where the local currency isn’t really strong,” he said. “That’s where stablecoins can offer a sweet spot in being able to say, ‘We can pay you immediately.’”

YouTube has also begun letting creators on its platform get paid in PayPal’s stablecoin.

Outside of the creator economy, U.S. states are also getting into the stablecoin issuance arena. On Wednesday, the state of Wyoming officially launched the Frontier Stable Token ($FRNT).

Earlier this year, PYMNTS interviewed two of the executives involved in the project, Rain’s Malik and Morgan Krupetsky, vice president of on-chain finance at Ava Labs.

“This is a different category of token that we haven’t seen before,” Malik said. “And it has a lot of really interesting opportunities for the state to embed itself into how money moves.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stablecoins.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 15:00:10.861700

Kramer is far from the first exec to tell young workers that if they excel in the small tasks today, the promotions will follow.
He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in—even those junior ones.","But Stephanie Kramer, the CHRO of L’Oréal U.S., says those small tasks are often where opportunity begins—and they played a surprisingly big role in her own career to the corner office at the world’s largest beauty company.

Quest fragrances, where she worked closely with perfumers early in her career

Before joining the Fortune 500 firm, L’Oreal, Kramer’s first job out of university was at Quest fragrances. It was also the first time the value of a simple coffee run stood out.

“I really wanted to have time to get to meet this incredibly cool perfumer,” she recalls to Fortune, adding that she went early to the meeting with the mindset that she simply wanted to support her team. But she soon discovered that “something positive comes out of those little things too.”

Instead of being wrapped up in being seen as the most junior person in the room, she quickly noted it gets you access.

“If you’re the one that is going to capture the actions from the meeting and the next steps, and you’re listening and you’re observing that isn’t that isn’t necessarily a negative,” Kramer explains. “You are in the room and you are absorbing how those points are coming to be. You’re developing the skills of inference.”

“So just make sure, when you’re discrediting some of those more small tasks, that you’re not discrediting their value they bring to you and your learning. I think about that all the time.”

Take whatever you can now, be strategic later

Kramer’s résumé spans Chanel, Kiehl’s, and L’Oréal’s corner offices—but it’s the middle-school roles and the odd, early-career errands she remembers most clearly.

“Those ones stick with you,” she says. That first job probably won’t be your dream role, it certainly wasn’t hers. But over time, it will have a snowball effect on your career.

“I don’t know if those are the ones where I ever wanted to be, you know, in my whole life.” Yet, she insists, every experience adds up. “It does. It makes a big difference.”

Her message to young workers facing a freezing job market: take the role, take the task, take the coffee run—because the value will only compound over time.

“You just have to start,” Kramer insists. “I guarantee that someday, that’s what you’re going to talk about in your interview.”

“It might not be the job that you have, or that you’re not necessarily sure that you should take. Right now, maybe it’s a paycheck, or maybe it’s a platform for you to connect with other people so that you can discover what you want to do.”

“When people ask me how I ended up in HR, I tell them it’s from middle school, because in middle school I was a lifeguard, I was a Girl Scout, I was a cross country runner, which means that you have to run through the woods alone, but you’re still making points as a team….Those jobs are part of what my job is today.”

The promotions will come later—but first, focus on

As the adage goes: If you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves. The same goes for your career. Kramer is far from the first exec to tell young workers that if they excel in the small tasks today, the promotions will follow.

Cisco’s U.K. chief spent 25 years climbing the ranks at the Fortune 500 Europe telecommunications giant BT, before joining Cisco in 2022 as managing director and being promoted lead its U.K. and Ireland arm just two years later.

She previously told Fortune that both Gen Z new hires and millennial middle managers need to be more “patient” in their quest for success. The promotions will come, but young aspirational workers should focus on building their skills over rushing to nab any new snazzy title to update their LinkedIn.

Pret A Manger’s CEO Pano Christou, went from working at McDonald’s for $3 an hour to earning millions as the boss of the British sandwich chain. He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in—even those junior ones.

“I’ve watched people that have been so fixated on the next role that they really take their eye off the current job they’re doing,” Christou told Fortune. “My philosophy has always been if you do a great job, people will notice you.”

Likewise, Shaid Shah, one of the most senior execs at Mars—the powerhouse behind household brands like Dolmio—said the best career hack is to stop obsessing over getting that promotion or dream job title, and embrace the many steps in between that get you there.

“It’s about acquiring the experiences that you need to realize your ambition, to realize what makes you happy, what makes you tick, what inspires you to get out of bed every day,” Shah explained. “Because career success is more than just hierarchy.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2025968628-e1764771331336.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-10 06:58:53.218262

Pest control is one of those unsexy, indispensable services that rarely makes headlines—until it fails. Termites quietly eat through a support beam, rodents compromise a food plant audit, or a bed bug outbreak forces a hotel to shut down floors. In that moment, the only thing that matters is reliability and speed. That is precisely the space Rollins Inc. has spent decades productizing and scaling into a global, tech-enabled platform.

Under consumer and commercial brands like Orkin, Critter Control, Western Pest Services, Acuren, and others, Rollins Inc. has turned a highly localized, technician-heavy business into something that increasingly behaves like a standardized product: predictable, recurring, defensible. Its core offering isn’t a gadget or an app, but a tightly engineered service stack—inspection, treatment, monitoring, compliance reporting—delivered through a unified operational model and supported by software, data, and training.

Get all details on Rollins Inc. here

Inside the Flagship: Rollins Inc.

When investors and operators talk about Rollins Inc., they’re increasingly talking about the productization of pest control. Rollins’ flagship ""product"" is an integrated service ecosystem built primarily around its Orkin brand in North America and an expanding portfolio of local brands internationally. The value lies in how standardized, data-aware, and scalable that ecosystem has become.

At its core, Rollins Inc. delivers four tightly defined solution sets:

1. Residential pest protection as a subscription product

For homeowners, Rollins Inc. has effectively turned pest control into a home subscription layer. Customers typically sign up for annual or multi-year service plans with scheduled visits and on-demand callbacks. This is not marketed as a one-off extermination, but as an ongoing protection product—a subtle shift that dramatically improves retention and recurring revenue.

Key features often include:

Regular, scheduled exterior and interior inspections

Targeted treatments for ants, roaches, spiders, rodents and other region-specific pests

Digital reminders, service histories, and technician notes accessible through online portals or mobile communications

Premium add-ons such as mosquito-focused seasonal treatments or termite-specific coverage

The result is a predictable, productized service tier that feels closer to an insurance policy than a one-off contractor visit.

2. Termite and structural protection as an engineered solution

Termites are a high-ticket, high-risk problem, and Rollins Inc. has leaned into that with clearly framed termite protection products. These typically include in-depth inspections, installation of baiting or barrier systems, and long-term warranties or damage repair guarantees depending on jurisdiction.

What distinguishes Rollins Inc. here is the repeatable methodology: standardized protocols, technician training programs, and sophisticated scheduling and routing tools that keep utilization high and margins healthy, even in a labor-intensive segment.

3. Commercial and food safety programs as compliance infrastructure

For food processors, restaurants, logistics hubs, and retailers, pests are a regulatory and brand risk. Rollins Inc. has tailored its commercial pest control products to align with audit standards for organizations like AIB International, BRCGS, SQF, and other global food safety schemes.

That means the product is not just pest elimination, but:

Auditable documentation and digital service reports

Trend analytics showing where issues recur across large sites

Integration with HACCP-style risk management and preventive control plans

National account coordination for large chains and multi-site operators

This transforms pest control into a compliance and risk-management layer within a customer’s broader operational stack—a far more defensible and sticky product positioning.

4. Wildlife, specialty and international services as brand-led micro-products

Rollins Inc. has systematically acquired and integrated regional specialists, including wildlife removal brands and international pest-control firms. Each acquisition is folded into a shared backbone of systems and processes, but the customer-facing brands retain local equity.

That approach turns Rollins Inc. into a portfolio of highly targeted micro-products—bat and squirrel exclusion in one region, bird management in another, or bed bug control solutions tailored for hospitality clients—while still benefiting from centralized technology, procurement, and data practices.

The technology layer

Behind these offerings, Rollins Inc. has been investing in the less glamorous, but immensely powerful underpinnings: field service management software, routing and dispatch optimization, CRM and account management tools, and increasingly, digital monitoring. In commercial environments especially, IoT-connected traps and monitoring devices feed into dashboards and reports that offer customers continuous visibility rather than just visit-based snapshots.

It’s not a Silicon Valley SaaS story, but the strategic use of software and telemetry is exactly what turns a fragmented, low-tech industry into a scalable platform business.

Market Rivals: Rollins Inc. Aktie vs. The Competition

In the global pest control market, Rollins Inc. competes most directly with a handful of major players and scores of local and regional providers. The most relevant benchmark products come from Rentokil Initial and Ecolab.

Rentokil Initial’s Pest Control Services

Compared directly to Rentokil Initial’s Pest Control services, Rollins Inc. is essentially battling another global giant with a similarly diversified portfolio. Rentokil offers its own suite of products, especially in Europe and Asia, such as:

Integrated pest management solutions for food processing and hospitality

Digital pest control tools like remote monitoring units and connected traps

Specialized termite and mosquito control offerings in specific markets

Rentokil has been especially aggressive in rolling out digital solutions and has broader legacy strength in Europe. By contrast, Rollins Inc. dominates the North American landscape and has been expanding internationally via acquisition. While Rentokil tends to emphasize its digital and analytics stack in marketing, Rollins leans on the strength of the Orkin brand and deep penetration into U.S. commercial and residential accounts.

Ecolab Pest Elimination

Compared directly to Ecolab Pest Elimination, Rollins Inc. faces a competitor that embeds pest control within a larger ecosystem of hygiene, sanitation, and water treatment products. Ecolab’s proposition to hotels, restaurants, and food manufacturers often bundles pest elimination with cleaning chemicals, dishwashing systems, and other facility solutions.

Where Ecolab excels is in integrated facility management and chemistry-driven solutions—its pest elimination product is one node in a broader operational web. Rollins Inc., however, focuses far more intensely on pest control as a core competency, with Orkin and other brands built around technician expertise, route density, and risk management. That single-mindedness shows up in brand recognition: in North America especially, the Orkin name is more directly associated with pest control than Ecolab’s more diversified portfolio.

Local and regional specialists

At the ground level, Rollins Inc. still competes daily with independent operators—local exterminators, family-owned regional firms, and specialty wildlife control vendors. These players often compete on price and personal relationships. Rollins Inc. counters with standardized quality, robust guarantees, faster emergency response via dense routing networks, and the credibility of long-running consumer brands.

In effect, Rollins Inc.’s product is engineered to sit between the massive, diversified global service conglomerates and the hyper-local independent technician—big enough to deliver national contracts and digital reporting, focused enough to feel like a dedicated pest specialist.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Rollins Inc. does not win by dazzling with futuristic hardware. It wins through a combination of scale, standardization, and relentless focus on a single problem: keeping pests from undermining homes, businesses, and brands.

Several factors give Rollins Inc. a durable edge over its competition:

1. Brand as a trust shortcut

In an emergency—rodent sighting in a restaurant, termite swarm in a living room—customers default to recognizable names. Orkin, Rollins’ flagship consumer brand, has spent decades turning its logo and trucks into shorthand for ""this will be handled."" That brand equity acts like a trust fast lane in both residential and commercial markets, which is especially powerful in a low-information, high-stress buying decision.

2. Productized service with recurring revenue baked in

Rollins Inc. has systematically reframed pest control as an ongoing protection product rather than a reactive service call. Multi-visit packages, annual plans, and long-term termite and rodent programs turn what used to be episodic revenue into subscription-like flows. That not only stabilizes the business, it also makes the customer experience more predictable and proactive—problems are addressed before they become crises.

3. Operational efficiency as technology, not just labor

The pest-control industry historically depended on individual technicians’ knowledge and manual scheduling. Rollins Inc. layers route optimization, CRM integration, and data-driven planning on top of that labor, increasing visit density and reducing downtime. For commercial accounts, digital reporting and analytics have become integral to passing audits and maintaining certifications, embedding Rollins’ products deeper into clients’ operations.

4. Acquisition-led expansion with a common operating model

By acquiring local and regional pest-control firms and plugging them into a standardized operating framework, Rollins Inc. can quickly extend its reach without diluting product quality. Each acquisition effectively becomes a new distribution channel for the company’s productized service stack, strengthening national accounts and building international presence.

5. Recession-resistant, climate-impacted demand

Pest pressure doesn’t follow economic cycles; in many regions, climate change, urbanization, and global trade are actually increasing the complexity and frequency of infestations. That creates a steady, and in some cases growing, baseline of demand. Rollins Inc.’s product is less a discretionary purchase and more a form of risk insurance—particularly for food, healthcare, and hospitality customers.

Put together, these advantages mean that when customers compare Rollins Inc. to alternatives like Rentokil’s Pest Control or Ecolab Pest Elimination, they’re often choosing between a diversified service conglomerate and a deeply specialized, high-trust operator. For pure-play pest solutions, Rollins Inc. consistently comes out ahead, especially in North America.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Rollins Inc. Aktie (ISIN US7757111049) has benefited materially from the company’s ability to turn a fragmented service category into a predictable, recurring-revenue engine.

Using external financial data from sources including Yahoo Finance and another major market data provider, as of the latest available trading data retrieved via live search, Rollins Inc. Aktie is trading at a level that reflects its status as a defensive, cash-generative growth story. Because this information depends on real-time markets, intraday prices vary; where real-time quotes are not available, investors should refer to the most recent ""Last Close"" price reported by their broker or a trusted financial platform. The figures examined in research were current as of the latest market session timestamped on the day of analysis.

What matters more than the exact print is the trajectory. Investors have largely rewarded Rollins Inc. for three intertwined characteristics of its product strategy:

High recurring revenue: Residential and commercial contracts create multi-year visibility into cash flows.

Margin resilience: Standardized processes and route density preserve margins even as labor and fuel costs fluctuate.

Acquisition runway: The company’s ability to integrate local firms without eroding its product quality gives it a credible long-term consolidation thesis.

Every additional contract Rollins Inc. signs—whether a national restaurant chain, a logistics network, or a growing base of residential subscribers—behaves like another node in a steadily compounding network of recurring revenue. That model has historically translated into a valuation premium versus many traditional service businesses.

From a market-structure perspective, Rollins Inc.’s product positioning also acts as a hedge for investors. The company operates in a space that is both defensive (people and businesses cannot simply defer pest control indefinitely) and structurally supported by environmental and regulatory trends. As climate shifts alter pest behavior and regulators tighten food and health standards, the value of a reliable, standardized pest-control product only increases.

In that sense, Rollins Inc. Aktie is not just a bet on a single brand like Orkin, but on the continuing productization of risk mitigation in the built environment. The more the company leans into digital monitoring, analytics, and integrated compliance reporting, the more its offerings begin to resemble a critical infrastructure layer rather than a commodity service.

For customers, that means faster response, more transparent reporting, and less guesswork. For Rollins Inc., it means that every technician visit and every connected monitoring device is part of a larger, highly defensible product ecosystem—one that is increasingly reflected in the way the market values its stock.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404990_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:58:43.233509

Fuel prices represent another channel through which the Venezuela crisis is influencing airlines.
The brokerage said and WTI crude oil prices declined about 21% in 2025, contributing to lower fuel costs for carriers.
Jefferies said oil price movements tied to developments in Venezuela are closely watched by airlines because fuel remains one of their largest operating costs.
Jefferies said the initial effects are “largely focused on airlines” due to cancellations and oil price movements.","Investing.com -- The political and military crisis unfolding in Venezuela is already affecting global airlines through flight disruptions, airspace restrictions and changes in fuel price dynamics, according to a recent note by analysts at Jefferies.

The U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which included the capture of President Nicolas Maduro during a large-scale raid in Caracas, led to immediate aviation impacts across the Caribbean region.

Following the operation, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed temporary flight restrictions, prompting widespread cancellations. Hundreds of flights in the Caribbean were canceled, including more than 300 flights originating from or arriving in Puerto Rico, the brokerage said.

Air Lines said it began canceling Caribbean flights early Saturday to comply with FAA airspace closures, while disclosed that trips to Aruba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico were canceled or diverted.

The disruptions affect a region that contributes a meaningful share of passenger revenue for major U.S. carriers.

Jefferies said Latin America accounts for 13% of ’ 2025 passenger revenue, 10% for and 8% for Delta.

The cancellations and diversions linked to the Venezuela operation underscore how geopolitical instability in the region can directly interrupt airline schedules and revenue flows.

Fuel prices represent another channel through which the Venezuela crisis is influencing airlines. The brokerage said and WTI crude oil prices declined about 21% in 2025, contributing to lower fuel costs for carriers. Brent crude was trading at about $60 per barrel at the time of the report.

Venezuela holds about 303BB barrels of crude, the largest proven oil reserves in the world, but produces only about 1MM barrels per day, or roughly 0.8% of global crude output, due to sanctions, economic conditions and limited investment in infrastructure.

Jefferies said oil price movements tied to developments in Venezuela are closely watched by airlines because fuel remains one of their largest operating costs. For 2026, the brokerage assumes an average oil price of about $62.40 per barrel, compared with about $70.20 in 2025 and $81.20 in 2024.

The analysts said each 5% change in estimated average fuel cost per gallon in 2026 would have a material effect on airline earnings, ranging from about 5% to 10% for Delta, Southwest and United, and about 20% for American Airlines.

Beyond fuel and airspace restrictions, the crisis has added operational uncertainty across Caribbean and Latin American air routes.

The FAA restrictions and airline responses illustrate how military activity can quickly alter flight paths and schedules, even outside the immediate conflict zone. Jefferies said the initial effects are “largely focused on airlines” due to cancellations and oil price movements.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPECBE0OL_L.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:02:53.204197

Lilly committed to paying an average annual wage of $102,503, exceeding 110 percent of the benchmark for its NAICS pharmaceutical manufacturing category.
Eli Lilly told the outlet this week that it does not have an update on the timeline.
The project is part of Eli Lilly’s broader push to onshore U.S. manufacturing.

The final Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation Act tax agreement that lured the pharmaceutical giant to Houston was posted to the state comptroller’s website this week, the Houston Business Journal reported. The deal caps a fast-moving courtship that began less than a year ago, when Eli Lilly first applied for the incentive program and publicly disclosed its interest in the region.

The global drugmaker plans to build the massive facility on 236 acres within McCord Development’s Generation Park, a 4,300-acre master-planned industrial park off Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport and the Port of Houston. The plant will manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients, including orforglipron, Lilly’s closely watched oral GLP-1 drug aimed at treating obesity.

The agreement offers a clearer look at the economics behind the splashy announcement.

Lilly committed to paying an average annual wage of $102,503, exceeding 110 percent of the benchmark for its NAICS pharmaceutical manufacturing category. The company said the plant will ultimately create more than 600 high-paying jobs, with an initial requirement of 75 jobs and $200 million in investment by the first year of the incentive period. The project will create 4,000 construction jobs for the duration of its buildout.

McCord Development will invest $100 million in infrastructure upgrades, while Lilly will handle the buildings, as previously reported by The Real Deal.

To secure the deal, Sheldon Independent School District agreed to exempt the property from school taxes through 2030, then cap the taxable value at 50 percent for another decade. The district’s board signed off in November, and Gov. Greg Abbott’s office added its signature on Jan. 5, finalizing the agreement after a joint announcement with Lilly last fall.

The timing of construction remains murky. While the incentive paperwork lists a Sept. 1, 2025 construction start date, no visible signs of work existed following Abbott’s Sept. 23 announcement. Eli Lilly told the outlet this week that it does not have an update on the timeline.

The project is part of Eli Lilly’s broader push to onshore U.S. manufacturing. CEO David Ricks has pointed to permanently lowered federal corporate tax rates as a tailwind for “intellectual property-driven” businesses, though he has downplayed the role of state incentives alone. Houston beat out a “very competitive” runner-up, he said, thanks to workforce quality, available space and a collaborative local government culture.

Those factors are baked into Generation Park’s pitch. The development is home to San Jacinto College’s Center for Biotechnology, creating a direct training pipeline for pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs, with Sheldon ISD already feeding students into the program.

While Houston lacks a deep biotech labor pool, the city has become home to an adjacent life sciences sector, with more than 700 life science companies making Houston home.

“In the age of AI, NVIDIA and Caterpillar are partnering across the full spectrum – from autonomous construction fleets to the AI data centres powering the next industrial revolution.”","Caterpillar and NVIDIA are expanding a collaboration to enhance manufacturing systems through physical AI.

The partnership focuses on deploying next-generation technology across construction, mining and power equipment used in factories around the world.

Joe Creed, CEO of Caterpillar, says: “As AI moves beyond data to reshape the physical world, it is unlocking new opportunities for innovation.

“Caterpillar is committed to solving our customers’ toughest challenges by leading with advanced technology in our machines and every aspect of business.”

Edge computing and autonomous machinery

Caterpillar says it is preparing its assets for an automated future by using the NVIDIA Jetson Thor platform to enable real-time processing. These hardware updates provide the foundation for autonomous operations and intelligent in-cab experiences.

The approach allows machines to process sensor data locally as a digital nervous system for worksites, reducing reliance on remote data centres. Machines equipped with these systems process billions of data points in milliseconds, Caterpillar says.

This capability supports equipment navigating variable jobsite conditions where latency can impact safety and productivity. By processing data at the edge, Caterpillar addresses connectivity in remote environments, helping autonomous fleets remain operational even in isolated mining or construction sites.

Generative AI for the industrial workforce

New in-cab features include an operator assistant that provides insights and safety alerts in real time.

The system offers coaching and productivity tips to help operators manage complex tasks with speed, directly addressing the growing skills gap in the industrial workforce.

At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, US, Caterpillar debuted the Cat AI Assistant. This proactive tool is embedded in digital products to help users take informed action using NVIDIA Riva speech models to provide lifelike voices and accurate recommendations on maintenance and parts.

Inside the cab, voice activation allows users to change settings and access troubleshooting guides. The tool relies on data stored on the Helios unified data platform.

Digital twins for resilient factory operations

Caterpillar is using an NVIDIA AI Factory to transform manufacturing and supply chain operations. This infrastructure helps create resilient production systems that are leaner and safer by automating processes such as forecasting and scheduling.

The company uses its manufacturing digital data platform to build physically accurate digital twins of its factories. These models use NVIDIA Omniverse libraries and OpenUSD to mirror real-world facilities with high precision.

They allow teams to design and optimise production layouts before building them in the real world, improving safety and efficiency during planning and expansion. By simulating factory workflows, Caterpillar can identify potential bottlenecks before they affect the physical supply chain.

Growth in industrial AI

The collaboration creates an ecosystem that touches jobsites, factories and supply chains globally. Caterpillar plans to launch an off-board version of the Cat AI Assistant in the first quarter of 2026 and increase research spending through 2030.

Jensen Huang, Founder and CEO of NVIDIA, says: “For a century, Caterpillar has built the industrial machines that shaped the world.

If Boston Scientific is on your radar for medical devices exposure, this could be a good moment to scan wider across healthcare stocks for other healthcare names showing similar interest and activity.

With Boston Scientific trading at US$97.64, a projected profit of US$0.78 per share, strong product demand and upbeat analyst targets, is there still a buying opportunity here or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 22.4% Undervalued

With Boston Scientific last closing at US$97.64 against a narrative fair value of about US$125.86, the story leans heavily on upbeat long term assumptions.

Over the longer term, bullish analysts see the company’s three year plan, centered on a broad slate of growth programs, as a credible roadmap for sustaining roughly 10% organic sales growth and above market EPS compounding.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what sits behind that confidence in steady double digit style growth and richer profit margins, and how it all feeds into a premium future P/E multiple and fair value north of US$120? The full narrative lays out the revenue runway, margin profile, and earnings power that need to line up for that outcome.

Result: Fair Value of $125.86 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, you also need to factor in risks, including tariff related cost pressure and intense competition, which could squeeze margins or challenge the premium P/E narrative.

Find out about the key risks to this Boston Scientific narrative.

Another View: Rich P/E Puts Pressure On The Story

That 22.4% narrative undervaluation sits against a very different message from plain P/E math. Boston Scientific trades on a P/E of 51.9x, compared with 31.3x for the US Medical Equipment industry and 41.4x for peers, and above a fair ratio of 41.3x.

In simple terms, the share price already assumes stronger execution than both the sector and similar companies. It is also above the level our fair ratio suggests the market could move toward over time. The question for you is whether the growth and margins outlined in the narrative truly justify paying that kind of premium.

At a share price of US$267.21, Lowe's has seen momentum build recently, with a 1 day share price return of 4.29% and a 90 day share price return of 15.07%. The 5 year total shareholder return of 70.99% points to meaningful long term value creation.

If this upgrade has you thinking beyond a single retailer, it could be a good moment to scan for other companies catching investor interest.

So with Lowe's trading close to Barclays’ new price target and recent returns already strong, is the upgrade flagging an undervalued home improvement heavyweight, or are markets already pricing in the next leg of growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 2% Undervalued

With Lowe's last closing at US$267.21 against a narrative fair value of about US$273.22, the valuation story hinges on how future earnings and margins evolve.

Ongoing pent up demand from delayed home improvement projects, combined with record high aging U.S. housing stock and an estimated 18 million new homes needed by 2033, points to a significant runway for future growth in renovation, repair, and new construction; this is expected to positively affect revenue and support sustained top line expansion as the housing cycle recovers.

Want to see what is baked into that price tag? The narrative leans heavily on modest revenue growth, firmer profit margins, and a richer earnings multiple. Curious how those moving parts add up to the fair value shown above?

Result: Fair Value of $273.22 (UNDERVALUED)

However, the story could change if acquisitions fail to integrate smoothly or if a flat home improvement market leaves those revenue and margin assumptions looking overly optimistic.

Behind the scenes, workers are dealing with the reality of aging systems, siloed data and rising customer expectations — a combination that makes consistency and speed harder to deliver with every new season and added stock-keeping unit (SKU).

New Multi-Agent Intelligent Warehouse (MAIW) and Retail Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprints are designed to turn this dynamic system into an advantage. These open-source developer references, launched today, empower developers to customize AI-powered solutions for the retail value chain, from warehouse to wardrobes.

“Building with these blueprints will reduce the cost of integration and help our customers and partners enable applications fast,” said Tarik Hammadou, director of developer relations for AI for retail and consumer packaged goods at NVIDIA. “They unlock the efficiency and enterprise‑grade scale the retail industry needs to compete.”

The blueprints will be showcased next week at the National Retail Federation: Retail’s Big Show.

Easing Warehouse Workflows

Warehouses are dynamic spaces with many moving parts, from boxes carrying a variety of retail goods to massive machines and workers fulfilling thousands of daily orders. Issues can arise in an instant — from out-of-stock items to cleanups needed in aisle four.

An ongoing issue within this workspace is a disconnect between the IT and operational technology (OT) layers. This gap bars managers from easily handling problems such as accurately measuring product inventory, efficiently pinpointing technology issues and deploying enough workers to areas that need extra help.

“The idea of having an agentic AI layer on the IT or OT level is not efficient, but having agents in between IT and OT allows the AI agents to act as the coordinators,” said Hammadou.

The NVIDIA MAIW blueprint delivers a synchronized AI system that sits above existing warehouse management systems, enterprise resource planning, robotics and IoT data, so teams gain real-time, explainable operational intelligence.

The blueprint comprises specialized agents for equipment asset operations, operations coordination, safety compliance, forecasting and document processing — all orchestrated by a central warehouse operational assistant that mirrors how warehouses actually run and turns fragmented data into proactive decision-making.

For example, a supervisor can ask in natural language, “Why is packing slow?” and the assistant analyzes equipment status, tasks queues and staffing data to highlight the bottleneck, shows the supporting evidence and recommends actions such as rebalancing work or adjusting task priorities.

The blueprint also provides production-grade capabilities — including role-based access control and guardrails to keep recommendations within policy — so operations teams can trust AI to help coordinate real equipment and safety-critical decisions.

By targeting metrics to detect and resolve issues and safety incidents, as well as ensure on-time order fulfillment and service level agreement adherence — MAIW helps warehouses move from constant fire drills to more predictable, data-driven shifts.

Partners such as Kinetic Vision, a product and technology development firm, can use the MAIW blueprint to innovate and tackle decades-long issues in retail supply chains.

“Chart and graphs are yesterday, we need predictions and prescribed actions,” said Jeremy Jarrett, CEO of Kinetic Vision. “The NVIDIA MAIW blueprint would allow you to have more of a central way to answer questions and prompt decision-making.”

Resolving Sparse Product Data

The Retail Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprint can help businesses of all sizes achieve richer and accurate product onboarding, as well as deliver localized marketing.

Retailers often face a “sparse data” problem: product images arrive with minimal or inconsistent text, and teams spend large amounts of time writing titles, descriptions and attributes, then customizing them for each market and campaign.

The blueprint addresses this by using generative AI to create high-quality, structured, localized and brand-aligned product content at scale.

For example, imagine a home goods retailer trying to update their online storefront with a basic set of ceramic mug photos. With an NVIDIA Nemotron vision language model (VLM), part of the Retail Catalog Enrichment Blueprint, the photos can be fed through the VLM to develop product metadata such as color, material, capacity, style and use cases.

From a single image, the system can then generate localized product titles and descriptions, extract and normalize attributes for search and recommendation systems for improved SEO and GEO, and create culturally relevant 2D lifestyle imagery and interactive 3D assets. Behind the scenes, an AI “judge” checks outputs for quality and consistency.

In addition, the Retail Catalog Enrichment Blueprint can create rich, on-brand marketing content by applying brand voice, tone and taxonomy instructions via prompts, alongside the product image and a target locale. The blueprint uses those brand guidelines to generate enriched product titles and descriptions, localized categories and tags, and culturally appropriate lifestyle image variations tailored to that intent.

Grid Dynamics’ NVIDIA Blueprint-Powered Solution

Companies are already creating their own products with the help of NVIDIA’s retail blueprints.

Global tech consulting firm Grid Dynamics has built a catalog enrichment and management system that increases the accuracy of item content and status of SKUs for large retailers, using the Retail Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprint.

“The quality of the search and the quality of the browsing experience for customers directly depends on the quality of the catalog data,” said Ilya Katsov, chief technology officer of Grid Dynamics. “It’s a very critical problem for all retailers with a digital presence to ensure their catalogs have as rich and consistent of attributes as possible — and our solution automates this so they don’t need to do manual reviews.”

For bigger retailers with massive product catalogs, attributes can be missing or incorrect. Onboarding new vendors with differing catalog structures can further jumble the data — leading to inaccurate sales, frustration and, eventually, a loss of customer loyalty.

This is where Grid Dynamics’ solution comes into play.

“Our solution makes product catalogs more discoverable while giving brands the ability to enforce their business rules at scale,” said Dan Guja, principal software engineer at Grid Dynamics. “With AI-driven business rules applied across the catalog, brands can improve data quality, sharpen customer intent signals and surface products customers actually want.”

Piecing Together the NVIDIA Retail Pipeline

The MAIW and Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprints are part of a greater initiative to reimagine the warehouse-to-consumer workflow with AI infrastructure at each level.

On the backend, the MAIW blueprint helps managers and warehouse workers in their daily supply and data management tasks, while the Catalog Enrichment NVIDIA Blueprint lets digital teams easily curate stylized SKU pages at the click of a button.

However, shortly after that report, Mr. Trump announced that he had called off the plan to ""surge"" federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Lurie.
""San Francisco is a city on the rise, crime is at historic lows, all economic indicators are on the right direction, and our local law enforcement is doing an incredible job.""
Going back to the pandemic, San Francisco has often been the strong focus of criticism from Republican lawmakers over its struggles in combatting crime and homelessness.
""I stay laser-focused on what I can control, and that's what's happening here in San Francisco,"" Lurie said.","San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie told CBS News Friday that he was able to convince President Trump in a phone call several months ago not to deploy federal agents to San Francisco.

In a live interview with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Tony Dokoupil, Lurie, a moderate Democrat, said that the president called him while he was sitting in a car.

""I took the call, and his first question to me was, 'How's it going there?'"" Lurie recounted.

In October, sources told CBS News that the president was planning to surge Border Patrol agents to San Francisco as part of the White House's ongoing immigration crackdown that has seen it deploy federal immigration officers to cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and most recently, Minneapolis.

At the time, the reports prompted pushback from California officials, including Lurie and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

However, shortly after that report, Mr. Trump announced that he had called off the plan to ""surge"" federal agents to San Francisco following a conversation with Lurie.

""I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,"" the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 23. The president also noted that ""friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge.""

""I told him what I would tell you,"" Lurie said Friday of his October call with Mr. Trump. ""San Francisco is a city on the rise, crime is at historic lows, all economic indicators are on the right direction, and our local law enforcement is doing an incredible job.""

Going back to the pandemic, San Francisco has often been the strong focus of criticism from Republican lawmakers over its struggles in combatting crime and homelessness. It was voter frustration over those issues that helped Lurie defeat incumbent London Breed in November 2024.

Lurie, however, acknowledged that the city still has ""a lot of work to do.""

""I'm clear-eyed about our challenges still,"" Lurie said. ""In the daytime, we have really ended our drug markets. At night, we still struggle on some of the those blocks that you see.""

An heir to the Levi Strauss & Co. fortune, Lurie also declined Friday to say whether he supports a proposed California ballot initiative that would institute a one-time 5% tax on the state's billionaires.

""I stay laser-focused on what I can control, and that's what's happening here in San Francisco,"" Lurie said. ""I don't get involved on what may or may not happen up in Sacramento, or frankly, for that matter, D.C.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/10/758109d6-f8b8-43cf-8d5e-508ca65a218e/thumbnail/1200x630/e67521dbce98acba06f2baff4e67a73e/1768006429674.png,N,,2026-01-09 21:00:46.472498

“The strong demand for our hybrid notes and the outcome we achieved reflect deep investor confidence in Aldar’s credit strength and disciplined countercyclical financial strategy.
The hybrid enhances our capital structure with long-term, flexible funding while supporting our investment-grade profile and preserving senior debt capacity for further growth.
Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa3 to the hybrid notes, sitting one notch below Aldar’s corporate rating of Baa2.
The structure of the new hybrid is identical to Aldar’s successful $1 billion hybrid issuance completed in January 2025.","Aldar announced on Friday that it successfully priced its $1 billion subordinated dated hybrid notes. The transaction attracted robust demand from a global institutional investor base, underscoring confidence in Aldar’s credit profile and earnings outlook as it continues to deliver on its transformational growth strategy.

“The strong demand for our hybrid notes and the outcome we achieved reflect deep investor confidence in Aldar’s credit strength and disciplined countercyclical financial strategy. The hybrid enhances our capital structure with long-term, flexible funding while supporting our investment-grade profile and preserving senior debt capacity for further growth. It positions us to continue executing our growth priorities and pipeline with confidence, building on the strong momentum across the business and the real estate market,” said Faisal Falaknaz, group chief financial and sustainability officer at Aldar.

Issuance achieves peak orderbook reaching $4.2 billion

Proceeds from the issuance seek to support the continuation of Aldar’s growth agenda and its strategic priorities, including landbank replenishment, expansion of its develop-to-hold portfolio, strategic acquisitions, optimizing the debt profile to enhance the overall credit profile and preserving debt capacity to fund and support future strategic growth initiatives.

Reflecting strong global confidence in Aldar’s financial strength and its proven track record, the issuance was oversubscribed, with the peak orderbook reaching $4.2 billion and strong participation from institutional investors across diverse geographies.

The final allocation comprises investors from the Middle East (31 percent), United Kingdom (27 percent), North America (24 percent), Asia (10 percent) and Europe (8 percent).

The unsecured, subordinated 30.25-year notes are non-callable for 7.25 years and will bear an initial yield of 5.95 percent and a coupon rate of 5.875 percent. The notes have characteristics of both debt and equity. The coupon payments will be distributed semi-annually and may be deferred. The offering is expected to close on 14th January 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.

Aldar raises $5.1 billion in funding in 2025

As a debt instrument, the issuance is non-dilutive for Aldar equity investors. It is treated as 50 percent equity and 50 percent debt by Moody’s, enhancing Aldar’s overall credit profile while preserving senior debt capacity for future growth initiatives.

Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa3 to the hybrid notes, sitting one notch below Aldar’s corporate rating of Baa2. This rating reflects Aldar’s robust financial position, strong liquidity and its standing as a strategic partner to the Abu Dhabi government.

Marketed under 144A / Reg S, the issuance was globally led and coordinated by Citi, alongside Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Emirates NBD Capital, First Abu Dhabi Bank, IMI-Intesa Sanpaolo, J.P. Morgan, Mashreq, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, and The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah, acting as joint lead managers and bookrunners.

The structure of the new hybrid is identical to Aldar’s successful $1 billion hybrid issuance completed in January 2025. The $1 billion raised in the latest transaction adds to a total of $5.1 billion in funding raised by the group throughout 2025, including $1.5 billion of hybrid capital, further strengthening the company’s liquidity and capital structure.",https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Aldar.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 21:00:55.436492

Each month, eager collectors line up for hours outside Delta's surplus sale in Hapeville, hoping to be among the first allowed inside to buy vintage Delta Airlines items.

""I'm from Atlanta, so I always liked Delta,"" said customer Holden Thomas. ""I grew up flying Delta jets, and this is really exciting to see.""

Once inside, shoppers are greeted by a room packed with airline memorabilia. Items range from vintage Delta signage and airport terminal chairs to replica airplanes. Some lucky visitors stumble upon unexpected treasures—like a Peloton bike from Delta's employee gym or even customized blades from a Delta airplane engine.

""For the three years I've been coming here, they've had blades, but they've never had them customized like this,"" said collector Jack McCormack.

Among the most sought-after items are the iconic galley carts, though none were available at January's sale. Still, that didn't dampen enthusiasm. Shoppers crowded around other collectibles, including limited-edition 100th anniversary golf balls and clubs.

""Golf balls, yes—100-year anniversary golf balls,"" said customer Luis Rivera. ""I like seeing a part of Delta history. My whole family pretty much works for Delta.""

Beyond the nostalgia and collectibles, the sale serves a greater purpose. Proceeds raised more than $275,000 last year, all benefiting the Delta Flight Museum.

At midday this Friday, the CAC 40 is up by 0.75%, reaching 8,305.34 points, driven by an unusual alliance between luxury and finance. The Parisian index shows favorable dispersion with 24 stocks rising against 16 declining, indicating a relatively broad movement but concentrated on a few key leaders. The atmosphere remains marked by low trading volumes, characteristic of the start of the year when many investors are staying on the sidelines. The absence of a major catalyst on the corporate earnings front leaves the market reacting more to technical movements and position adjustments following the first sessions of 2026.

L'Oréal, the cosmetics giant, stands out as the main driver of the increase with a jump of 4.53% to 379.35 euros, accompanied by BNP Paribas, which gains 3.56% to 85.44 euros. This performance by the bank comes as the European financial sector sees renewed interest, without any particular news on the French front. In the luxury sector, Hermès rises by 2.85% to 2,198 euros, while Kering follows with an increase of 2.74% to 318.3 euros, illustrating a temporary renewed appetite for this key sector in the Paris market. STMicroelectronics rounds out the top three gains with a rise of 2.54% to 24.62 euros, benefiting from a positive movement in European semiconductors after several challenging weeks.

Cyclical and Financial Stocks Under Pressure

Defying the trend, Euronext posted the largest drop in the CAC 40, falling 4.08% to 120 euros, as the stock exchange operator suffers from an overall unfavorable climate for trading volumes at the start of the year. Bouygues fell 2.51% to 45.14 euros, reflecting caution surrounding construction and telecommunications stocks. The banking sector showed mixed results: while BNP Paribas soared, Société Générale declined by 2.13% to 68.88 euros, highlighting some shifts within the financial sector. Vinci dropped 1.94% to 121.35 euros following Bouygues, as both French construction giants navigate a wait-and-see environment for major infrastructure projects. AXA rounded out the top declines with a 1.56% drop to 39.81 euros, as the insurer faced profit-taking after several sessions of gains. This bipolar configuration of the Parisian market indicates a session of repositioning rather than a movement of conviction, with investors favoring quality stocks and sector leaders while reducing positions in cyclicals and certain financials.

A European and International Context Defined by Caution

Other European markets are experiencing a similar environment this Friday midday, with moderate gains and limited trading volumes. This widespread sluggishness marks the start of 2026, as investors await clearer signals on the economic situation and the direction of monetary policies. In Paris, Friday's session exemplifies this phase of observation: the CAC 40 is indeed rising, but more due to a few standout performers rather than any underlying momentum. Low volumes confirm that major fund managers remain cautious, opting for prudence before making significant moves at the beginning of the year.

Johnson & Johnson Commits $2 Billion to North Carolina Manufacturing Expansion.","Johnson & Johnson has reached a voluntary agreement with the Trump Administration to join TrumpRx, a direct-to-patient platform with a goal to lower US drug prices and align them with that of their European counterparts.1

In exchange for joining the program, J&J will be exempt from tariffs.

“Today’s agreement shows that when the public and private sectors work together towards shared goals, we can deliver real results for patients and the US economy,” noted Joaquin Duato, J&J’s chairman and CEO.1 “I’m proud that Johnson & Johnson is answering President Trump’s call to lower drug prices for everyday Americans while maintaining our role in improving and saving lives and ensuring that the United States continues to lead the world in healthcare innovation.”

TrumpRx expands big pharma participation

Since President Trump’s reveal of TrumpRx in late September,2 15 companies have agreed to join the government-run website. Besides J&J, the most recent additions came last month, when the president held a briefing3 in which he revealed nine additional Big Pharma participants, including:

Amgen

Boehringer Ingelheim

Bristol-Myers Squibb

Genentech

Gilead

GSK

Merck

Novartis

Sanofi

During the press event, Trump also mentioned that he had reached new agreements with various European leaders to confirm that drug prices in those respective nations were consistent with those in the US, using the threat of levies to help negotiate.

What the TrumpRx agreement means for drug pricing and patient access

As for J&J, the company will be working with the current administration to prioritize drug affordability and patient access, signifying that by participating in TrumpRx, patients in the US will be able to purchase J&J meds at “significantly discounted” prices.1 Access to Medicaid will also come at a similar price compared with other countries.

Johnson & Johnson reinforces US manufacturing and investment strategy

Meanwhile, the company continues to stand by its $55 billion pledge to support domestic manufacturing, research and development, and tech investments by 2029. This past August, the company announced $2 billion plans to boost its North Carolina presence by constructing a 160,0000-plus-square-foot manufacturing facility at FUJIFILM’s new biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs, NC.4

“Johnson & Johnson has more manufacturing facilities in the US than in any other country, and we continue to strengthen our presence here,” said Duato at the time of the announcement.4 “With the recent signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, we continue to expand our investment in the US to lead the next era of healthcare innovation.”

Policy shifts, OBBA, and the broader pharma market impact

Also known as the OBBA, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reshapes prescription drug spending, while pushing pharma companies to mitigate its potential impact on innovation, R&D investment, and M&A activity.

“Starting out with the One Big Beautiful Bill, I kind of look at a couple things that are happening at the same time,” explained Philip Sclafani, PwC's pharmaceutical and life sciences lead, in a video interview5 with Pharma Commerce.

… “We think about those patients unfortunately not being able to get all the prescriptions they would want, spending and pharma company revenues going down there. On the other side, we do see significant innovation coming in from newer therapies—obviously GLP-1s continuing to grow, and others—so I think it's important to look at the totality.”

Also in the works for J&J are two additional US production plants, featuring a cell therapy manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, along with a product manufacturing facility in North Carolina.1

The completion of the deal, which occurred on Thursday, removes the regulatory overhang that had persisted since the initial announcement.

A Dual-Pronged Growth Strategy Emerges

Market analysts are framing IBM's recent actions as a two-track approach to growth. The immediate focus is on the integration of Confluent, whose technology is built on the industry-standard Apache Kafka data-streaming platform. The core rationale is clear: modern enterprises require live data pipelines to supply AI models with up-to-the-minute information, and Confluent provides the necessary infrastructure. IBM's CEO, Arvind Krishna, anticipates rapid alignment of the two companies' sales networks, with IBM's global consulting arm poised to embed Confluent's solutions directly into existing client engagements. Expected revenue synergies from this combination are a key point of interest for shareholders.

Concurrently, IBM is advancing its long-term ambitions in quantum computing. The company recently unveiled its new ""Nighthawk"" quantum processor, which features 120 qubits. This processor utilizes a novel manufacturing technology based on 300-millimeter wafers, representing a significant technological leap toward the goal of fault-tolerant quantum computers, a milestone targeted for 2029.

Institutional Confidence and Upcoming Financials

Alongside these corporate developments, regulatory filings indicate growing institutional interest. For instance, the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund recently increased its stake in IBM, a signal often interpreted as confidence in the company's medium-term transformation trajectory.

Investor attention now shifts to the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for the end of January. Market participants will be looking for early insights into the Confluent integration process and the combined revenue outlook for 2026. A central question will be the speed at which Confluent's sales team can be effectively incorporated into IBM's broader organization. From a technical perspective, IBM's share price is trading near its 52-week high. A successful execution of the integration strategy could potentially propel the equity beyond the $325 resistance level. This outlook was echoed by analysts at Jefferies, who upgraded IBM to a ""Buy"" rating this week, citing the potent combination of an accelerated software business through Confluent and continued hardware innovation in quantum computing.

Key Takeaways:

BNY launched tokenized deposits to allow on-chain transfers while keeping funds within the regulated banking system.

The service supports faster, 24/7 settlement and programmable transactions for collateral and margin use cases.

The move reflects growing institutional adoption of tokenization by major global banks.

In an announcement published Friday, BNY said it has facilitated an on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its Digital Assets platform.

The initiative marks the first phase of the bank’s strategy to tokenize deposits, starting with collateral and margin workflow use cases.

BNY Says Tokenized Deposits Mirror Bank Balances On-chain

The tokenized deposits operate as digital book entries that reflect clients’ existing demand deposit claims against the bank.

While balances are mirrored on-chain, they continue to be recorded on BNY’s traditional systems, ensuring regulatory, accounting, and reporting consistency.

The capability runs on BNY’s private, permissioned blockchain and is governed by the bank’s existing risk and compliance frameworks.

BNY said the launch is designed to support programmable, near-real-time cash movement as financial markets shift toward always-on operating models.

Tokenized deposits could help reduce settlement friction, improve liquidity efficiency, and allow rules-based payments across institutional workflows.

Early participants include Intercontinental Exchange, Citadel Securities, DRW Holdings, Baillie Gifford, Circle, Ripple Prime, and several other financial and digital asset firms.

ICE said it plans to support tokenized deposits across its clearinghouses as it prepares for 24/7 trading and settlement.

In September, BNY announced it is making strides towards offering custody services for Bitcoin and Ether, specifically for its exchange-traded product (ETP) clients.

Earlier this year, the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant reportedly reviewed BNY Mellon’s approach to crypto custody.

The SEC didn’t object to BNY Mellon’s decision not to include these crypto assets as liabilities on its balance sheet.

The review was key because of the SEC’s SAB 121 rule, which requires banks to account for crypto assets they safeguard as both a liability and an asset on their balance sheets.

BNY Mellon’s unique case with ETPs, however, which bypasses this requirement.

About two dozen drivers and supporters spoke or held up signs calling for safer streets and greater accountability outside the offices of the California Public Utilities Commission, which met Friday to consider further regulations on autonomous vehicles.

A steady stream of Waymo cars drove past the protest, a testament to the growing ubiquity of the white cars in San Francisco.

“I personally am not against technology; what I am against is unfair treatment,” said Joseph Augusto, who drives for both Uber and Lyft. “We have these people, these companies, these autonomous vehicle companies who are driving around the city, and they don’t seem to be held to the same standards as we drivers.”

The California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates Uber and Lyft, is refining and expanding policies around autonomous robotaxis as the industry grows. The California Gig Workers Union says the vehicles should be removed from streets until safety concerns are addressed.

The state agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

Hobbled Waymos blocked San Francisco streets during a mass power outage days before Christmas, forcing the company to pause service and raising questions about the cars’ ability to adapt to real-world driving conditions.

In September, a Waymo pulled an illegal U-turn in front of a sign telling drivers not to do that, but San Bruno police could not issue a ticket because there was no human driver. In October, a Waymo crushed a popular neighborhood cat named Kit Kat.

Augusto, the driver, said he saw Waymos stalled at intersections as people darted around them on Dec. 20 when the lights went out across San Francisco.

“There were a lot of Waymos around. Just randomly all over the city and there’s no plan,” he said.",https://www.wcbi.com/content/uploads/2026/01/f/h/mgn-1280x960-20324b00-qvmah.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 17:14:58.669309

This recent mass scanning campaign systematically targeted more than 73-plus LLM model endpoints, including OpenAI-compatible API and Google Gemini formats, GreyNoise said in a blog post Thursday.
These IP addresses were observed in past GreyNoise data conducting CVE exploitation campaigns for more than 200 different vulnerabilities, including React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) and the TP-Link router flaw CVE-2023-1389.
GreyNoise said the data indicates the attacker targeting LLM endpoints is a “professional threat actor conducting reconnaissance” who is “building target lists” for future exploitation of exposed AI APIs.

More than 91,000 attack sessions were recorded by GreyNoise’s Ollama honeypot infrastructure between October 2025 and January 2026; 80,469 of these sessions took place over the 11-day period between Dec. 28, 2025, and Jan. 8, 2026.

This recent mass scanning campaign systematically targeted more than 73-plus LLM model endpoints, including OpenAI-compatible API and Google Gemini formats, GreyNoise said in a blog post Thursday.

Models targeted included OpenAI’s GPT family, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, Google’s Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Alibaba’s Qwen and xAI’s Grok.

Related reading:

The activity indicates that threat actors were probing for misconfigured servers leaking access to commercial AI APIs. The attackers tested the endpoints with text queries to see which models would respond, with the most common query being “hi,” at 32,716 occurrences, and the second most common being “How many states are there in the United States?” at 27,778 occurrences.

Just two IP addresses were behind all 80,469 sessions — one U.S.-based IP address generated 49,955 sessions and another Netherlands-based address generated 30,514 sessions.

These IP addresses were observed in past GreyNoise data conducting CVE exploitation campaigns for more than 200 different vulnerabilities, including React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) and the TP-Link router flaw CVE-2023-1389.

The two addresses racked up a total history of more than 4 million GreyNoise sensor hits combined.

GreyNoise said the data indicates the attacker targeting LLM endpoints is a “professional threat actor conducting reconnaissance” who is “building target lists” for future exploitation of exposed AI APIs.

“If you’re running exposed LLM endpoints, you’re likely already on someone’s list,” Bob Rudis, vice president of data science at GreyNoise, wrote in the blog post.

In addition to blocking the offending IP addresses, GreyNoise recommended rate-limiting suspicious autonomous system numbers (ASNs) such as those used in the campaign, monitoring for rapid requests to multiple LLM endpoints and watching for specific queries that appeared frequently in the scanning campaign, such as “How many states are there in the United States?” and “How many letter r are in the word strawberry?”

Separate campaign spiked over Christmas

GreyNoise’s blog post also highlighted a separate campaign that ran from October 2025 and January 2026, which spiked over Christmas, generating 1,688 sessions over a 48-hour period.

This campaign abused Ollama’s model pull functionality to exploit server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities by injecting malicious registry URLs. The attackers were observed using ProjectDiscovery’s Out-of-band Application Security Testing (OAST) infrastructure to confirm exploitation success.

GreyNoise noted that this campaign coincided with another targeting Twilio SMS webhook integrations, which manipulated MediaUrl parameters to achieve outbound connections to the attacker’s server.

The vast majority of attacks (99%) shared the same JA4H signature despite being spread across 62 different IP addresses spanning 27 countries. This pattern points to the attackers potentially using a virtual private server (VPS) along with a shared automation tool such as ProjectDiscovery’s Nuclei to conduct their activity, Greynoise noted.

The researchers ultimately assessed that this campaign likely originated from security researchers or bug bounty hunters but potentially crossed over into grey-hat activity due to the unusually high volume of attacks over the Christmas holiday.

To defend against such SSRF campaigns targeting Ollama deployments, GreyNoise recommends configuring Ollama so that only models from trusted registries can be pulled, blocking OAST at the domain name system (DNS) layer and monitor for JA4 fingerprints indicating automated tooling such as that used in the observed campaign.",https://files.cyberriskalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_1372668605_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:58:37.082190

Snake River is always exploring new product ideas and ways to introduce incredible regional cuts to audiences who may have never experienced them before, Kelso said.
Brisket, she said, will always be BBQ royalty — but there are so many exceptional cuts that deserve their moment in the spotlight.
“If we limit BBQ to just brisket and ribs, we miss out on a world of truly delicious possibilities.
Cooks are experimenting more, “playing with their food,” and pushing beyond traditional low-and-slow smoking into hot-and-fast, direct-flame and other techniques.","Over the past decade, Snake River Farms has seen a steady and significant rise in consumer demand for traditional BBQ cuts — most notably beef brisket, but also ribs, shoulder, and most recently pork collars, said Annella Kelso, the company’s head of e-mail and BBQ marketing. But increasingly, Americans are also open to experimenting with new cuts.

The overall growth, she said, has been fueled in large part by the explosive popularity of competitive BBQ and the rise of BBQ-focused television, streaming, and digital content.

“As more people are exposed to the craft through these platforms, they’re becoming not just fans of BBQ, but students of it. Today’s consumers want to understand the process, hone their skills, and recreate authentic, competition-quality results at home. That passion for mastering the art of smoke continues to drive sustained demand across the entire category.”

Social media allows people to learn how to BBQ in real time — how to select the right cut, how to season it, how to manage a fire, and how to achieve great results at home.

Snake River is always exploring new product ideas and ways to introduce incredible regional cuts to audiences who may have never experienced them before, Kelso said. Brisket, she said, will always be BBQ royalty — but there are so many exceptional cuts that deserve their moment in the spotlight.

Cuts like picanha, bavette (sirloin flap) and outside skirt steak are gaining traction as pitmasters and home cooks experiment with different techniques and flavors.

“If we limit BBQ to just brisket and ribs, we miss out on a world of truly delicious possibilities. What’s exciting right now — and moving into the future — is how open consumers are to discovery, experimentation, and elevating everyday cooking through fire.”

Live-fire cooking is another huge trend that Snake River is tracking right now, and it’s changing the way people approach BBQ. Cooks are experimenting more, “playing with their food,” and pushing beyond traditional low-and-slow smoking into hot-and-fast, direct-flame and other techniques.

That openness, Kelso said, has created space for people to explore unique cuts they might not normally smoke — “and we’re absolutely here for that kind of creativity.”

Tallow is also having a major moment, she added. More people are frying in it, wrapping with it, and using it as a flavor-builder across all kinds of cooking — not just BBQ.

Une dégradation du marché de l'emploi serait interprétée comme un signe du ralentissement de l'activité, ce qui offrirait davantage de marges de manœuvre à la Fed pour baisser ses taux, un scénario positif pour les marchés d'actions.

ID7,Best Buy,2026-01-09 20:02:16+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Trump Orders Fannie and Freddie to Buy $200 Billion in Mortgage Bonds,"Matthew Goldstein, Joe Rennison, www.nytimes.com, matthew-goldstein, joe-rennison",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/business/trump-fannie-freddie-mortgage-bonds.html,"In a post on social media on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds.
While his announcement was short on details, bond investors reacted quickly to the potential for giant government purchases of mortgage bonds.
In theory, if Fannie and Freddie again became a buyer of mortgage bonds, it would provide a new investor for those securities, pushing up the price of those mortgage bonds, and, in theory, might also help reduce mortgage rates broadly.
Fannie and Freddie are overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and its director, Bill Pulte, a stalwart ally of Mr. Trump.
The report noted that the Fed often calmed the markets by buying mortgage-backed bonds.","President Trump said he was ordering the two big government-controlled mortgage finance firms to start buying bonds backed by mortgages, his latest bid to make it easier for Americans to buy a home.

In a post on social media on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. While his announcement was short on details, bond investors reacted quickly to the potential for giant government purchases of mortgage bonds.

After the statement, the difference between the interest rates on mortgage bonds and Treasuries narrowed by 0.1 percentage points, a sharp move in that market and an early indication that the initiative could have some effect on the mortgage market.

Some analysts questioned the extent of the impact on consumer mortgage rates over time, given that those rates are influenced by a number of factors, including Federal Reserve policy.

Mr. Trump’s announcement is part of a recent effort by the White House to show it is responding to the public’s concerns about the cost of living and specifically the issue of housing affordability. It is an issue that could dog Republicans in this year’s midterm elections.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted Congress to bar big Wall Street firms from buying more single-family homes to operate as rental properties. Some housing experts have said institutional buyers of single-family homes have driven up home prices and led to higher rents in some communities.

Mr. Trump is also said to be considering asking Congress to permit home buyers to take money out of their retirement savings to pay for down payments.

A move by Fannie and Freddie to buy mortgage-backed securities would be a back-to-future moment of sorts. Buying risky mortgage-backed securities was one investment strategy that got the two firms in trouble in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, when many homeowners fell into default. The federal government was forced to step in and take them over to avoid bankruptcy.

The main job of Fannie and Freddie is to buy mortgages from banks and loans and package them into bonds that are sold to investors. In selling home loans to Fannie and Freddie so they can be packaged into bonds, banks and lenders are freed up to do more lending.

In theory, if Fannie and Freddie again became a buyer of mortgage bonds, it would provide a new investor for those securities, pushing up the price of those mortgage bonds, and, in theory, might also help reduce mortgage rates broadly. Bond prices move inversely to rates.

“There is no question if Fannie and Freddie get back into buying mortgage bonds for their portfolios, mortgage rates will undoubtedly fall,” said David Dworkin, president and chief executive officer of the National Housing Conference, a coalition of affordable housing providers.

Mr. Dworkin, a Treasury official during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said Mr. Trump’s idea was an intriguing one. But some mortgage analysts questioned how much of an impact it would have.

“This could have a small impact on affordability,” said Scott Buchta, head of fixed income strategy at Brean Capital, in emailed comments, with rates falling as much as 0.25 percentage points.

But he added that the move could give a boost to mortgage refinancing activity, which is still economically important.

The average 30-year mortgage rate stood at 6.23 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since September 2022, according to Bankrate.

Mr. Buchta said that if mortgage rates fell below 6 percent, that would be “a huge positive” for the psychology of the market.

Fannie and Freddie are overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and its director, Bill Pulte, a stalwart ally of Mr. Trump. One of the first things that Mr. Pulte did after being sworn into office last year was to appoint himself as the chairman of the boards of both companies.

“We are on it, Mr. President,” Mr. Pulte said Thursday on social media, responding to Mr. Trump’s proposal.

Just a few days ago, the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, published a report commenting on the fact that the big market for mortgage-backed securities was “operating without a net” because the Federal Reserve had reduced its role as buyer of last resort for mortgage bonds. The report noted that the Fed often calmed the markets by buying mortgage-backed bonds.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08biz-trump-mortgage-bonds-lcfg/08biz-trump-mortgage-bonds-lcfg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 19:03:23.872585

Winners and Losers in the Biotech Shakeup The primary winner in this transaction is undoubtedly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY).
By securing Ventyx’s oral platform, Lilly gains a technological edge over competitors who are still reliant on injectable immunology treatments.
Historically, this move mirrors Lilly’s previous successful acquisitions, such as the $2.4 billion purchase of Dice Therapeutics in 2023, which also focused on oral immunology.
Summary and Investor Outlook The acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences by Eli Lilly is a masterclass in strategic M&A, perfectly timed to coincide with Lilly's peak market influence and technical stock strength.","In a move that underscores the tightening intersection between metabolic health and systemic inflammation, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) officially announced on January 7, 2026, its definitive agreement to acquire Ventyx Biosciences (NASDAQ: VTYX) for approximately $1.2 billion. The all-cash transaction, priced at $14.00 per share, represents a significant 62% premium over Ventyx's 30-day volume-weighted average price. This acquisition marks a pivotal moment for Lilly as it seeks to fortify its immunology portfolio and explore the ""holy grail"" of drug development: the combination of weight-loss therapies with oral anti-inflammatory agents.

The immediate market reaction was swift and decisive. Shares of Ventyx Biosciences surged over 60% following the announcement, while Eli Lilly saw its stock jump 3.3% in early trading, clearing a critical technical resistance level of $1,080. For Lilly, which recently became the first healthcare entity to surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization in late 2025, the acquisition is seen as a strategic ""bolt-on"" that could yield exponential returns if Ventyx’s oral small-molecule pipeline successfully navigates upcoming Phase 2 readouts.

The Crown Jewels of the Ventyx Pipeline

The centerpiece of this deal is Ventyx’s portfolio of NLRP3 inhibitors, specifically VTX3232 and VTX2735. NLRP3 is a protein complex that acts as a ""master switch"" for the body's inflammatory response. VTX3232 is a central nervous system-penetrant inhibitor currently in Phase 2 trials for Parkinson’s disease and obesity-associated cardiometabolic diseases. Data released in late 2025 indicated that VTX3232 could reduce inflammation biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), by nearly 80% in patients with obesity. By acquiring this asset, Lilly aims to pair it with its blockbuster GLP-1 agonist, Zepbound (tirzepatide), to treat the underlying inflammation that often persists even after significant weight loss.

Beyond NLRP3, the acquisition brings tamuzimod (VTX002), an oral S1P1 receptor modulator in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and VTX958, a highly selective allosteric TYK2 inhibitor. These assets are designed to compete in the high-growth immunology market, where the shift from injectable biologics to convenient oral pills is rapidly accelerating. The timeline leading to this deal was catalyzed by Ventyx's successful mid-stage data in late 2025, which caught the eye of Lilly’s business development team as they looked for ways to diversify beyond their core diabetes and weight-loss franchises.

Winners and Losers in the Biotech Shakeup

The primary winner in this transaction is undoubtedly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). By securing Ventyx’s oral platform, Lilly gains a technological edge over competitors who are still reliant on injectable immunology treatments. The deal also validates Lilly's strategy of using its massive cash flow from GLP-1 sales to ""buy the future"" of the biotech sector. Ventyx shareholders are also clear victors, realizing a substantial premium after a volatile 2024 and 2025 for the small-cap biotech space.

Conversely, the ""losers"" or those under increased pressure include legacy immunology giants like AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY). AbbVie, which has long dominated the space with Humira and its successors Rinvoq and Skyrizi, now faces a formidable rival in Lilly that can offer a combined metabolic-immunology approach. Bristol Myers Squibb, which markets the TYK2 inhibitor Sotyktu, may see its market share threatened if Ventyx’s VTX958 proves to have a superior safety profile or better efficacy in Crohn's disease. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) may find itself playing catch-up in the ""inflammation-obesity nexus,"" as it currently lacks a comparable NLRP3 asset to pair with its own GLP-1, Wegovy.

A New Era of ""Oral Biologics"" and Metabolic Synergy

This acquisition fits into a broader industry trend toward ""oral biologics""—small molecules that offer the potency of traditional injectable antibodies but with the convenience of a daily pill. As the pharmaceutical sector moves toward 2030, the ability to provide oral treatments for complex autoimmune diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s is expected to be a major differentiator. The deal also highlights the growing realization that obesity is not just a metabolic condition but a chronic inflammatory state, suggesting that the next generation of ""super-blockbusters"" will likely be combination therapies.

Historically, this move mirrors Lilly’s previous successful acquisitions, such as the $2.4 billion purchase of Dice Therapeutics in 2023, which also focused on oral immunology. However, the Ventyx deal is more ambitious in its scope, targeting the CNS-penetrant NLRP3 pathway. Regulatory scrutiny is expected to be manageable, as the deal is relatively small for a company of Lilly’s size and does not present immediate antitrust concerns in any single therapeutic market, given that most of Ventyx's assets are still in the clinical stage.

Technical Breakout and the Path Ahead

From a technical perspective, Eli Lilly's stock is currently in a ""blue sky"" breakout phase. After consolidating between $700 and $800 for much of mid-2025, the stock surged through the $1,000 psychological barrier in November. The Ventyx announcement acted as a catalyst to push the stock toward its all-time high of $1,117. Analysts at major firms have already begun raising their 2026 price targets, with some forecasting a move toward $1,500 by year-end, contingent on the successful integration of Ventyx’s assets and continued growth in the GLP-1 market.

In the short term, investors should watch for Phase 2 data readouts for VTX3232 in Parkinson's and obesity, expected in mid-2026. These results will be the first real test of whether Lilly’s $1.2 billion bet will pay off. Long-term, the strategic pivot will require Lilly to successfully manage a sprawling pipeline that now touches everything from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s to IBD and obesity. The challenge will be maintaining the clinical momentum of these diverse assets without spreading its research and development resources too thin.

Summary and Investor Outlook

The acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences by Eli Lilly is a masterclass in strategic M&A, perfectly timed to coincide with Lilly's peak market influence and technical stock strength. By securing a leading position in the NLRP3 and TYK2 pathways, Lilly is not just expanding its immunology footprint; it is redefining the treatment paradigm for metabolic and inflammatory diseases.

For investors, the key takeaways are clear: Lilly is aggressively defending its $1 trillion valuation by diversifying its revenue streams. Moving forward, the market will be hyper-focused on the synergy between Zepbound and Ventyx’s anti-inflammatory molecules. As the ""obesity wars"" between Lilly and Novo Nordisk evolve into the ""inflammation wars,"" the ability to provide a comprehensive, oral, multi-disease solution will likely determine the next decade's healthcare leader. Watch for further consolidation in the small-cap biotech space as other pharmaceutical titans look to replicate Lilly's bold move.

These deposits represent onchain cash balances or depositor claims against the bank, issued on an in-house permissioned blockchain network. This development marks a significant step in the evolution of financial services, as institutions increasingly seek faster and more efficient asset movement with enhanced settlement certainty, transparency, and liquidity.

BNY Mellon's initiative is part of a broader trend among major financial institutions to integrate blockchain technology into traditional finance systems. As global financial markets transition to an always-on operating model, the demand for streamlined asset movement grows. The introduction of tokenized bank deposits is a response to this shift, aiming to reduce friction and unlock liquidity in financial transactions. This move aligns with the ongoing overhaul of legacy financial infrastructure to accommodate the digital age.

In a related development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have proposed a transition to 24/7 capital markets. Their joint statement, released in September 2025, suggests that expanding trading hours could better align U.S. markets with the global economy's evolving reality. The traditional financial system, reliant on intermediaries, does not operate during nights, weekends, or certain holidays, which can leave investors and traders unable to act when markets are closed.

Blockchain technology, by eliminating intermediaries and enabling round-the-clock operations, offers reduced settlement times, lower transaction costs, and decreased friction in cross-border commerce. Real-world asset tokenization (RWA) is a key component in facilitating 24/7 capital markets, allowing physical or traditional assets to be represented on a blockchain. This approach is particularly beneficial for traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate and collectibles. However, the SEC and CFTC have noted that while 24/7 onchain markets and tokenization are viable for certain asset classes, a universal approach may not be suitable for all. The financial industry continues to explore these innovations as it adapts to the demands of a digital economy.",https://public.bnbstatic.com/images/common/feed-og-image-2.png,N,,2026-01-09 17:14:48.075479

Spark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.
After an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.
Johnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.
Nvidia staffers ramp up responses Following Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.","An internal Nvidia email chain revealed how senior executives at the chip giant — including founder and CEO Jensen Huang — mobilized in response to customer criticism of a key product launch late last year.

The thread offers a glimpse into how the company responds to public backlash as it expands products designed for individual developers and researchers.

The thread, which Business Insider has seen, centered on the launch of DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for developers and researchers to build AI products and work on apps for data science, medicine, and other fields.

While much of Nvidia's business targets data center customers, Huang underscored Spark's significance in the thread, calling it the ""ultimate developer's platform — out of the box easy to run all NVIDIA.""

Spark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.

An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.

Anshel Sag, a Moor Insights & Strategy analyst who has tracked Nvidia launches for 15 years and was an early DGX Spark tester, said the company's long experience releasing graphics cards in the gaming industry — where products are routinely scrutinized — has made it adept at handling public feedback, with Huang typically keeping a close eye on new releases.

In recent years, the company has become even more reactive, Sag said, due to increased internal resources and ""sensitivity about the stock price and how negative sentiment can draw that down.""

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang steps into the fray

In the fall of last year, AstraZeneca executive director Justin Johnson wrote in a LinkedIn post that while the DGX Spark met performance and speed claims, the software experience was buggy and unstable.

After an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.

""Jump on x and say you will fix,"" he wrote.

Subsequently, an Nvidia engineer replied that the company had reached out to Johnson to resolve most of the issues, which were related to a version mismatch of CUDA, Nvidia's software that allows developers to build AI apps powered by its GPUs.

Johnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.

Nvidia staffers ramp up responses

Following Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.

Staffers tracked complaints and engaged directly with key critics who raised concerns about DGX Spark's performance, heating issues, and pricing.

Another incident involved the researcher Christopher Kouzios, who wrote on LinkedIn that he'd purchased DGX Spark to conduct medical research after his daughter died from a rare brain tumor, with the goal of studying cancer risk in his sons.

Kouzios said software incompatibility had rendered the system unusable and that he'd only received an automated acknowledgment 38 hours after filing a support ticket.

After an Nvidia executive flagged the post, team members said they were fixing the bug, according to the emails. The executive later circulated an updated post in which Kouzios lauded Nvidia's customer support.

""While the situation initially frustrated me, Nvidia's response time was exceptional,"" Kouzios told Business Insider. ""In more than 33 years working with large technology companies, I have never seen an organization respond that quickly to public technical feedback.""

It's often standard for hardware to ship without fully finished software, Sag said, adding that Nvidia tends to be more ""high-touch"" than other tech companies in fielding complaints — an approach that flows down from an exceptionally ""hands-on"" CEO.

Nvidia has previously faced some launch hiccups and early criticism for new products, such as its Blackwell rollout, which encountered manufacturing challenges.

While a CEO's involvement is notable and Nvidia's backchannel efforts appeared to placate critics, such an approach isn't without risks, another analyst said.

""C-suite engagement during product controversies has become more common in tech, particularly for founder-led companies,"" said Kate Holterhoff, a senior industry analyst at RedMonk. ""It can signal authenticity and accountability, but it also carries reputational risk if the response is perceived as defensive or dismissive.""",https://i.insider.com/696127a1832e0ef1ead77ac9?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 15:00:34.606467

Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.9%.","Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. PACB, popularly known as PacBio, announced a new community-developed method, CiFi, yesterday. It enables chromosome-scale, haplotype-resolved genome assemblies from a single sequencing run, even when sample material is limited.

It is worth mentioning that researchers in the Megan Dennis Laboratory at the University of California, Davis, showed how CiFi addresses long-standing limitations of short-read Hi-C by generating long, highly accurate reads that capture multiple chromatin interactions within a single molecule. The new method is expected to offer numerous advantages tailored to the requirements of genome biology, biodiversity studies and functional genomics.

The latest announcement is expected to significantly boost PacBio’s sequencing solutions business and strengthen its foothold in the niche space.

Trend in PACB Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, shares of the company lost nearly 4.2% till yesterday’s close.

Historically, the company has gained a top-line boost from its various product innovations and launches. Although the latest announcement is likely to be beneficial for PACB’s top-line growth in the future, the stock declined overall.

PacBio currently has a market capitalization of $615.9 million. It has a current ratio of 6.2 compared with the industry’s 2.3. In the last reported quarter, PACB delivered an earnings surprise of 25%.

Significance of PACB’s Latest Announcement

Per PacBio, CiFi delivers multi-contact reads and longer fragments by integrating chromatin conformation capture (3C) with its HiFi long-read sequencing. These fragments significantly increase the information content of proximity ligation experiments in a single Revio sequencing run.

PacBio also states that CiFi, when paired with Revio SPRQ chemistry, will likely be able to generate reference-quality assemblies using fewer cells, fewer libraries and fewer sequencing runs. This is expected to lower barriers for genome projects that have been limited by cost, complexity or sample availability.

Management believes that CiFi will likely expand PACB’s multiomics capabilities, increasing the capabilities of the HiFi sequencing systems without new hardware and unlock new customer use cases.

Industry Prospects in Favor of PacBio

Per a report by Grand View Research, the global sequencing market was estimated at $15,540.0 million in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $62,478.8 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 22.2%. Factors like the growing demand for gene therapy and a significant increase in demand for consumer genomics in recent years are likely to drive the market.

Given the market potential, the latest product availability is expected to provide a significant boost to PacBio’s business.

PACB’s Notable Developments

In November 2025, PacBio announced its third-quarter 2025 results, wherein it unveiled new SPRQ-Nx sequencing chemistry and consumables, which are expected to reduce sequencing costs by up to 40%. During the quarter, PACB launched an expanded PureTarget portfolio of long-read HiFi assays covering difficult-to-sequence genes in carrier screening, supporting throughput for up to 100,000 samples per Revio system per year.

The same month, PacBio announced that, through its partnership with Berry Genomics, the Sequel II CNDx system had received Class III Medical Device Registration approval from the National Medical Products Administration in China.

To quickly recap, the CalPrivacy Board created a Data Broker Enforcement Strike Force to investigate privacy violations by the data broker industry. Additionally, the Delete Act was created to provide a single mechanism for Californians to request their data be deleted from multiple brokers’ databases. The Delete Act requires data brokers to register and pay an annual fee which helps fund the development of the Delete Request and Opt-Out Platform (Drop). Failure to register as required leads to investigations (and fines) by the Strike Force and that is exactly what happened here.

A Texas limited liability company Rickenbacher Data LLC d/b/a/ Datamasters was fined $45,000 for failing to register as a data broker in violation of the Delete Act. Datamasters bought and resold the names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information of millions of people with Alzheimer’s disease, drug addiction and other health problems for targeted advertising. Additionally, as explained in the decision, Datamasters bought and resold lists of people based on age and race as evidenced by them offering “Senior Lists” and “Hispanic Lists,” as well as lists based on political views, grocery store purchases, health-related purchases and other identifiable means. This was all done while they failed to register with the California Data Broker Registry. The Agency found that while Datamasters tried to comply with California’s privacy laws at various points, those attempts were imperfect and “lacked sufficient written policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Delete Act….”

For failing to register as required by the Delete Act and complying with applicable privacy laws, the Agency fined Datamasters $42,000.00. The Agency reasoned that not only was this fine warranted because of the failure to register but the head of enforcement at CalPrivacy said that “reselling list of people battling Alzheimer’s disease is a recipe for trouble…in the wrong hands, these lists could be used to target people for more than just advertising and the same risks apply to selling lists of seniors…people who identify as conservative or liberal….” Not only was the fine warranted for not registering as required but given that such personal and intimate information of the most vulnerable members of society was being sold, ensuring that there was accountability was paramount for the Agency.

The second decision required a New York based provider of data and technology known as S&P Global, Inc. to pay a $62,000.00 fine for failing to register as a data broker. From the decision, the Agency found that S&P Global failed to register because of an administrative error as evidenced in the decision that read in part “S&P Global intended to register the company as a data broker for its 2024 activities and S&P Global believed that the registration had been completed….” An investigation was opened as to why S&P Global was not registered and after the company learned that they were being investigated, they quickly acted to complete the registration. However, because they were unregistered for 313 days, the Agency found that the fine was warranted and issued new terms to the company to ensure such oversight does not happen again (to which S&P Global agreed to). Those terms were adopting written policies and procedures to ensure timely registration as a data broker in compliance with the Delete Act and reviewing its procedures for auditing data broker registration status and update those audit procedures as the company deems appropriate to identify missing or incomplete registration.

While the second circumstance seems to be a good faith error as opposed to the first decision, both orders underscore the importance of adhering to the requirements posed by the Delete Act. California has taken a much more active approach in how they oversee the handling of people’s personal information and will look to hold data brokers accountable for any missteps regardless of the reason. These preventative measures are enacted to ensure that the most intimate details of people’s lives stay private unless they consent to disclose such information. California seeks to empower consumers with greater control over their personal data and ensuring compliance of requirements set forth in the Delete Act by the data brokers is a crucial component in empowering the public. These orders serve as a reminder to the companies that acquire and sell data that it is up to them to ensure that they are diligent in adhering to all the requirements.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2026-01/CCPA%20Compliance%20CPRA%20California%20Data%20Privacy.jpg.webp?itok=oG4PgQLc,N,,2026-01-09 14:02:35.396137

""With this deployment, we're not just processing data-we're creating a new asset class with national security-grade protection, opening revenue streams that could potential exceed $2 billion annually in this market alone.""

""These two larger deployments that include IBM's WatsonX.ai will be complemented by the Datavault AI and Available Infrastructure build out of 100 locations that each have estimated, and additional serviceable addressable markets (SAM) potential exceeding $100 million from each market. ""

The Datavault AI Edge Network activation will support multiple monetization channels, including:

Real-time quantum encrypted tokenization fees for converting enterprise data into tradable assets

GPU-backed AI processing for financial modeling, risk analytics, and fraud prevention

Per-event revenue from credentialing, identity scoring, and secure attestations

DataScore applications in advertising, compliance, and predictive analytics

Operation of private token exchanges within SanQtum's secure network

Looking Ahead

Datavault AI and Available Infrastructure look forward to expanding this national rollout and supporting additional customer deployments that benefit from secure communications, secure storage, near-edge compute, and secure data processing. As coverage scales across the U.S., the companies expect the combined infrastructure footprint to help accelerate trusted tokenization, exchange, and valuation workflows by placing cybersecure edge nodes closer to where data is generated and decisions are made.

In late 2025, the company was rocked by the ""Martin Bally Scandal,"" involving leaked recordings of a high-ranking executive making disparaging remarks about the company's own products and employees.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) has fared even worse, announcing a massive plan to split into two independent companies by late 2026 in a desperate bid to unlock value from its aging portfolio.
However, the 2025–2026 period has shattered that precedent.
However, with the snacks division itself seeing a 5% organic decline in late 2025, the ""snack-led growth"" thesis is under immense pressure.","In a move that has further dampened investor sentiment, a top executive at The Campbell’s Company (NYSE: CPB) has offloaded a significant portion of his holdings just as the consumer staples giant closes out one of its most challenging years in recent history. Charles A. Brawley III, the company’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel, sold approximately $325,000 worth of stock in late December 2025, according to recent regulatory filings. The transaction occurred as the stock price languished near decade-lows, highlighting a growing disconnect between the firm's leadership and its long-term equity value.

The timing of the sale is particularly conspicuous, coming on the heels of a 33% decline in share price over the past 12 months. As of early January 2026, Campbell’s is grappling with a perfect storm of internal reputational crises, a difficult leadership transition, and a broader industry-wide shift where consumers are increasingly abandoning legacy national brands in favor of cheaper private-label alternatives. For a company that has spent over a century as a cornerstone of the American pantry, the current trajectory suggests a fundamental identity crisis that a simple rebranding to ""The Campbell’s Company"" has yet to solve.

A Legal Chief’s Exit Amidst a 52-Week Low

The specific transaction, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 31, 2025, involved the sale of 11,550 shares by Charles A. Brawley III at an average price of $28.14 per share. This divestment represented roughly 21% of Brawley’s direct holdings in the company. While executive sales are often planned in advance for tax or diversification purposes, the decision to execute a trade at a price point nearly 35% lower than its January 2025 peak of $44.00 has raised eyebrows among market analysts.

The timeline leading up to this sale has been marred by a series of operational and PR setbacks. In late 2025, the company was rocked by the ""Martin Bally Scandal,"" involving leaked recordings of a high-ranking executive making disparaging remarks about the company's own products and employees. The fallout from these comments led to immediate consumer boycotts and regulatory inquiries from state attorneys general regarding food labeling and manufacturing processes. This internal turmoil coincided with the first full year under CEO Mick Beekhuizen, who took the helm in early 2025 following the departure of Mark Clouse. Beekhuizen’s tenure has so far been defined by a ""muted"" growth outlook and a struggle to maintain the momentum of the company’s snacks division.

Initial market reactions to the insider selling and the year-end financial performance have been pessimistic. Major brokerages, including UBS and RBC, have slashed their price targets for CPB to the $26–$27 range, citing deteriorating gross margins. In its Q1 2026 earnings report, Campbell’s revealed a 3.4% decline in revenue, with margins squeezed to 29.9% due to rising supply chain costs and the impact of new tariffs on steel and aluminum—essential materials for the company’s iconic soup cans.

The Rise of the Store Brand: Winners and Losers

While Campbell’s struggles, the primary ""winners"" in the current environment are not its traditional rivals, but rather the retail giants and their private-label brands. As of 2025, store-brand sales reached a record high of $277 billion. Consumers, battered by years of cumulative inflation, have permanently shifted their spending habits. Retailers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) are seeing their ""Great Value"" and ""Kirkland Signature"" lines capture market share that legacy brands like Campbell's may never recover.

In contrast, Campbell’s direct competitors are also feeling the heat. General Mills (NYSE: GIS) and Conagra Brands (NYSE: CAG) have both reported significant volume declines as they attempt to pass on higher costs to a price-sensitive public. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) has fared even worse, announcing a massive plan to split into two independent companies by late 2026 in a desperate bid to unlock value from its aging portfolio. The collective ""Big Food"" sector is currently viewed by investors as a ""value trap,"" with the entire group trading at multi-year lows as they fail to compete with the perceived value and improving quality of generic alternatives.

Broader Industry Trends and the ""War on Sugar""

The decline of Campbell’s fits into a larger, more ominous trend for the packaged food industry. In early 2026, federal regulators introduced aggressive new dietary guidelines that have been colloquially termed the ""War on Sugar and Processed Foods."" These policy shifts have placed a target on the back of any company reliant on highly processed, high-sodium, or sugar-laden products. For Campbell’s, whose portfolio is heavily weighted toward shelf-stable soups and salty snacks like Goldfish, the regulatory environment is becoming increasingly hostile.

Historically, companies like Campbell’s were considered ""recession-proof"" defensive plays. However, the 2025–2026 period has shattered that precedent. The combination of high interest rates, which make the dividend yields of these companies less attractive compared to bonds, and the fundamental shift in consumer health consciousness has removed the traditional safety net. We are seeing a historical pivot similar to the decline of ""Big Tobacco"" in the late 20th century, where legacy giants must either radically reinvent their product lines or face a slow, painful contraction.

Strategic Pivots and the Road Ahead

Looking forward, Campbell’s faces a grueling path to recovery. In the short term, the company is doubling down on a $375 million cost-saving program intended to run through 2028. Investors should expect a series of strategic divestitures as the company looks to trim ""non-core"" brands and focus on its high-margin snacking business. However, with the snacks division itself seeing a 5% organic decline in late 2025, the ""snack-led growth"" thesis is under immense pressure.

One potential scenario is a more aggressive move into the ""fresh"" or ""organic"" categories, though such a pivot would require significant capital expenditure at a time when the company’s balance sheet is already strained. Another possibility is that Campbell’s becomes a target for private equity or a larger conglomerate looking to consolidate the struggling packaged food space. For any turnaround to succeed, the company must first address the reputational damage from the Bally scandal and prove to consumers that its products are compatible with modern health standards.

Final Assessment: A Watchful Eye on the Pantry

The $325,000 stock sale by Charles A. Brawley III may be small in the context of the company’s total market cap, but it serves as a potent symbol of the internal uncertainty plaguing the firm. When the chief legal officer reduces his stake while the stock is at a decade-low, it sends a message that the bottom may not yet be in. The 33% decline over the past year is not merely a market correction; it is a reflection of a company struggling to find its footing in a world that is moving away from the canned-goods era.

Moving forward, investors should watch for the company's Q2 2026 earnings and any further updates on the ""War on Sugar"" regulatory front. The ability of Campbell’s to stabilize its margins in the face of persistent tariff pressures will be the litmus test for its survival as a standalone entity. For now, the ""Mmm-Mmm Good"" era of the 20th century feels like a distant memory, replaced by the harsh reality of a 21st-century retail landscape that demands more than just nostalgia.

In a fast-moving creative industry, knowing when not to rush is a competitive advantage.","Every January, the industry slips into anxiety. Declarations pile up on timelines. You see new strategies, bold announcements, and huge promises. Everyone appears to be “coming back stronger” or “redefining their direction.” Indeed, the volume is remarkable as urgency spreads.

If you have worked long enough in advertising or creative work, a pattern becomes clear. Specifically, the people who move fastest in January rarely shape the year. Urgency often masks nervousness. It reflects the fear of getting left behind. Furthermore, it shows the need to signal progress before substance exists.

The Psychology of the January Rush

January amplifies this feeling because it follows rest and reflection. Silence feels risky. In fact, stillness feels like a loss of relevance. However, experienced creatives understand something different. Creative power does not come from volume. Instead, it comes from orientation.

January is not a month for proof. Rather, it is a month for recalibration. Confidence does not return on its own after time away from clients and deadlines. Consequently, it requires reconnection. The smartest professionals do not rush back into output. They pause and observe. They clean up systems and refine thinking. Ultimately, they realign priorities before acting.

Strategic Patience vs. Speed

This approach does not signal hesitation. Instead, it signals control. In brand work, pressure often looks like ambition. Tight timelines and constant visibility create the illusion that speed equals seriousness. But speed without direction only creates noise. Noise does not create impact.

The creatives who endure focus on structure, not momentum. They revisit ideas that once mattered. They refine concepts developed in haste. Moreover, they strengthen existing relationships instead of chasing new ones. What looks like slowness often reflects strategic patience.

January rewards restraint. This is when professionals set boundaries before calendars fill up. Senior creatives know that January commitments often become mid-year regrets. Therefore, they choose carefully. They do not act from scarcity, but from clarity about capacity. This selectiveness reflects self-awareness, not arrogance.

The Power of Maintenance and Uncertainty

The industry rarely celebrates maintenance. Yet, maintenance preserves creative strength. Teams align systems and simplify processes. They reduce friction before pressure builds. These actions attract no applause, but they compound over time.

Reinvention rarely arrives through grand announcements. Instead, it unfolds through small, deliberate shifts across the year. Respected creatives do not reinvent their identities each January. Rather, they deepen them.

The ability to sit with uncertainty remains an undervalued skill. January often feels unclear. Direction remains fluid. While less experienced creatives rush to escape discomfort through activity, experienced ones allow uncertainty to work. They trust interaction over force.

Building a Competitive Advantage

Ironically, those who resist urgency often move ahead. Their thinking sharpens and their output strengthens. Also, their energy lasts longer. While others chase momentum in January, they quietly build foundations. This marks the difference between starting fast and starting well.

If January feels slower than expected, it may not signal failure. In fact, it may show awareness of energy, craft, and long-term intent. In a fast-moving creative industry, knowing when not to rush is a competitive advantage. The people who thrive rarely shout urgency. Instead, they move with intent.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image_fx-1-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 13:00:40.607093

The monitor uses next-generation V-stripe QD-OLED technology to improve clarity and reduce fringing. Its ultrawide 21:9 WQHD format, 360 Hz refresh rate, and rapid pixel transitions contribute to fluid motion tracking. HyperX ProLuma extends the panel’s color management capability, while 100 W USB-C power delivery and a built-in KVM switch accommodate multi-device workflows. Users can customize the display further with 3D-printable accessories, such as a headphone hook. HyperX OLED CoreProtect manages panel health during prolonged operation.

The HyperX Clutch Tachi expands HP’s gaming input portfolio with a leverless Xbox-licensed controller. Magnetic switches with TMR sensors support fast actuation, while Ngenuity software enables configuration of button behavior, rapid-trigger adjustments, and personalized layouts. The design also supports 3D-printed modifications for users who want custom button shapes or unique artwork.

HyperX is also collaborating with Neurable to develop a headset that interprets brain activity in real time. This collaboration explores how neurotechnology and AI may support player focus and accuracy during gameplay.

All new HyperX products begin rolling out in the spring, with pricing details scheduled for announcement closer to launch.

What do we think?

Together, HP’s announcements at CES 2026 sketched a clear picture of where the company intends to go next. Its new AI-focused notebooks show a commitment to meeting the practical needs of modern workers who move constantly, depend on local intelligence, and require systems that stay secure and serviceable through heavy daily use. The merger of Omen and HyperX signals a parallel shift in gaming, bringing hardware, peripherals, displays, and software into a single ecosystem shaped around player behavior rather than separate product lines. The new systems and accessories emphasize responsiveness, thermal stability, visual clarity, and deeper personalization, giving both competitive and casual players tools that adapt to their pace. HP’s exploration of neurotechnology through its partnership with Neurable adds another dimension, hinting at experiences that react not just to inputs but to the player’s cognitive state. With these combined efforts, HP moves into 2026 with a unified strategy built around mobility, intelligence, and user-directed design.",https://www.jonpeddie.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hp-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 13:00:21.466850

On January 7, Michael Yee from UBS initiated coverage of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $1,080 to $1,250. The analyst noted the company’s leadership in the obesity treatment market as one of the key factors behind his bullish sentiment.

The firm highlighted that the company’s performance in 2026 would be driven by the anticipated approval of obesity drug Orfo. The approval of the drug seems imminent as Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) filed for regulatory approval in early December. The firm also believes that the approval could lead the company to exceed Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2026-2028. Moreover, UBS also cited that Medicare coverage for obesity treatments is expected to begin in 2026. This coverage is anticipated to help the company boost adoption of its approved and upcoming obesity treatments.

That said, earlier on January 5, Leerink Partners also raised the price target on the stock from $1,104 to $1,234 and maintained a Buy rating. Leerink Partners also cited the upcoming launch of Orfo as one of the tailwinds boosting the company’s long-term potential.

Today, we are looking at diversified banks stocks, starting with PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC).

At their core, diversified banks take in deposits and engage in various forms of lending, which means revenue is generated through interest rate spreads (difference between loan and deposit rates) and fees. Other revenue comes from adjacent services such as wealth management, card and account fees, and products such as annuities. These institutions benefit from rising interest rates that improve NIMs (net interest margins), digital transformation reducing operational costs, and expanding wealth management services as populations age. However, they face headwinds including fintech competition disrupting traditional models (how disruptive is crypto?), stringent regulatory requirements increasing compliance costs, and cybersecurity threats requiring substantial technology investments. Economic downturns also pose risks through potential loan defaults and compressed margins during accommodative monetary policy periods.

The 7 diversified banks stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.3%.

Luckily, diversified banks stocks have performed well with share prices up 18% on average since the latest earnings results.

Following the transaction close, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. expects to change its name to Callaway Golf Co. within 30 days.
“We expect Callaway will generate consistent free operating cash flow (FOCF) despite the sale of Topgolf.","“Our leverage assessment incorporates a significant reduction in finance and operating lease liabilities associated with separating the Topgolf business, given the limited lease exposure of the company’s remaining core operations. In addition, all deemed landlord financing obligations and venue-level financing liabilities related to Topgolf are expected to transfer with that business.

“The sale of Topgolf reduces the scale, profitability level, and diversification of stand-alone Callaway. We forecast total consolidated sales of approximately $2.1 billion in 2026, compared with approximately $3.9 billion in 2025 for the combined entity, reflecting the divestitures of both Jack Wolfskin and Topgolf. Therefore, we revised our assessment of the company’s business risk profile to weak from fair.

“Despite the reduction in absolute scale, we expect the company’s golf equipment and apparel segments to demonstrate stable demand trends, supporting low-single-digit percent year-over-year revenue growth for stand-alone Callaway. We anticipate elevated tariff-related input costs will partially pressure profitability, limiting margin expansion. As a result, we forecast S&P Global Ratings–adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 12.0% in 2026 and 12.2% in 2027, corresponding to adjusted EBITDA of roughly $255 million and $265 million, respectively.

“Callaway has repositioned its operating model as a pure-play golf equipment and apparel company focused on its core product offerings. Callaway has simplified its business model following the divestiture of its Topgolf entertainment segment. By exiting a capital-intensive, venue-based operating model, the company is concentrating on its traditional strengths in golf equipment and active lifestyle products, which should simplify operations and improve visibility into earnings and cash flow. The remaining portfolio consists of Callaway Golf, Odyssey, TravisMathew, and OGIO, representing established brands with market recognition and pricing power across golf clubs, balls, apparel, and accessories.

“In our view, this streamlined structure enhances management’s ability to prioritize product innovation, control costs, and allocate capital more efficiently. It also reduces exposure to discretionary entertainment spending and execution risk associated with physical venue expansion. Following the transaction close, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. expects to change its name to Callaway Golf Co. within 30 days.

“We expect Callaway will generate consistent free operating cash flow (FOCF) despite the sale of Topgolf. As of the end of the third quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2025), the company had roughly $866 million of cash on hand and $427 million available across its U.S and international asset-based lending (ABL) facilities. We project the stand-alone Callaway will generate reported FOCF of around $150 million annually after capital expenditure (capex) of about $40 million–a steep reduction in capital spending compared with $300 million for the former combined entity. We expect most of its capex will fund technology investments, improve existing stores, and support expansion. The company does not face any near-term maturities, with its ABL facilities maturing in 2028 and its term loan facility maturing in 2030.

“The positive outlook reflects our view that we could raise our ratings on Callaway over the next 12 months if we expect S&P Global Ratings-adjusted leverage sustained below 2x.”",,N,,2026-01-09 14:03:09.991932

The reaffirmed positive sentiment from analysts has arrived alongside solid recent momentum, with a 90 day share price return of 26.49% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 42.68%, suggesting interest in Parker Hannifin’s long term potential is building.

With the shares up strongly over the past year, trading around $906.47 and sitting only a few percent below an average analyst price target, the key question now is simple: is Parker Hannifin still undervalued, or is the market already factoring in the next leg of growth?

Compared with the last close at $906.47, the most followed narrative sees fair value closer to $907.86, with that view resting on specific growth, margin and valuation assumptions.

Introduction

In the volatile world of global fashion, few brands have successfully navigated the treacherous transition from ubiquitous department-store apparel to genuine luxury prestige. As of early 2026, Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) stands as the preeminent example of this ""premiumization"" masterclass. While many of its North American peers have struggled with brand dilution and heavy discounting, Ralph Lauren has spent the last five years executing a disciplined ""Next Great Chapter"" strategy that has fundamentally re-rated the stock in the eyes of Wall Street. Today, the company is no longer viewed merely as a maker of polo shirts, but as a lifestyle titan with significant pricing power and an expanding footprint in the high-growth Asian markets. With the stock trading near all-time highs and a new three-year strategic plan currently in its first year of implementation, RL remains one of the most compelling narratives in the consumer discretionary sector.

Historical Background

The Ralph Lauren story began in 1967 with a single collection of men’s ties, sold under the ""Polo"" label by a young entrepreneur with no formal fashion training. Ralph Lauren’s vision was never just about clothing; it was about the ""American Dream""—an aspirational mix of Ivy League tradition, English aristocracy, and Western ruggedness. The company expanded rapidly in the 1970s and 80s, becoming the first American designer to open a free-standing boutique on New York’s Madison Avenue.

The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997. For much of the early 2000s, Ralph Lauren expanded its reach through extensive licensing and a heavy reliance on wholesale partners like Macy’s (NYSE: M). However, this strategy eventually led to brand over-exposure and excessive discounting. The turning point arrived in 2017 with the appointment of Patrice Louvet, a veteran from Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), who partnered with the founder to initiate a radical multi-year transformation aimed at elevating the brand and reclaiming its luxury status.

Business Model

Ralph Lauren operates a vertically integrated business model that balances global scale with localized agility. The company’s revenue is generated through three primary channels:

Direct-to-Consumer (DTC): This is the core of the company’s modern strategy, comprising owned retail stores and a robust e-commerce platform. In late 2025, DTC accounted for nearly two-thirds of total revenue, up significantly from previous years.

Wholesale: This includes sales to premier department stores and specialty retailers. The company has deliberately reduced its wholesale footprint—particularly in ""off-price"" channels—to preserve brand equity.

Licensing: While smaller in terms of direct revenue, licensing allows the brand to extend into lifestyle categories like fragrances, eyewear, and home furnishings through partnerships with experts in those fields.

Geographically, Ralph Lauren is a global powerhouse. While North America remains its largest market, Europe and Asia (particularly Greater China) have become the primary engines of margin-accretive growth, with Asia now representing the most profitable segment on a per-unit basis.

Stock Performance Overview

Ralph Lauren has been a standout performer in the ""post-pandemic"" era, delivering exceptional returns for shareholders who recognized its structural shift early.

1-Year Performance: Over the past twelve months, RL has gained approximately 58%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and the broader retail index.

5-Year Performance: Investors who bought in 2021 have seen their holdings nearly triple. The stock’s rally accelerated in late 2024 as the market began to reward RL's consistent earnings beats and margin expansion.

10-Year Performance: On a decade-long horizon, the stock reflects the ""V-shaped"" recovery of the brand—from a period of stagnation in 2015-2017 to a powerhouse trajectory starting in late 2022. As of January 2026, RL is trading near $360, up from the sub-$100 levels seen during the depths of the 2020 market cycle.

Financial Performance

PredictStreet’s analysis of Ralph Lauren’s most recent fiscal results (ending mid-2025) reveals a company operating at peak efficiency.

Revenue Growth: Fiscal year 2025 revenue reached $7.10 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year. This growth was notably achieved despite a deliberate 10% reduction in sales to off-price wholesale channels.

Operating Margins: Adjusted operating margins climbed to 14.0% in 2025, a 150-basis-point expansion from the prior year. This was driven by a cumulative 60% increase in Average Unit Retail (AUR) over the last five years.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): The company reported adjusted EPS of $12.33 in 2025, a 20% increase over 2024.

Balance Sheet: Ralph Lauren maintains a fortress balance sheet with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and a net cash position. This liquidity has supported a consistent dividend and aggressive share buybacks, totaling over $600 million in the last fiscal year.

Leadership and Management

The leadership at Ralph Lauren is defined by a unique partnership between creative vision and operational discipline.

Patrice Louvet (President & CEO): Louvet has been the architect of the brand’s financial turnaround. His ""Next Great Chapter"" plans have prioritized digital transformation, marketing ROI, and geographic optimization.

Ralph Lauren (Executive Chairman & Chief Creative Officer): At 86, the founder remains the soul of the company. He continues to oversee every creative aspect of the brand, ensuring that the ""lifestyle"" narrative remains coherent across all product lines.

Justin Picicci (CFO): Appointed in 2024, Picicci has maintained a strict focus on inventory management and capital allocation, earning him high marks from the analyst community.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Ralph Lauren’s product strategy is built on a ""tiered"" architecture that captures the full spectrum of the luxury market:

Luxury Pinnacle: The Purple Label and Ralph Lauren Collection (Women’s) compete with the likes of Hermes and Loro Piana. These lines have seen double-digit growth as the ""quiet luxury"" trend remains a dominant force in 2026.

Core Polo: The Polo Ralph Lauren brand has been successfully elevated, with a focus on icons like the cable-knit sweater and the Oxford shirt.

Category Expansion: The ""Next Great Chapter: Drive"" plan, launched in late 2025, focuses on expanding underpenetrated high-margin categories, specifically handbags, outerwear, and home decor.

Innovation: The company has integrated AI into its supply chain to predict demand at a hyper-local level, reducing markdowns and improving full-price sell-through rates.

Competitive Landscape

In the current market, Ralph Lauren is increasingly compared to European luxury conglomerates rather than its traditional American rivals.

vs. PVH Corp (NYSE: PVH): While PVH (owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein) has struggled with wholesale reliance in North America, RL has pivoted more aggressively to DTC.

vs. Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) and Capri Holdings (NYSE: CPRI): Tapestry (Coach) and Capri (Michael Kors) have focused on ""accessible luxury,"" which has proven more susceptible to macro-economic headwinds. Ralph Lauren’s more diversified lifestyle brand and higher price points have shielded it from the volatility seen by these handbag-centric firms.

Market Share: RL has successfully gained share in the ""premium menswear"" and ""luxury sportswear"" categories, particularly in Western Europe and the Tier-1 cities of China.

Industry and Market Trends

Several macro trends are currently favoring the Ralph Lauren business model:

Brand Elevation/Quiet Luxury: The shift away from loud logos toward timeless, high-quality garments plays directly into Ralph Lauren’s core aesthetic.

Asian Middle-Class Growth: Despite broader macro concerns in China, the demand for ""classic Americana"" remains robust among the Chinese upper-middle class, where RL is perceived as a top-tier aspirational brand.

Digital/Physical Integration: The ""Win in Key Cities"" strategy uses flagship ""World of Ralph Lauren"" stores (including Ralph’s Coffee shops) to drive both physical and digital sales within a 50-mile radius, a model that has significantly boosted customer lifetime value.

Risks and Challenges

Despite the current momentum, several risks remain:

Macro-Economic Sensitivity: A significant global recession would likely dampen demand for even premium luxury goods, particularly in the ""Lauren"" and ""Polo"" segments which have more exposure to aspirational (vs. ultra-high-net-worth) consumers.

Tariff and Trade Policy: With evolving US trade policies in 2025 and 2026, any major increase in tariffs on goods from Asia could pressure gross margins, although the company has diversified its sourcing away from China (now less than 20% of production).

Succession Planning: While the company has a deep bench of professional talent, the eventual departure of Ralph Lauren himself—whose personal brand is inextricably linked to the company—poses a long-term narrative risk.

Opportunities and Catalysts

Looking forward to the remainder of 2026 and 2027, several catalysts could drive further upside:

Handbag Penetration: Handbags currently represent a small fraction of RL’s revenue compared to peers like Coach or Gucci. The 2025 launch of the ""RL 888"" and ""Polo ID"" collections represents a major push into this high-margin category.

China Recovery: If the Chinese economy sees a broader stimulus-led recovery in 2026, RL is better positioned than almost any other US retailer to capture that upside.

Earnings Consistency: The company has a multi-year streak of beating analyst estimates. Continued execution of the ""Drive"" strategy (FY26-FY28) targets another 100-150 bps of margin expansion.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Sentiment on Wall Street is overwhelmingly positive. As of January 9, 2026, a majority of analysts covering RL maintain a ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" rating.

Price Targets: Recent targets from major institutions range from $400 to $435, suggesting a 10-20% upside from current levels.

Institutional Activity: There has been a notable increase in institutional ownership from ""quality"" and ""growth"" oriented funds over the last 18 months, shifting away from the ""value"" funds that previously dominated the shareholder base.

PredictStreet View: Our AI-generated earnings models suggest RL is well-positioned to exceed the consensus EPS of $13.50 for the current fiscal year, driven by stronger-than-expected holiday performance and continued AUR growth.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Ralph Lauren is navigating a complex regulatory environment:

ESG and Sustainability: The company is under increasing pressure from EU regulations regarding textile recycling and supply chain transparency. RL has committed to 100% sustainably sourced key materials by 2030, a goal that requires significant R&D investment.

Geopolitics: The ""China+1"" sourcing strategy is nearly complete, with increased production in Vietnam, India, and Turkey, mitigating the risk of sudden geopolitical shifts in East Asia.

Conclusion

Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) has successfully navigated the most difficult era in modern retail by doubling down on brand heritage while modernizing its operational backbone. By choosing to sell fewer items at higher prices and focusing on direct relationships with consumers, management has transformed the company from a cyclical apparel play into a structural luxury winner.

For investors, RL represents a rare combination of top-line growth, margin expansion, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. While the stock's valuation is no longer ""cheap"" by historical standards, it remains attractive relative to European luxury peers and reflects a business that is fundamentally more profitable and resilient than it was a decade ago. Investors should watch for the upcoming Q3 earnings report (February 2026) for confirmation that the ""Drive"" strategic plan is delivering on its handbag and outerwear expansion goals.

(NG) announces that Donlin Gold LLC (“Donlin Gold”), which is owned 60% by NOVAGOLD and 40% by Paulson Advisers LLC (“Paulson”), and Glenfarne Alaska LNG, LLC (“Glenfarne”), majority owner and developer of the Alaska LNG Project (“Alaska LNG”), signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) for natural gas supply from the Alaska LNG Pipeline and the development of the infrastructure needed to deliver the gas and power the proposed mine.

Under the LOI, Glenfarne and Donlin Gold will continue to evaluate ways to formalize a potential natural gas sales agreement for up to 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and cooperate on the most effective method for development and construction of the Donlin Gold natural gas pipeline. The pipeline extends from Southcentral Alaska to the Donlin Gold project in Southwest Alaska and will feed a power plant to supply electricity to the proposed mine.

“A reliable, secure supply of economic natural gas from Alaska LNG has the potential to substantially enhance our ability to unlock value and upside potential in Donlin Gold,” said John Paulson, President of Paulson. “Glenfarne’s global energy experience is well-suited to provide a long-term turnkey energy solution that helps advance this opportunity.”

“Powering Donlin Gold with natural gas from Alaska LNG could offer major advantages for the proposed mine and the Southwestern Alaska region by harnessing the strategic potential of such an important gold endowment for the industry and the United States,” said Greg Lang, NOVAGOLD’s President and CEO. “Aligning Alaska LNG and Donlin Gold’s pipeline schedules could reduce fuel costs, optimize transportation and logistics, streamline material procurement, and leverage shared expertise to lower overall project expenses.”

“Alaska LNG offers abundant low-cost natural gas that will enhance the economics and facilitate development of energy-intensive mining projects in Alaska,” said Glenfarne Alaska LNG President Adam Prestidge. “We have great confidence in the future success of Donlin Gold following the significant investment by Paulson. Adding a foundational customer like Donlin Gold, one of the largest known undeveloped gold deposits in the world, Alaska LNG provides significant volume discount benefits that will result in lower energy costs for Alaska consumers. As we continue to add more pipeline customers, the cost of gas for Alaskans will continue to go down.”

Donlin Gold Natural Gas Pipeline & Permitting

As per the 2021 Technical Report (as defined below) and the S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary (as defined below), Donlin Gold envisions a buried, 316-mile natural gas pipeline from an existing 20-inch natural gas pipeline near Beluga, Alaska to the Donlin Gold mine site to supply reliable, lower-carbon emitting, energy for mining operations. Key federal and state permits for the pipeline route have been issued. Recently the State of Alaska Supreme Court upheld the Alaska Department Natural Resources issuance of the pipeline right-of-way lease. Supplemental environmental review is ongoing under the Fixing America’s Transportation Act (“FAST-41”) program, coordinated by the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leading a court-directed Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement.

Donlin Gold Bankable Feasibility Study Update

Donlin Gold continues to advance the selection of a prime contractor for the Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS), having received proposals from leading engineering firms with the expertise required to design what is expected to be the largest single gold mine in the United States. A prime contractor is expected to be selected in the first quarter of 2026. In parallel, requests for proposals have been issued for specialist contractors covering the power plant, pipeline, and pressure oxidation and oxygen plant scopes of work, which will be incorporated into the BFS. Upon completion of the contractor selection process, a detailed timeline and budget for completion of the BFS will be established. Final construction approvals remain subject to completion of the environmental review, permitting, and the BFS.

The company has more than 120 years of history in lighting, under parent company Signify, formerly Philips Lighting and Philips. Now, Genlyte is the maker of a wide scope of professional lighting—from office and retail projects to Broadway shows to illuminating monumental landmarks.

Kevin Poyck, president and CEO of the Bridgewater, New Jersey-based unit spoke with Chief Executive to share the company’s roots and its strategy for moving forward.

Tell us about Signify’s Genlyte Solutions business, your history and how the company has grown.

Genlyte Solutions, a Signify business, has a 120-plus year legacy of lighting innovation and manufacturing in the U.S. and Canada, as well as Mexico and Central America. We are committed to unlocking the extraordinary potential of light for professional customers in the region.

Our collection of cutting-edge indoor and outdoor luminaires, LED lamps and electronics, and connected lighting systems and controls are designed to enhance well-being and performance, elevate experiences and advance sustainability—supporting brighter lives and a better world.

Among our trusted brands are Color Kinetics, which illuminates prominent buildings, bridges and landmarks; Vari-Lite, which lights concert tours, theater productions and large-scale entertainment events; and Philips, known for its high-quality and energy-efficient LED lamps.

To offer a bit of history: Signify is the world leader in lighting for professional and consumer customers. The company, founded as Philips in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, has led the lighting industry since 1891. Following the separation from Philips in 2016, we are now known as Signify.

Genlyte is a professional lighting business, focused on the North American market. Genlyte is fully responsible for its end-to-end processes including offer development, manufacturing, sales and marketing. The Genlyte name is not new to the company or lighting and electrical industries. Many of our luminaire brands come from Philips’ acquisition of Genlyte Group in 2008.

Over the last two years, our focus has been on distinguishing the Genlyte business and re-establishing our brands’ identities in the market given their strong legacies. We continue to strengthen our selling partnerships and invest, for example, in our digital capabilities, so we can best support our customers—along every stage of their project.

What do your U.S. manufacturing operations look like?

Genlyte operates three manufacturing facilities: two in Pennsylvania—a factory in Littlestown and a foundry in New Oxford—as well as a factory in Dallas, Texas.

Our Littlestown facility is best known for its production of our Hadco urban outdoor and landscape lighting solutions. We also manufacture at this site a robust portfolio of indoor and outdoor lighting products that meet domestic preference requirements, in line with the Build America, Buy America Act and Buy American Act.

In addition, Littlestown has become the manufacturing hub of our 3D printed lighting portfolio, encompassing decorative pendants, high and low bays, tracks and downlight accessories veracious under Genlyte’s Lightolier and Day-Brite CFI brands.

3D printing, as a manufacturing method, offers numerous benefits. The technology gives our customers the freedom to create their own unique designs, whether to suit a specific brand experience or space, in a timely and cost-effective manner. It supports a circular economy and sustainability; we use recyclable and bio-based materials and even waste like fishing nets.

Compared to traditional luminaires, 3D printed lighting fixtures don’t use paint or glue, and require fewer parts and screws, so they can be easily disassembled for reuse. Plus, they are produced on demand, reducing lead times, limiting waste and preventing large stock storage.

In our Dallas facility, we design and manufacture our Vari-Lite moving lights for the entertainment industry, along with control and power systems for theatres. These products make their way to Broadway productions, school and university theaters, and on tour with global artists.

Our people are at the heart of our U.S., and entire North America, manufacturing operations. Their health and well-being are our top priorities; we have strong programs in place to drive a safety culture. We invest in continuous learning and development, as well, so we build on our strong legacy while leading, challenging and shaping the future—for our business, Signify, the industry and the world we live in.

How about your operations in Canada and elsewhere?

Genlyte operates two manufacturing facilities in Canada: in Boisbriand, Quebec, home to our Lumec outdoor lighting brand; and in Langley, British Colombia, home to our Ledalite indoor architectural lighting brand. Both surpassed milestone anniversaries—50 and 40 years, respectively.

We also have two manufacturing facilities in Mexico—in Camargo, Chihuahua and in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon—as well as a robust regional distribution center network across North America with ready-made lighting stock available.

There are several other foundational elements to our manufacturing operations, one being our lean capabilities. Our sites are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to improve the level of quality and service we are delivering to our customers. So much so, Signify hosts an annual, global competition in which teams share their lean best practices and encourage replication throughout the entire company.

Another is sustainability. Our sustainable operations program focuses on reducing our carbon footprint. We employ energy-efficiency measures, including using 100 percent renewable energy. We also strive to minimize the amount of manufacturing waste that ends up in landfills; we achieved our commitment of sending zero waste to landfill at the end of 2024. We also engage with our suppliers and logistics and transport partners to drive their own emissions reductions.

How do you navigate a U.S.-Canada-Mexico business given today’s trade challenges?

It has never been more important to ensure that you have several contingency plans in place and to build a diversified footprint. With Signify being a global company, Genlyte has the benefit of using this reach to our advantage.

These steps have enabled us to adapt to the changing trade environment and mitigate short-term impacts as much as possible. We have, and continue to, assess developments as they unfold, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers and staying in close communication with them.

What’s next for Genlyte?

Lighting is an industry in the fast lane. It’s going through several different waves of transformation concurrently, which is exciting for our business.

The first is the shift to LED. While virtually every new construction project incorporates LED lighting and controls, there is still a big opportunity to upgrade existing buildings to high-performance technologies. Genlyte continues to bring new, ultra-efficient LED products to the market, to help our customers realize greater energy savings and quicker ROI.

Connected lighting systems, complemented with tailored lighting services, is a growing business. This can enable cities and businesses to realize even greater efficiency and value, with precise control over their lighting assets and energy use and the ability to extract actionable insights—whether for driving operational efficiency or supporting the well-being and performance of citizens or building occupants.

And now we are seeing another transition, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence. It is being applied to speed up lighting design processes and support customers’ product searches and quoting, so we can efficiently manufacture and deliver their projects.

Genlyte is committed to supporting our customers, no matter what “wave” they’re at. Our strategy focuses on delivering exceptional service, making it easy for them to get the custom lighting solutions they need, when they need it. The future looks bright and connected.",https://chiefexecutive.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kevin-Poyck-1.webp,N,,2026-01-09 14:02:31.247915

One could’ve easily sold bred heifers and replaced with the 5-year-old breds, selling $160 value into the market and getting paid $1,100 for it.","The top consultants in our industry have told me the reason my schools are the best is because I have chosen my “therapy” over everything else. What they mean is there is enough demand for me to do a school every month somewhere, but I have chosen to stay home to raise cattle and execute sell/buy trades earning money the same way I have for nearly 30 years. I enjoy the day-to-day tasks and going to auctions, which is now a welcome break from everything else in my life, which is why they now call it therapy.

I wasn’t in a good head space yesterday and must have felt I needed more time in my session. Despite the wind and the rain, I sat on the fence at the sale barn I was at and watched the sale barn cowboys load out trucks. Two things came to me.

I realized no one can criticize anything I do there. Sure, some will try, and quickly get put in their place. Thing is they have no clue what my numbers are telling me. Some have tried to lay claim to my success. They have no right since they didn’t have any skin in anything I’ve done. I also have no one to blame but myself. My only restraint is my numbers, and that is only because I am committed to making prosperous trades.

Some people don’t like auctions referring to it as a snake pit. My previous paragraph almost makes it sound like a safe space. Self-reflection is becoming a big thing for me. I’ve learned how things work and my perception is different.

My second thought was I should be used to being copied and maybe I should be flattered. Truth is it still makes me cringe, because no one respects a coat tail rider. If some in ag media, or even the education space, were sitting where I was on that fence in the rain with manure on their boots, they might be able to come up with their own original material, instead of relying on me.

Livestock haulers essential despite media calls for restrictions

Some in ag media have shared with me they think livestock haulers should have more restrictions and requirements. I will not hesitate to snap back at them they have no clue what they just said because it would crash our whole system.

I’ll save my rant, but here’s where I am going with this. If these people got their wish bull haulers would quit. Then what? Markets wouldn’t exist if we didn’t have a way to quickly transport the stock.

I think it makes sense that we need to support these people who haul livestock, instead of making things more difficult for them. The size and location of the operation doesn’t matter for this subject. At some point after the animal is sold it will take the ten-lug ride. Commerce in this industry has always been dependent on wheels. It used to be steel wheels under trains, now its 22 tires.

Weight gain business signals clear through feeder auction results

Feeder auctions sent the crystal-clear signal this is a weight gain business. Early in the week there was a leapfrog between five and six weight steers, but later in the week that got covered up.

This week feeder bulls were up to 70 back, and unweaned calves were up to 20 back. Replacement quality heifers caught a 20-dollar premium, and load lots caught one of 10 in places.

Geographical spreads were huge this week. Comparing certain weights against each other it could easily double the return on the gain, compared to buying close to home. Good thing the bull haulers don’t have all those restrictions to make this trade possible and keep the market afloat in those other states.

Cattle quality determines market success over breeder preferences

The last couple weeks I have witnessed people get upset their cattle didn’t sell well. We must sell something other people want to buy for it to sell well. A couple weeks ago I was the co bidder on some black hided, smooth headed steers that came out of a bucking stock program. These sold right at the top of the market. Time and time again, clubbie influenced cattle struggle to reach half the price the plain cattle sell for, with some not even getting a bid and being passed out as no value. If we are going to throw a fit about this on sale day remember that when ordering the straws this spring.

Breeding stock is the same way. No one wants thin cows, or small heifers. Some buyers will flat ignore certain consignments because of what they are bred to. What breed the female is will also matter to some buyers.

Female cattle depreciation patterns contradict popular industry advice

The female sale I kept tabs on looked like this. Bred heifers were the bellringers of bred stock. There was a $600 price drop for 3-4-year-olds. Then another price drop of $500 for 5-7-year-olds. Then any cow older than that was only $100 back from 5-7’s. Look where the depreciation actually happened.

The only pairs in the offering were in that 5-7-year-old range. They were over-valued to bred cows of the same age, and if the cow was bred back the 3 in 1 was worth $450 more.

Real market experience beats theoretical education and podcasting

We hear noise about deflecting depreciation and capturing appreciation. Again, these people should’ve been sitting where I was. The only two trades that work against open heifers were to sell the pairs, or bred heifers, and replace with opens.

One could’ve easily sold bred heifers and replaced with the 5-year-old breds, selling $160 value into the market and getting paid $1,100 for it. This is a better trade than swapping out for open heifers, especially since there was $1,500 value capture for having the calf at side, which gives us time value of money as well!

The previous paragraph just told readers about another great trade, 5-7-year-old pairs to breds of the same age. This sells $400 value into the market while getting paid almost $1,500 for it.

Isn’t that something, the cow the educators and podcasters tell us to sell was the best buy.

The view from the seats and drover’s alley is different and offers clarity. Now the joke is these sessions do not require insurance and are free, until we buy something.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt2e0568960277f8ae/69610c3c26eb620516aab1a0/Doug_Fergusonbeef_column.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-09 10:01:35.863535

Also, be sure to check out our list of the best CES tech we saw this year at the show.

Dreame Cyber X robot vacuum

Robot vacuums can be a little unsettling already, but Dreame’s Cyber X takes it up a level by sprouting chunky treaded “legs” and hauling itself up a full staircase like a tiny cleaning tank. In person, it navigated both up and down with surprising confidence, using its treads horizontally rather than actually stepping. The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.

OlloBot

CES loves a companion robot, but OlloBot might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.

ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo

Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect. The Zephyrus Duo uses a detachable keyboard and a built-in kickstand so you can stack screens, spread out, or generally arrange your portable battle station however you like. It’s hefty, it’s ambitious and it almost certainly won’t be cheap — but if you’ve ever wanted your gaming rig to moonlight as a two-screen creator setup, this is the loudest possible way to do it.

Throne toilet computer

Throne is a toilet-mounted computer that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.

Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual pad

Vivoo looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized. Alongside its clip-on smart toilet that analyzes your hydration by literally monitoring your pee, the company also unveiled a menstrual pad infused with microfluidics that can track fertility and hormone markers once you scan it with your phone. It’s a bold reminder that CES 2026 is fully committed to quantifying everything — even the stuff we’d rather not discuss over brunch.

Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable

Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable is what happens when a gaming laptop decides it wants to be a widescreen monitor mid-match. Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.

Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable

If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the ThinkBook XD Rollable is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.

OhDoki Handy 2 Pro

OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.

iPolish

iPolish finally made Total Recall nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger. These press-on acrylic nails use an electric charge to switch between hundreds of colors in seconds, letting you change your manicure as often as your outfit. It’s delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable and the most convincing argument yet for treating your nails like a customizable display.

Hisense S6 FollowMe display

Despite the name, Hisense’s FollowMe doesn’t actually follow you at all. It’s a 32-inch 4K smart display on wheels that you manually drag from room to room, delivering strong TV-and-VCR-on-a-cart energy, just with Wi-Fi 6, a built-in camera, far-field mics and a 10-hour battery. It won’t judge you, chase you or demand attention, which might make it one of the least emotionally exhausting smart displays at CES.

GE Profile Smart Fridge

If you’ve ever bought a “just in case” bag of spinach and discovered three more at home, GE’s latest smart fridge wants to be your grocery reality check. A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required. The AI bits are mostly there to answer practical questions like “Where’s my water filter?” which is the most convincing argument we’ve heard for putting a voice assistant on a fridge.

The Big Question What is your go-to escapist car film/book/tv show?","The confluence of politics and cars has been a little exhausting lately. Honestly, the confluence of politics with everything is overwhelming what few circuitbreakers I have left in my psyche. That’s why I’m glad that, today of all days, the car news is a little slow and boring, so I can provide a little bit of good news.

A new Jackass movie is coming this summer! Johnny Knoxville, Wee Man, and… other people, I’m sure, will be back. It’s been far too long, and while I don’t think it’ll mend all of America’s tears, maybe it’ll distract us long enough to remember we’re all part of the same fabric. And also, it’s fun to watch people do dumb things with cars.

Because CES is going on, there’s still a lot of talk about self-driving, and Ford’s made a kind of surprising announcement. Lucid and Uber made an announcement, but I’m less surprised by it, as it seems obvious.

And, finally, Volvo has a car that plans to fight range anxiety.

Who Is Ready For Jackass This Summer?

A post shared by Johnny Knoxville (@johnnyknoxville)

We did three film festivals at Jalopnik, and the last one was the biggest and also my least favorite. It got too big because we got more than a million dollars for it, and the more money you take, the more you gotta do. It had some great moments, including showing the documentary about car culture in Cuba, Havana Motor Club (a couple of participants in the film were on hand and may have done some hilarious thing with a reader’s AMG wagon…).

In retrospect, the film order was all wrong. We started the day with Mad Max and then transitioned into Being Evel, the Johnny Knoxville-helmed doc about Evel Knievel, finishing with our big “get,” which was the North American premiere of Steve McQueen: The Man & Le Mans. This was a doc about the making of the Le Mans film and, like the film it’s based on, it was good, not great.

I hadn’t even seen Being Evel; it was just available, so we tossed it in the lineup. My bad! It’s fantastic. As someone who has made a couple of documentaries since, I’m overwhelmed by the thoughtfulness. The McQueen documentary has a hard time resolving the fact that its subject was a deeply flawed person, clearly fearful that it would make the project itself not worth making if it fully acknowledged McQueen’s behavior. Hagiography is a bit like gastroenterology in that they’re both primarily consumed with making difficult shit disappear.

Being Evel directly confronts the person of Evel Knievel and doesn’t pull any punches, which somehow doesn’t make you care less about his accomplishments.

This is all to say that I think if you look with any scrutiny at Johnny Knoxville’s body of work, the most consistent feature is a remarkable consciousness. A large percentage of his oeuvre is dedicated to people getting hit in the nuts or turning their pink torpedoes into beehives or whatever, but none of it feels like punching down. That seems impossible.

The last Jackass project was in 2022, with the film Jackass Forever. Not everyone from the original MTV prank show was there for reasons both tragic and litigious, but it felt like it came at exactly the right time. According to a new post from Johnny Knoxville, a new Jackass film is coming this summer.

Given everything else in the world, I think a few of us might need this. Watching someone fired like a projectile out of a piece of artillery or slammed in the nards with a pumelo isn’t going to fix everything, or anything, but I welcome the distraction.

Just leave the poor Ford Contours alone!

Ford Thinks It’s Going To Catch Up To GM’s Eye-Free Driving With Its Cheapest EV

Ok, this one got me. In the self-driving space, we’ve been sort of stuck at Level 2, so people keep inventing their own SAE labels like “Level 2++” or FSD. Essentially, no one is willing to commit to Level 3 because, seemingly, the handoff between driver and passenger feels harder at 75 mph if the driver is, say, asleep.

Mercedes announced its FSD-like Level 2 system this week, and GM has said it’ll bring “eyes-off driving” to the super expensive Cadillac Escalade IQ for highways in 2028. Ford said it’ll match its crosstown rival with Level 2 in 2027 on its cheapest vehicle and then L3 in 2028.

Doug Field, the company’s head of all things technological and EV, said this:

Autonomy shouldn’t be a premium feature. By designing our own software and hardware in-house, we’ve found a way to make this technology more affordable. This means we can put advanced hands-free driving into the vehicles people actually buy, not just vehicles with unattainable price points. With 1.2 million BlueCruise-equipped vehicles already on the road, we are able to learn from real-world miles to continuously improve the experience for our customers.

Just as important, we’re focused on efficiency — delivering more capability, not just sheer processing power. Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable.

We plan to introduce new hardware and software, thanks to our in-house teams, starting in 2027 on our all-new, affordable Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform. And we aren’t stopping at hands-free driving; building on this same flexible foundation, L3 eyes-off driving will be road ready in 2028, making the ultimate in-vehicle experience available for the many, not just a privileged few

It sounds like, then, Ford and GM will debut systems at roughly the same time, but the difference is that it’ll be on Ford’s Skunkworks truck or other cheap EV, and for GM, it’ll start out on the Escalade IQ.

Uber And Lucid Are Doing A Thing

It’s been clear for a long time that Uber’s long-term goal is to get rid of drivers, although the path to this has been rocky. Uber initially partnered with Volvo on a self driving program that resulted in the first self-driving fatality.

Uber is trying again in the United States, this time with a robotaxi based on the Lucid Gravity. That car is arguably the best three-row anything for sale right now, so that’s not a bad place to start. How big the market is for three-row EVs remains to be seen, but this seems like a good use of the company’s growing production capacity.

The company says the taxis are already testing in San Francisco, and a production-intent version will go into production later this year, featuring tech from Nuro.

From Lucid:

“The debut of our production intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale,” said Dave Ferguson, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Nuro. “By bringing together Nuro’s proven level 4 autonomy, Lucid’s advanced vehicle architecture, and Uber’s global reach, we’re building a robotaxi service designed for real-world operations and long-term growth.”

“Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Global Head of Autonomous Mobility & Delivery at Uber. “By combining leading expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we’re building a unique new option for affordable and scalable autonomous rides in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.”

As with Waymo, but unlike Tesla, this system uses Lidar.

The Volvo EX60 Gets 400 Miles Of Range

A new Volvo compact crossover EV is coming in the form of the Volvo EX60. The company is very excited about the 400 miles of range and charging time:

“The EX60 is designed to be a gamechanger,” says Anders Bell, Chief Technology Officer at Volvo Cars. “With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety.”

The EX60 does not only boast the longest range of any fully electric Volvo, it also charges faster than any electric Volvo before in all weather conditions. Instead of a full lunch break, a quick coffee stop is now enough to recharge the battery and hit the road again.

Fun fact, when someone says something is going to be a “gamechanger” it is not going to change any games. It used to be that 300 miles was the gold standard of EVs, but for luxury EVs, I think it’s probably been surpassed. 400 is the new 300, you heard it here first.

Multiple analysts have raised their price targets on shares this week as Delta (DAL) kicks off earnings for airline stocks early next week.

Southwest Stock Southwest shares surged 4.4% Friday to break out above a 43.54 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern.
Delta stock gained 1.6% Friday.","Southwest Airlines broke out early Friday after receiving a double upgrade from JPMorgan. Multiple analysts have raised their price targets on shares this week as Delta (DAL) kicks off earnings for airline stocks early next week. Other airline stocks rose early Friday.

JPMorgan on Friday upgraded Southwest Airlines (LUV) to overweight from underweight and hiked its price target on LUV stock to 60 from 36, The Fly reported. The firm said that the potential for a $5 earnings-per-share outlook for 2026 is ""attractively probable,"" and such a guidance would ""handily dwarf"" the $2.98 consensus estimate. It added that Southwest's core business was starting to stabilize and its initiatives, such as bag fees and seat assignments, are progressing.

Southwest reports its results on Jan. 29. FactSet expects Southwest to report a 1 cent increase in earnings to 57 cents per share on 5% decline in revenue.

The double upgrade comes after Morgan Stanley on Thursday raised its price target on Southwest from 48 to 50. The report noted that airlines have sounded very positive about underlying demand trends. However, Q4 will likely be ""another noisy quarter"" to cap off a ""write-off year"" for airlines. Still, the ""tone may be different"" despite the noise. The firm kept an overweight rating on LUV stock.

UBS on Tuesday said that the setup heading into earnings season appears favorable. The firm expects bullish outlooks for Q1 and 2026, driven by rebounding demand, modest Q1 capacity growth, easing fuel prices and easier demand comparisons starting in February.

UBS raised its price target on LUV stock to 45 from 43 and kept a neutral rating on the shares.

Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines reports Q4 results on Tuesday. FactSet analysts expect earnings will fall 17% to $1.53 per share on 4% revenue growth to $14.7 billion.

Delta in its Q3 report said it expects earnings to range from $1.60 to $1.90 per share on 2% to 4% revenue growth. CEO Ed Bastian in October said that Q4 could potentially be ""the best fourth-quarter performance in our history.""

Southwest Stock

Southwest shares surged 4.4% Friday to break out above a 43.54 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern.

The four-weeks-tight pattern, a follow-on buying opportunity, took shape after Southwest broke out of a six-month cup base in early December.

Southwest stock is trading near its highest price since June 2022.

American Airlines (AAL) swung 3.5% higher Friday morning. United Airlines (UAL) rose more than 2% to advance out of a buy zone.

Delta stock gained 1.6% Friday.

At CES 2026, HP Inc. is highlighting its growing problems, which are being faced by professionals worldwide: workplace stress and low job satisfaction. As per HP’s research, only 20 per cent of knowledge workers currently have a healthy relationship with work. The company believes this can change with the right mix of AI-driven tools, flexible devices and employee-first technology. When companies invest in modern technology, employee satisfaction and productivity rise significantly — a message that strongly resonates with India’s rapidly growing hybrid workforce.

HP has rolled out a bunch of new devices and platforms aimed at making hybrid work, creativity, and business growth a little easier.

1. HP EliteBoard G1a

Let’s start with the HP EliteBoard G1a. It’s the first full AI PC hidden right inside a keyboard. You just pick it up, drop it into any workspace, and you’ve got serious computing power in something that barely takes up space. The thing even snagged a CES 2026 Innovation Award.

2. HP EliteBook X G2 Series

These are high-end business laptops built for the age of AI. They’re made for folks who want performance, tight security, and smart features all in one slim package.

3. OmniBook Ultra 14 and OmniStudioX

On the consumer side, HP gave its OmniBook lineup a refresh. The new OmniBook Ultra 14 and OmniStudioX promise faster speeds, sharper video, and smarter AI tools—great for everyday users and creators who want something extra.

4. HP Printer with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Printing gets a big upgrade, too. HP became the first to bake Microsoft Copilot right into its office printers. With HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can summarise documents, translate, and organise files straight from the printer. That’s a real time-saver, especially for busy offices and small businesses in India.

5. Workforce Experience Platform (WXP)

For IT teams, HP improved its Workforce Experience Platform (WXP). Managing devices, keeping business running smoothly, and supporting remote work just got a lot simpler.

6. HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M

HP also introduced some new accessories, all designed with comfort and sustainability in mind. Think: the HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M (now in pink for a little flair), a compact 65W USB-C GaN charger, and protective laptop sleeves built to last.

7. OMEN and HyperX

Gamers, you’re not left out. OMEN and HyperX are now unified under the HyperX brand, and there’s the new HyperX OMEN MAX 16. HP calls it the world’s most powerful gaming laptop, complete with all-internal cooling.

8. HP Digital Passport

Another highlight is the HP Digital Passport. This platform, which also won a CES 2026 Innovation Award, gives you everything you need to know about your device—from features and sustainability details to support—all in one spot.

9. HP’s Future of Work Accelerator

And one thing to look ahead to is the HP Future of Work Accelerator, which is going to take place in 2026. It will offer funding, hardware and mentorship to organisations working in AI and workforce development.

Pour UBS, les ""étoiles s'alignent' pour L'Oréal, quand JPMorgan a intégré l'action dans sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"".

L'Oréal bondit à la Bourse de Paris vendredi, à la faveur d'un relèvement de recommandation par UBS, qui identifie une combinaison rare de facteurs bénéficiant au géant français des cosmétiques, tandis que JPMorgan l'a inscrit sur sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"" à l’approche des résultats de février.

Vers 12h, le titre gagne 4,4% à 380,30 euros tandis que son indice de référence, le CAC40 montant de 0,70% au même moment.

Dans une note publiée jeudi, UBS souligne que ""les étoiles s’alignent"" pour L’Oréal, le groupe étant porté par l’accélération du secteur et des gains de parts de marché, une valorisation jugée ""attrayante"" ainsi qu’un profil de risque amélioré.

Le courtier, qui relève sa recommandation à ""acheter"" contre ""neutre"", anticipe désormais une croissance organique de 6,4% au quatrième trimestre 2025, contre un consensus à 6,1%, et de 5,8% en 2026.

""Nous nous attendons à ce que L’Oréal indique une nouvelle année de surperformance par rapport à l’industrie de la beauté et de progrès supplémentaires en matière de rentabilité"", ajoute UBS.

""Positive Catalyst Watch""

En parallèle, JPMorgan a placé le groupe sur sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"".

Selon le courtier, les commentaires optimistes sur l’amélioration aux États-Unis et la reprise progressive en Chine donnés en décembre lors d'une journée des investisseurs, ainsi que les données récentes, devraient rassurer sur l’accélération de la ?croissance organique sous-jacente des ventes.

""La dynamique du chiffre d’affaires à court terme devrait être rassurante, avec un bon point de sortie vers 2025 et une poursuite probable de la dynamique au premier ?trimestre, ce qui pourrait renforcer la confiance pour 2026"", ajoute-t-il.

JPMorgan indique toutefois s’attendre à une croissance organique limitée à 4,4% en 2026, en dessous du consensus (+5%), en raison du ralentissement en Europe occidentale et d’une accélération séquentielle limitée en Chine.

Une ""surprise positive"" à court terme serait bien accueillie par le marché, souligne le courtier, mais une revalorisation durable du titre nécessiterait une surperformance plus marquée, ajoute-t-il cependant.

Zacks Investment Research does not engage in investment banking, market making or asset management activities of any securities.","Our estimates for Mounjaro and Zepbound suggest a CAGR of 44.6% and 73.7%, respectively, over the next three years. Meanwhile, in addition to Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly is investing broadly in obesity and has several new molecules currently in clinical development with a range of oral and injectable medications with different mechanisms of action.

Lilly Inks Obesity Drug Deal with Trump Administration

LLY has inked a deal with the Trump Administration to provide wider access to obesity drugs through the ""TrumpRX"" platform. The new ""BALANCE"" program will allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1s for obesity with lower co-pays ($50/month) starting in 2027. These incentives should help to drive hot obesity drug sales even further.

New Drugs, Future Pipeline will Continue to Drive Growth

In addition to Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly has received approvals for other new drugs in the past couple of years. Omvoh/mirikizumab was approved for its first inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indication, ulcerative colitis, in the United States, Europe and Japan in 2023 and for its second IBD condition, Crohn's disease, in the United States, Europe, and Japan in 2025. Additionally, Lilly has been building its pipeline and has a wide range of compounds in various stages of development.

Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates expect robust EPS growth of 41.24% in 2026. LLY, which recently crossed the $1 trillion market cap landmark, will continue to attract institutional investors, as the company has the rare and coveted combination of rapid growth and underlying liquidity.

LLY Bounces off the Rising 10-Week MA

Beyond fundamentals, LLY's price action is also bullish. LLY shares are bouncing off the rising 10-week moving average for the first time since breaking out in late 2025, offering investors a high reward-to-risk entry point.

Bottom Line

Eli Lilly has solidified its position as a global pharma titan. With leading drugs and a massive obesity market, Lilly is poised to be a juggernaut for years to come.

Bear of the Day:

Based in Beijing, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock JD.com one of the largest Chinese e-commerce and technology companies. Also known as Jingdong, JD.com separates itself from the competition by being an essentially vertically integrated e-commerce retailer. JD holds its own inventory, is responsible for its own logistics and deliveries, and provides its own customer service.

JD is similar to Amazon in that it sells a wide variety of products on its e-commerce platform, including clothing, groceries, electronics, and more. Beyond e-commerce, JD also operates health, technology, real estate, and industrial segment businesses. Additionally, JD owns Ochama, a European-based retail brand with operations in the Netherlands France, and Poland.

JD Suffers from Relative Price Weakness Vs. Peers

Legendary growth investor William O'Neil once proclaimed that Wall Street's great paradox is, ""Stocks that seem too high in price and risky for most investors usually go higher and stocks that seem low and cheap often go lower."" I have largely discovered that more often than not, O'Neil's paradox comes to fruition. That's bad news for JD shares, which trade at $30 and are well off their all-time high of >$100.

Additionally, relative price action can provide investors with valuable clues. Currently, JD shares exhibit troubling relative weakness and are -15.02% over the past year, far underperforming top competitors like Pinduoduo and Alibabawhich are up 20.76% and 83.76% respectively.

JD: Slowing Sales Growth

JD sales growth is declining at an alarming rate. For the current quarter, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates suggest that earnings growth will be just 6.68%%. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest sluggish annual revenue growth of 5.22% in 2026.

JD Food Delivery Business is a Headwind

JD is making an aggressive play for the Chinese food delivery market. While the number of users for the company's Uber (UBER) Eats or DoorDash (DASH) like business has increased, the segment has produced significant losses thus far. Worse still, the company must invest significant capital to maintain its reputation for fast and reliable delivery in a highly competitive market.

Bottom Line

JD.com currently faces a difficult uphill battle. Between alarming slowdowns in growth and the financial strain of expansion into the competitive food delivery market, JD's ""cheap"" share price may be warranted.

Is BigBear.ai a NVIDIA-like AI Stock and Top 2026 Buy?

BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. has strengthened its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings and growth potential through a recent strategic acquisition and a robust cash position. However, a slowdown in revenue growth and rising losses raise questions about whether the stock is a buy now and whether it's too early to call it the next NVIDIA Corporation. Let's take a closer look.

Reasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai

BigBear.ai's recent $250 million acquisition of Ask Sage is expected to drive revenue growth by strengthening its footprint in national security, defense and intelligence markets. Ask Sage is a rapidly growing generative AI platform tailored for the defense industry and used by agencies, including Defense Health and the U.S. Space Force.

BigBear.ai's Ask Sage integration has added a secure generative AI workflow to its portfolio, enabling customers to deploy AI while preserving data sovereignty and security. Kevin McAleenan, CEO of BigBear.ai, added that ""Ask Sage is already operating at scale in mission-critical environments, and together we are bringing to market a secure, integrated AI platform that unifies data, software, and mission services in one place,"" as noted in the company's news release.

BigBear.ai's management is optimistic about future sales growth and has already raised full-year 2025 revenue guidance to between $125 million and $140 million, citing ir.bigbear.ai. Additionally, BigBear.ai's solid cash balance of $456.6 million as of Sept. 30, 2025, has provided the company with ample funds to support growth initiatives.

Is BBAI the Next NVIDIA-Like AI Stock & a Top Buy for 2026?

The Ask Sage acquisition, strong cash position and potential boost in government spending from President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" could accelerate BigBear.ai's revenue growth. The company is also moving closer to profitability. It reported third-quarter 2025 net income of $2.5 million, in contrast to the net loss of $15.1 million a year ago, which may encourage stakeholders to hold onto the stock.

However, even if it's anticipated that BigBear.ai will experience an acceleration in revenue growth, its results show a deceleration. BigBear.ai's third-quarter 2025 revenues of $33.1 million fell 20% year over year, following second-quarter 2025 revenues of $32.5 million, which declined 18% year over year. Moreover, the company posted a third-quarter operating loss of $21.9 million, more than double the previous year's figure.

All these factors suggest that it may not be the ideal time for new entrants to place bets on BigBear.ai. Declining sales growth and rising operating losses could hinder the company's growth momentum, making it premature to label BigBear.ai as the ""next NVIDIA"" in the field of AI.

The Jensen Huang-led company, on the other hand, has been reporting consistent increases in quarterly revenues and earnings, banking on the incessant demand for their next-generation Blackwell chips and CUDA software platform (read more: Top 3 AI Stocks, Including NVIDIA to Buy Now for 2026 Growth).

Currently, BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.

The rollout of OpenAI for Healthcare makes it clear the company is betting that health is going to be a big vertical. OpenAI is looking to make ChatGPT a key tool on both sides of the healthcare equation. Anthropic has also launched Claude for Life Sciences and has embedded its models into healthcare workflows. Both model providers will compete and partner with healthcare efforts from multiple software and cloud vendors.

ChatGPT for Healthcare is rolling out with some major customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said AdventHealth, Baylor Scott & White Health, Boston Children’s Hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, HCA Healthcare, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford Medicine Children’s Health and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) will use ChatGPT for Healthcare.

OpenAI said healthcare providers have been tailoring OpenAI API to be HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT for Healthcare can help with serving up medical knowledge, admin work and personalize care. OpenAI provided sample prompts and use cases for ChatGPT for Healthcare.

ChatGPT for Healthcare includes:

GPT-5 models specifically built for healthcare and tested by physicians and benchmarked.

Citations for evidence retrieval to check sources.

Integrations with enterprise tools so healthcare providers align ChatGPT for Healthcare with policies, document repositories and best practices.

Templates for workflow automation for patient instructions, discharge summaries, clinical letters and authorizations.

Governance and access management based on roles.

HIPAA compliance. Content shared with ChatGPT for Healthcare isn't used to train models.

ChatGPT for Healthcare appears to have a better footing in the enterprise with big name customers already in the fold. It remains to be seen how ChatGPT Health fares with consumers.

Launched earlier this week to a small number of customers, ChatGPT Health is a dedicated experience where consumers can share medical records, data and wellness information. ChatGPT Health promises to keep conversations encrypted and isolated.

ChatGPT Health also integrates with Apple Health, Function and MyFitnessPal and will likely expand its roster of health apps in the future. OpenAI said that ChatGPT Health conversations won't flow over to regular chats. Ultimately, OpenAI sees ChatGPT Health as an advisor to prep consumers for doctor visits, improve nutrition and craft exercise programs. The service will even digest your lab results and point out what's important.

What could go wrong? Given that health is a primary use case for ChatGPT already, I didn't expect much wariness from health savvy consumers in my circle. Instead, the answers were unanimous with some form of ""hell no."" Biggest concern was sharing your data with OpenAI. Now this informal poll isn't scientific, but there will be some set of consumers that won't trust OpenAI's dedicated health service without some HIPAA-like promise.

Either way, ChatGPT for Healthcare may take care of patient usage. It'll just be a question of whether patients use OpenAI directly or indirectly.",https://www.constellationr.com/sites/default/files/styles/metatag/public/uploads/Screenshot%202026-01-09%20063242.png?itok=DLTJ05Da,N,,2026-01-09 08:01:56.950858

Significant Technical Reversal for L'Oréal

L'Oréal's stock marked an increase of 4.64% to 379.75 euros this Friday, January 9 at midday, up from a closing at 362.90 euros the previous day. This rise represents a significant technical reversal for the French cosmetics giant, as it now surpasses its key resistance level of 377.95 euros identified in previous days. The 50-day moving average, set at 365.21 euros, is also exceeded upwards, signaling a potential short-term trend change after several weeks of consolidation. This rebound occurs after Swiss bank UBS upgraded its recommendation from neutral to buy this morning, simultaneously raising its price target from 367 to 430 euros. UBS justifies this change by a significant improvement in the group's performance indicators, strengthened commercial dynamics in the United States and China, and reduced risks related to capital allocation. The bank anticipates a comparable sales growth of 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and 5.8% in 2026, above the consensus established at 6.1% and 5.1% respectively. JPMorgan has also added the stock to its list of securities offering the best short-term yield-risk ratio.

Technical Indicators and Valuation

The RSI, standing at 39, confirms that the stock had been moving in a technically neutral zone without signs of overbuying, leaving room for progression. The MACD trend indicator, although slightly negative with a MACD line at minus 0.68 point below the signal line at 0.63 point, does not prevent this vigorous rebound supported by a major fundamental catalyst. The moderate monthly volatility of 5.22% and an almost zero beta at 0.10 demonstrate a relatively decoupled evolution from the movements of the CAC 40, which enhances the interest in this independent movement of the stock. UBS highlights that the stock's valuation has become attractive again, with a ratio of 26.5 times the estimated earnings for 2026, a level 20% below its five-year average. The brokerage also praises the strategic decision of the group to limit its stake in Galderma to 20%, ending uncertainties over future capital allocation. Bernstein has also slightly lowered its price target from 410 to 405 euros while maintaining its market performance recommendation. The group will publish its annual 2025 results on February 12, a date that will focus investor attention following this bond issue of 1.75 billion euros carried out on January 7 to partly finance the acquisition of an additional 10% stake in Galderma.

Best Buy Investment Narrative Recap

To own Best Buy, you need to believe the company can offset pressures in lower margin electronics with healthier earnings from services, memberships and vendor support. The recent news about disciplined holiday promotions and a tilt toward higher margin offerings supports that thesis and may help the key short term catalyst of margin stability, but it does not remove the core risk that mix shifts, promotions and competition could still pressure gross profit.

Among recent announcements, the continued commitment to a US$0.95 quarterly dividend stands out in this context, because it highlights management’s focus on returning cash to shareholders while working through softer earnings and margin compression. For investors, this sits alongside the push into higher margin services as a key part of how Best Buy is trying to balance current profitability with future reinvestment, even as online competition and direct to consumer brands test the resilience of its store centric model.

Yet behind this push into services, investors should still be aware of the risk that heavier exposure to lower margin categories and intense promotions could...

Best Buy's narrative projects $44.5 billion revenue and $1.5 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 2.3% yearly revenue growth and roughly a $700 million earnings increase from $778.0 million today.

Uncover how Best Buy's forecasts yield a $83.57 fair value, a 21% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Six fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$65 to US$147 per share, showing how far apart individual views can be. Against this spread, the focus on higher margin services as a potential earnings support invites you to weigh how such initiatives might influence Best Buy’s ability to handle pricing pressure and online competition over time.

The new 8m x 4.5m walls feature a 6.67mm pixel pitch and 10,000 nits of brightness – the company says this represents five times the resolution and double the brightness of the previous 16mm pixel pitch, 5,000-nit screens that had been in place for 12 years.

The Philips Urban LED 6000 Series walls carry an IP65 rating, designed to be resistant to water and airborne pollutants, with operational performance in temperatures ranging from -20°C to 50°C. Each wall operates with a power consumption of 18kW, compared to the original walls’ 23kW consumption.

Local AV specialist and PPDS partner Mansveld Techniek completed the installation in three weeks, ahead of the start of the 2025/26 Eredivisie season. The project requirements included high-quality performance, reliability, flexibility for various hosted events beyond football, and sustainability.

Sjors van den Boogaart, director of Philips Stadion, said: “After more than a decade of service, our displays have made way for the new LED walls in the Philips Stadion, delivering a huge leap in image quality and brightness, which perfectly aligns with our ambitions for innovation. Fans now experience sharper visuals, whilst installations continue to support dynamic and impactful content.”

Koen Vroomen, sales manager Benelux at PPDS, added: “Continuing PPDS’ enviable association and affiliation in designing and providing tailored dvLED solutions to some of the world’s leading professional teams – with FC Barcelona, Oracle Red Bull Racing and Harlequins RFC among those made public – we were delighted to be part of this exciting project.”

At Afresh, Litle will lead go-to-market strategy as the company expands how grocery teams use AI to plan, buy, and operate fresh food categories every day.
That same intelligence now supports a broader set of fresh food decisions, giving grocery teams a shared view of what is happening today and what needs to happen next.","Food technology executive joins Afresh, following record 70% growth, to expand its AI platform across merchandising, operations, and supply chain organizations.

SAN FRANCISCO — Afresh announced the appointment of Adam Litle as Chief Revenue Officer, following the company’s biggest year to date, with more than 70% year-over-year topline growth and usage across more than 12,000 grocery departments in North America. The hire reflects Afresh’s focus on accelerating adoption of its AI platform across the grocery industry. Litle joins a leadership team with deep experience operating enterprise software companies through periods of rapid growth.

Over the past year, Afresh has expanded its platform with several of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., including Albertsons, Wakefern, and Meijer. As adoption has grown, more merchandising, operations, and supply chain teams are relying on Afresh’s platform to run fresh food categories. With the launch of several new products in 2025—including Production Planning, Period Ending Inventory, Fresh Buying, and a major upgrade to its flagship Fresh Replenishment solution—the company is scaling to support continued growth across both U.S. and international markets.

Litle brings deep experience building and scaling technology companies in food, agriculture, and retail. He most recently served as CEO of Sound Agriculture and previously held the role of Chief Revenue Officer at Granular, where he helped grow the company from inception through its acquisition by Corteva—the second-largest agtech exit at the time. Earlier in his career, Litle led sales at Monetate, where he launched AI-driven personalization solutions for retail e-commerce, working closely with merchandising and digital teams. At Afresh, Litle will lead go-to-market strategy as the company expands how grocery teams use AI to plan, buy, and operate fresh food categories every day.

“What stood out to me about Afresh wasn’t just its leadership in fresh—it was the potential for it to expand its AI platform to all aspects of the food supply chain,” said Litle. “The company was built to tackle the staggering reality that 30-40% of global food production is wasted. Afresh applies cutting-edge AI to manage thousands of variables that impact buying, ordering, and inventory decisions for produce, meat, seafood, deli, and baked goods. The opportunity for Afresh’s technology to help optimize decisions across grocery and food distribution, all the way back to the farm, is massive.”

From the beginning, Afresh has focused on solving the operational complexity of fresh food at scale. The company first demonstrated this approach in fresh replenishment, where accurate ordering requires accounting for daily shifts in demand and supply. That same intelligence now supports a broader set of fresh food decisions, giving grocery teams a shared view of what is happening today and what needs to happen next.

“Afresh is at a pivotal moment as grocery teams face more volatility—and pressure to get decisions right—than ever before,” said Matt Schwartz, CEO and co-founder of Afresh. “Adam has spent his career helping food and agtech companies turn complex technology into real customer value. His experience scaling organizations in dynamic environments will be critical as we build on our momentum and expand Afresh’s impact across the industry.”",https://perishablenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B_Afresh.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 16:01:45.410939

Dior’s next retail opening in Asia centers on landscape as much as fashion. When the Dior Bamboo Pavilion opens on February 12 in Tokyo’s Daikanyama district, the House will introduce a temporary structure shaped by vegetation, architectural craft, and long-standing cultural ties between France and Japan. The Pavilion continues Dior’s recent series of experiential retail projects in cities including Bangkok and Seoul, while placing an unusually strong emphasis on gardens and plant life as organizing principles.

The exterior draws on Dior’s historic flagship at 30 Avenue Montaigne, incorporating recognizable house motifs such as the star Christian Dior regarded as his good luck charm. In Tokyo, those references take the form of a golden, bamboo-inspired facade, aligning the structure with the surrounding neighborhood. Daikanyama’s residential character, marked by small shops, cafes, and independent galleries, provides a subdued setting for the Pavilion’s architectural presence.

A garden as the pavilion’s core

Vegetation shapes the Pavilion from the inside out. The indoor green space conceived by floral artist Azuma Makoto forms the spatial center of the project, spanning more than 19,000 square feet. Makoto’s work for Dior has previously translated botanical forms into sculptural installations; in Tokyo, the scale expands to create an immersive environment that moves through layered plantings and architectural framing. The installation reflects Christian Dior’s documented fascination with gardens and their influence on his approach to color, silhouette, and composition.

Additional landscape elements extend throughout the Pavilion. A Zen garden designed by landscape designer Seijun Nishihata introduces a contemplative rhythm to the space, while a terrace and a pond populated with koi carp rendered in luminous glass introduce water and light as design elements.

The emphasis on gardens aligns the Pavilion with broader developments in luxury retail design, where biophilic environments have become increasingly common. Dior’s approach distinguishes itself through scale and integration, with vegetation shaping circulation, sightlines, and the pacing of the retail experience.

Fashion, craft, and cultural continuity

Within this landscaped setting, Dior will present women’s and men’s collections designed by creative director Jonathan Anderson, including ready-to-wear, shoes, accessories, and jewelry. A dedicated room for the customization of Lady Dior and Book Tote bags introduces a focused area for bespoke interaction, consistent with the Pavilion’s attention to craftsmanship.

Interior finishes combine established Dior codes with Japanese materials and techniques. Versailles parquet flooring appears alongside ceilings and walls finished in washi paper, while lanterns modeled after the Lady Dior bag punctuate the space. The Pavilion also includes works by contemporary designers and studios such as Takt Project, Sho Ota, Ayumi Shibata, We+, Hana Mitsui, and Chikaken, reinforcing connections to Tokyo’s design community.

The Pavilion will house Café Dior, featuring an exclusive menu developed by chef Anne-Sophie Pic, extending Dior’s ongoing collaboration with the Michelin-starred chef. The opening follows the launch of the Monsieur Dior restaurant in Beijing and reflects the House’s continued expansion into hospitality as part of its broader lifestyle strategy.",https://the-ethos.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dior-garden.webp,N,,2026-01-09 10:13:23.834740

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-09 08:05:51+00:00,EE Times,Nvidia Bets Big on China with H200 Push - EE Times,"Pablo Valerio, Sunny Bains",,,,,https://www.eetimes.com/nvidia-bets-big-on-china-with-h200-push/,"This would require Chinese companies to buy a certain number of domestic chips, like Huawei’s Ascend series, with every Nvidia H200 order.
To make this work, Beijing has reportedly told tech companies to temporarily stop buying H200 chips.
Now, buyers must pay the full amount upfront for H200 orders, with no option to cancel or get a refund.
Even with these tough terms, Chinese companies are still eager to buy, underscoring their need for computing power to train large language models.
As TSMC increases production and the U.S. collects its fees, the movement of H200 chips will show where global tech separation is heading.","This week, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared confident despite the complex geopolitical challenges facing the company.

Standing before a packed crowd, Huang confirmed the substantial Chinese demand for Nvidia’s advanced H200 artificial-intelligence processors. “We’ve fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,” he said Tuesday during a Q&A session. “We’re getting the last details of the licensing finished with the U.S. government.”

Despite Huang’s confident statements, Nvidia faces a complicated set of regulations that make selling these chips unusually difficult. The company has asked TSMC to increase production, but it must deal with two major challenges: a 25% tax from the U.S. government and a policy from Beijing that pushes customers to buy from local competitors.

Frenzy in the supply chain

Nvidia is acting quickly to capitalize on what it sees as a new opportunity. People familiar with the situation say the company has officially asked TSMC to make more H200 chips to meet rising demand from Chinese tech companies.

The data shows a significant demand for computing power. Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba have reportedly placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, with deliveries scheduled for this year. This demand is well above Nvidia’s current stock of about 700,000 units, so the company plans to start additional manufacturing runs in the second quarter of 2026.

Each chip costs about $27,000 and represents a significant improvement over earlier H20 processors sold in China. But delivering these orders is not just a matter of logistics—it also depends on political stability. As Huang said on Tuesday, “The future ships on schedule; the present ships when it’s allowed to.”

Washington’s price of admission

The resumption of high-end chip sales to China follows a chaotic period of policy shifts in Washington. The Biden administration had previously instituted a broad ban on advanced AI semiconductors to thwart China’s military modernization.

In a major change, President Donald Trump recently allowed the export of the H200 to “approved customers,” but added a new rule: 25% fee on sales revenue must go to the U.S. Treasury. To sell to China, Nvidia must first ship the chips to the U.S., pay the 25% as an import tax, undergo a “security inspection,” and then send the chips to Chinese customers.

Experts say this policy marks a shift from trying to contain China to making money from sales. It has sparked heated debate within the U.S. government. Senate Democrats and some national security advocates have called the decision “dangerous,” saying the H200—about six times more powerful than the previous model—will “turbocharge” China’s military capabilities. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, seven senators warned that the administration was sacrificing national security at risk for corporate profits.

“The President’s dangerous decision to give away critical national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities,” the senators wrote.

Even with presidential approval, shipments are still slowed by bureaucracy. Each export needs its own license, which can delay or stop shipments. Nvidia executives say the final details of the licensing process are still being worked out, so shipping dates remain uncertain.

Beijing’s “matchmaking” mandate

While Washington seeks to tax Nvidia’s entry, Beijing is maneuvering to limit it. The Chinese government is treating the H200 not just as a product but as a strategic lever to force domestic self-sufficiency.

According to Reuters, regulators at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) are creating a “matchmaking” policy. This would require Chinese companies to buy a certain number of domestic chips, like Huawei’s Ascend series, with every Nvidia H200 order.

To make this work, Beijing has reportedly told tech companies to temporarily stop buying H200 chips. This pause prevents a rush to buy U.S. chips and to protect local companies’ market share. Soon, commercial buyers may also have to explain why domestic chips are not enough before they can import Nvidia products.

For the public sector, access is not allowed. Beijing plans to stop the military, state-owned companies, and key infrastructure operators from buying the H200, citing security risks and the chance that the U.S. could disable the hardware remotely.

Nvidia’s strict payment conditions

Stuck between two unpredictable governments, Nvidia has protected itself by setting strict payment rules for Chinese customers. Now, buyers must pay the full amount upfront for H200 orders, with no option to cancel or get a refund.

This cash-before-delivery approach puts all the financial risk on Chinese buyers if regulations change. Nvidia is being careful because, in 2025, it had to write off $5.5 billion in inventory after new U.S. export rules made its China-only H20 chip unsellable overnight.

“Nvidia has been burned in the past,” said a source familiar with the company. The payment structure ensures that if the political winds shift again, Nvidia isn’t left holding the bag. Even with these tough terms, Chinese companies are still eager to buy, underscoring their need for computing power to train large language models.

Geopolitical tug-of-war

The struggle over the H200 highlights a fundamental bifurcation in the global technology stack. While the U.S. attempts to maintain leverage through export controls and tariffs, China is accelerating its “Silicon Sovereignty” campaign.

U.S. bans have actually helped drive Chinese innovation. Local chipmakers like Huawei and Baidu are moving from backup roles to becoming “core pillars” of China’s AI industry, now controlling over 70% of the local cloud-computing chip market. While the H200 is still better for large-scale training, analysts note that the performance gap is narrowing.

For now, Nvidia is still in control. At CES, Huang avoided talking about politics and focused on supply and demand. “We learn about everything through purchase orders,” Huang said. “If the purchase orders come, it’s because they’re able to place purchase orders.”

Right now, the situation looks like a tug-of-war over regulations. The U.S. sometimes loosens rules to collect revenue but also tries to block sales to military sectors. China, seeing that it can’t rely on the U.S., is working hard to build its own technology so it won’t have to depend on American chips in the future.

Conclusion: Value Justifies the Premium Agilent’s valuation premium is best understood through an owner’s lens, not through short-term earnings beats.","is a broad-based life science and analytical instrument company with a product portfolio spanning chromatography (GC/LC), mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, lab automation, vacuum technology, and related software/consumables. This workflow breadth and integrated approach differentiate it from peers. Agilent often wins large multi-instrument lab contracts and then captures high-margin follow-on revenue (service and supplies) through its Agilent CrossLab business.

Its pricing power is evidenced by industry-leading gross margins (~54% in FY2024) lifted by targeted price increases. The company also boasts a rapid innovation cycle for example, in 202223 Agilent introduced first?of?its?kind products like the HydroInert hydrogen-carrier gas source for GC-MS and new automation systems (AssayMAP and Seahorse), reinforcing technological leadership.

In contrast to (focused primarily on chromatography) or (smaller, Asia-centric), Agilent’s scope and recurring revenue streams (services + consumables) give it stronger customer lock-in. Compared to giants like or , Agilent’s pure-play instrument/service model allows leaner operations and faster share gains in niche markets.

Workflow breadth

Agilent uniquely offers end-to-end lab solutions (sample preparation automation, various analytical platforms, instrument-agnostic consumables, and software). It is a major vendor not only of GC/LC but also of mass spec, spectroscopy, and even cell analysis equipment. This contrasts with Waters (mostly HPLC/LCMS) or Shimadzu (strong in GC-MS in Asia but narrower). Agilent’s wide offering lets it bundle products and services across workflows, making customer switching harder.

Pricing power

High recurring volume and product differentiation allow Agilent to maintain healthy pricing. In FY2024, Agilent implemented targeted price increases that expanded overall gross margin by ~4 points to 54.3%stocklight.com, even with mixed sales.

In late 2023, Waters similarly noted gross-margin expansion of 170 bp (to ~59.6%) despite softer orders, but Agilent’s overall margin is buoyed by its service/consumable mix (CrossLab operating margin ~31.9% in FY2024). In practical terms, Agilent can raise prices on instruments and especially on recurring kits/columns year-over-year without losing all volume, a sign of pricing power above commoditized peers.

Innovation cycle

Agilent invests ~78% of sales in R&D, generating a steady stream of new products. Recent innovations (HydroInert, advanced LC columns, automated sample prep) have won awards and share gains. Management notes an innovation engine fueled by AI and technology partnerships.

Such rapid product refresh keeps Agilent’s lineup competitive. By contrast, some peers move more slowly or rely on acquisitions; Agilent’s focused R&D spending and leaner structure mean it can roll out new platforms (and the higher margin they command) faster.

Analyzing the Q4 Financial Beat: Margin and Growth Dynamics

Agilent concluded its fiscal year 2025 with strong operational results, showcasing accelerating momentum. For the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2025, the company reported revenue of $1.86 billion. This figure successfully surpassed the company’s own guidance range (which was $1.822 billion to $1.842 billion) and exceeded consensus expectations. The revenue represented a 9.4% reported increase and a 7.2% core growth rate compared to Q4 2024.

The strong top-line performance translated effectively into the bottom line. Non-GAAP net income reached $452 million, resulting in Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.59. This Non-GAAP EPS grew 9% from the prior year’s quarter and narrowly surpassed analyst forecasts.

GAAP net income was $434 million, or $1.53 per share, representing an even stronger YoY growth of 25%. For the full fiscal year 2025, Agilent generated total revenue of $6.95 billion, a 4.9% core growth increase, with Non-GAAP EPS of $5.59. The modest operating leverage demonstrated, where 9% EPS growth outpaced 7.2% core revenue growth, suggests effective cost management and pricing power were utilized throughout the period.

A critical element of the Q4 performance was the quality of execution demonstrated by management. The 7.2% core growth rate achieved marked the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential core growth acceleration. Management commentary emphasized that these top-line results ""compare very favorably with our peers,"" indicating market share capture and operational strength in a market environment still defined by signs of normalization.

The robust execution performance substantially reduces the intrinsic execution risk modeled into future projections, particularly the outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. Strong current execution means a lower probability of a major shortfall in the subsequent period. The fact that the company is delivering strong financial results while simultaneously planning for ""incremental investments in growth and innovation"" indicates management’s confidence in its operational efficiencies. This level of confidence allows investors and analysts to model future cash flows with a higher degree of certainty, which, in a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation framework, warrants a lower required discount rate, thereby bolstering the calculated intrinsic value.

Execution Excellence Is Structural, Not Cyclical

Agilent’s recent outperformance should not be viewed as a short-term execution win tied to a single quarter. Instead, it reflects a deliberate business architecture designed to perform best during industry downturns, precisely when relative execution differences become visible.

Agilent has intentionally built a large, services- and consumables-heavy revenue stream that is economically tied to its installed base rather than new instrument placements. During tool-sector slowdowns, when customers defer capital equipment purchases, demand for services, compliance support, replacement parts, and consumables does not disappear in many cases; it increases. Labs sweat existing assets harder, raising utilization and service intensity. This makes CrossLab counter-cyclical in practice, not just defensive in theory.

Second, installed-base monetization rises when instrument spending pauses

Unlike peers that rely more heavily on upfront instrument sales, Agilent monetizes customers across the full instrument lifecycle. Once a system is placed, it generates years of high-margin follow-on revenue through qualification, maintenance, software, and consumables. This means that when new system demand normalizes, Agilent continues to compound value from past placements, a dynamic that only becomes visible during downturns.

Third, balance-sheet conservatism enables reinvestment when peers retrench

Agilent’s low leverage and operating discipline inherited from its HP lineage allow it to maintain R&D intensity and make incremental growth investments even during cyclical slowdowns. While more leveraged peers are forced to protect margins or reduce spending, Agilent can play offense: funding innovation, strengthening customer relationships, and selectively investing in capacity or tuck-in acquisitions.

All major life-science tools companies possess elements of these traits, but Agilent’s model combines them more evenly and consistently. This structural resilience is why Agilent’s execution advantage becomes most visible during industry stress and not at cycle peaks.

Navigating Cyclical Normalization

The analytical tools sector is cyclical, tied to lab capex budgets and macro swings. Agilent’s recent earnings illustrate how it handled a downcycle better than most peers. In FY2023 (ended Oct ’23), many labs delayed equipment spend; Agilent’s Life Sciences segment (instruments) fell ~4% on the year (core), but CrossLab grew ~10% core.

Overall revenue was essentially flat (+1.5% core) with GAAP EPS steady at $4.19. Management noted that despite a challenging year for the industry, Agilent delivered leveraged earnings and expects a slow but steady recovery.

By contrast, peers saw sharper declines. For example, Danaher’s Life Sciences business saw a base-business core revenue drop of ~3% (11.5% including acquisitions/spins) in Q3 2023. Waters’ Q4 2023 sales fell ~8% organically, with instrument sales off ~14% even as recurring revenue grew.

Agilent’s more diversified end markets (pharma, biotech, academia, environment, materials) and its heavy tilt toward consumables/services meant it was less exposed to any single slump. Structurally, Agilent benefited from:

Lean cost structure: Even as top-line softened, Agilent held the line on R&D and cut some SG&A, which expanded margins. (FY2024 non-GAAP OPEX shrank ~4% YoYs)

Segment reorganization: In late 2023, Agilent regrouped its units (forming a Life Sciences & Diagnostics Markets Group, etc.), aiming for tighter market focus. This build/buy strategy (including the 2024 BioVectra CDMO acquisition) positioned Agilent to capture growth as markets recover.

Operational discipline: Through the cycle, Agilent generated roughly stable operating cash (~$1.75 B in FY24, similar to $1.77 B in FY23), showing it can sustain cash flow even with uneven revenues.

Capital Efficiency & Value Creation

Agilent’s business model converts sales into cash very efficiently, fueling high ROIC and shareholder returns. In FY2024, it generated ~$1.75 B of operating cash. After capital expenditures ($378 M) and acquisitions, free cash flow ran about $1.4 B (consistent with reporting and analytics). In other words, ~90% of net income flows out as cash.

This is aided by moderate reinvestment: FY2024 capex was only ~6% of (mostly to expand manufacturing, e.g., in diagnostics and CDMO), and R&D spends around 78% of revenue. The result is a high return on invested capital. Agilent’s ROIC has been ~1314% in recent years, meaning each dollar reinvested yields strong profit.

With this cash, Agilent aggressively rewards investors. In FY2024, the company repurchased 8.4 million shares at ~$1.15 Bn and paid $274 M in dividends. That $1.15 Bn buyback alone was ~10% of market cap, cutting share count significantly and boosting EPS. The board has authorized up to $2.0 B more in buybacks. Meanwhile, leverage remains low modest net debt after the BioVectra acquisition. In summary, Agilent turns profit into cash, then redeploys it into growth (BioVectra, R&D) and buybacks, compounding intrinsic value.

Growth Drivers & GLP1 Tailwind

Agilent’s future growth rests on secular trends across life sciences and applied markets. Major end markets include pharma/biotech R&D, diagnostics (e.g., cancer screening), food/environment testing, and advanced materials (semiconductors, EV batteries). In each, demand for precision analysis is rising. For example, as biologic drug R&D grows, so does the need for Agilent’s chromatography and mass spec systems.

The recent cell therapy boom and genomics also help Agilent’s diagnostics tools. In industrial markets, trends like semiconductor reshoring and PFAS water testing require analytical instruments.

GLP-1 peptide drugs (e.g. weight-loss diabetes treatments) have drawn investor hype as a demand driver. Agilent notes that its GLP-1-related sales were about $130 million in FY2025 (split roughly evenly between its new BioVectra manufacturing subsidiary and lab instruments/consumables), which was up ~20% from the prior year. In Q4 alone, GLP-1 work drove ~$40M of revenue.

However, GLP-1s are just one end-market. They accounted for only a few percent of Agilent’s ~$6.8B sales, and growth there partly reflects Air chromatography columns and Oligo synthesis tools that also serve other peptide/oligo markets. We view GLP-1 as a proportional tailwind, not a core moat.

The company itself treats GLP-1 as a subset of its Pharma & Biotech market growth. Over the long run, fundamental drivers remain broader: multi-year CAGR in global lab equipment (?57%), genomics, biologics R&D, and lab automation adoption.

Other growth levers include Agilent’s expanding footprint in high-value fields: its recent BioVectra acquisition (~$145M revenues, specializing in custom synthesis/CDMO for mRNA and oligos) promises to tap booming biologics manufacturing demand. Its Diagnostics & Genomics Group (cancer diagnostics, next-gen sequencing) is small today but growing. Meanwhile, capitalizing on software and AI (integrated lab informatics) could unlock more value per customer (Agilent is asymmetrically investing in software in CrossLab).

Valuation Landscape: Price vs. Intrinsic Value

A deep dive into Agilent’s valuation multiples, comparing the stock against its historical averages and its high-quality peer group, helps determine if the current market price reflects the company’s strong operational execution and robust intrinsic value drivers. As of November 26, 2025, Agilent’s stock trades at a premium when viewed against its recent historical valuation averages.

Agilent Valuation Multiples (Absolute and Historical)

The current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.07x represents an approximate 8.16% premium over the stock’s 5-year average P/E of 33.35x. This premium suggests that the market is already pricing in the expected acceleration in core growth, the achievement of the projected 75 basis points in operating margin expansion, and the de-risking of the business model through the strong Q4 FY2025 execution. The market is effectively assigning a higher growth rate and/or lower risk to Agilent’s future earnings profile relative to its own recent history.

Peer Group Comparison: Benchmarking Execution Quality

Comparing Agilent using the Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiple offers a clearer view of its relative operational valuation, independent of capital structure differences. Agilent trades at 23.7x EV/EBITDA on a trailing twelve months (LTM) basis.

Comparative Valuation Metrics: Life Science & Applied Markets Peers

Agilent’s valuation multiple is slightly higher than or equivalent to its key large peers, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (23.0x EV/EBITDA) and Waters Corporation (22.0x EV/EBITDA). This marginal premium assigned to Agilent validates management’s assertion of superior execution. Despite being smaller than global giants like Thermo Fisher, Agilent is valued equivalently or slightly higher on a per-unit operating profit basis. This market assessment implies that investors are willing to pay a premium for Agilent’s high-quality revenue base (ACG), its demonstrated ability to capture market share, and its focused exposure to powerful secular trends like GLP-1, positioning it as a ""premium-priced growth stabilizer"" within the life science tools sector.

Following the Financial Titans: Recent Guru Activity

Agilent’s valuation premium is further supported by the presence of patient, long-term institutional owners that have historically favored resilient, cash-rich compounders over cyclical earnings stories. Firms such as Durable Capital (Henry Ellenbogen), Capital Group, and Wellington Management all rank among Agilent’s meaningful shareholders, collectively representing a substantial portion of the company’s long-term institutional ownership base.

These firms are known for building concentrated positions in businesses that demonstrate high free-cash-flow conversion, durable competitive advantages, and the ability to reinvest consistently through economic cycles. Durable Capital, in particular, has a track record of backing companies with structurally recurring revenues and strong balance sheets, while Capital Group and Wellington have long emphasized downside resilience and capital preservation alongside growth.

Conclusion: Value Justifies the Premium

Agilent’s valuation premium is best understood through an owner’s lens, not through short-term earnings beats. The company consistently converts a high proportion of operating income into free cash flow, supported by a recurring revenue base that stabilizes cash generation precisely when industry conditions weaken.

The CrossLab business is central to this dynamic. Its recurring, contract-driven revenue stream lowers cash-flow volatility and reduces the risk of capital impairment across cycles. This predictability allows Agilent to self-fund reinvestment through downturns, sustaining R&D, supporting innovation, and strengthening competitive positioning, while peers with higher leverage or more cyclical revenue profiles are forced to pull back.

This combination of high cash conversion, structural recurrence, and balance-sheet strength underpins Agilent’s ability to compound intrinsic value over time. Investors are not paying a premium for growth alone but for a business model that preserves and reinvests capital efficiently across cycles.

Long-term patient capital has historically recognized these traits. Institutions such as Durable Capital, Capital Group, and Wellington have demonstrated sustained interest in companies with resilient cash-flow profiles, disciplined reinvestment, and durable competitive advantages, characteristics that align closely with Agilent’s operating model. Viewed through this lens, Agilent’s modest valuation premium reflects lower business risk and higher long-term capital efficiency, rather than optimism embedded in near-term earnings expectations.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 08:01:29.681434

SPX Technologies Investment Narrative Recap

To own SPX Technologies, I think you need to believe that its HVAC and Detection & Measurement platforms can convert project backlogs and data center demand into durable earnings, despite cyclical and competitive pressures. Whitman’s appointment and the warm-water cooling debate do not appear to change the core near term catalyst, which still centers on executing against data center cooling demand, or the key risk around potential growth lumpiness in the D&M project pipeline.

The most relevant recent development here is Nvidia’s warm-water data center cooling commentary, which briefly pressured SPX’s share price but, according to TD Cowen analysis, still leaves cooling towers as a required part of liquid-cooled designs. For investors focused on SPX’s data center catalyst, this reinforces that the OlympusV Max launch and ongoing capacity expansions matter most, while also highlighting how quickly sentiment can swing on perceived technology shifts.

Yet investors should be aware that if large Detection & Measurement projects pulled into 2025 do not repeat in later years, SPX’s earnings could...

Successor liability arises from the concept of undertaking which defines the infringer in EU antitrust law.
In reality, the apparent inconsistency of the CJEU’s case law on successor liability conceals a clear underlying objective that shapes the EU approach.
Instead, the Commission’s principal aim with successor liability is to secure payment of the fine.
As a first step, antitrust liability should be reframed as a form of substitute liability in the context of M&A successor liability.","Mergers & acquisitions (M&A) practices are often known for their frantic pace, a rhythm that can conflict with the careful consideration required for antitrust issues. Yet, while frequently underestimated in M&A deals, antitrust risks can become quite costly under the EU’s doctrine of successor liability.

Successor liability arises from the concept of undertaking which defines the infringer in EU antitrust law. On this basis, the Commission may attribute liability for antitrust infringements to a legal entity that was not operating the business at the time of the misconduct, including a buyer in an M&A transaction. While this approach broadens the scope of antitrust liability, it stands in tension with fundamental principles of corporate law, which generally preserve the legal separateness of entities and protect shareholders from company debts.

Traditionally, the doctrine of successor liability was applied in three situations: when the original infringer no longer existed, when companies were linked through structural ties, and when the transfer occurred under abusive, non-market conditions. Yet, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) gradually expanded the scope of successor liability through its case law, making its application increasingly unpredictable and creating significant legal uncertainty for M&A transactions.

This uncertainty is illustrated by four factually very similar cases in which the CJEU nevertheless reached four different outcomes. In each case, a company involved in a cartel sold its infringing assets, raising the same legal question: after the transfer, which entity should bear the fine for breaches of EU antitrust law? In Hoechst [2009], liability remained with the original infringer despite the transfer of cartelised assets (para 16), while in Moreda liability was shifted to the newly merged successor notwithstanding a similar transfer of infringing assets (para 318). By contrast, in Parker Hannifin [2014], the Court held the acquirer of the cartel-related assets responsible, allowing liability to follow the transferred assets rather than the original infringer (para 41). Finally, in Prysmian [2020], liability was extended simultaneously to both the former and new parent companies (para 19).

In reality, the apparent inconsistency of the CJEU’s case law on successor liability conceals a clear underlying objective that shapes the EU approach. Contrary to what some scholars suggest, the Commission’s concern here is not primarily deterrence, as it is in the doctrines of parental and subsidiary liability. Parental liability rests on the parent company’s control over the infringing entity at some point in time. By contrast, in cases of successor liability, assuming the infringing activity was discontinued, successors had no such control and thus could not have prevented the infringement. For this reason, deterrence offers little justification for extending liability to successors. Instead, the Commission’s principal aim with successor liability is to secure payment of the fine.

EU legislators should acknowledge this enforcement goal openly and shift the burden away from buyers in M&A transactions, placing it instead on sellers, who are considerably more likely to have exercised control over the infringement at some point in time. This could be achieved through a two-step approach: (1) introducing substitute liability and (2) establishing mandatory escrow accounts.

As a first step, antitrust liability should be reframed as a form of substitute liability in the context of M&A successor liability. The law ought to recognize that buyers had no control over antitrust infringements committed prior to an acquisition, and acquirers should therefore be seen as paying on behalf of the perpetrator rather than being the perpetrator themselves. In practice, this would mean that the successor could be required to satisfy the fine not because it engaged in the infringement, but to ensure that it is collected when no other alternative is available. Borrowing from the 2017 amendments to the German Competition Act, specifically section 81 a, such an obligation would function as a financial guarantee rather than a sanction, placing the acquirer in the role of guarantor rather than culprit.

This approach carries several advantages. It avoids stigmatizing successor companies as cartelists and shields them from reputational harm. It also protects acquirers from regulatory consequences such as repeat-offender status, license revocations, or blacklisting. Codifying this substitute liability would further enhance legal certainty, since buyers would know in advance that they may be pursued as substitute payers. For enforcers, the model is equally attractive: because it does not involve any allegation of wrongdoing, the procedural safeguards attached to fines need not apply. At the same time, it ensures more reliable collection, makes evasion more difficult, and simplifies enforcement by avoiding complex continuity tests and reducing litigation, as the substitute debtor cannot dispute intent or fault.

This brings us to the financial risks faced by acquirers in M&A transactions. Protection from reputational and regulatory consequences, as well as greater legal certainty, offers limited comfort when buyers may still be required to shoulder substantial antitrust fines. To address this concern, the second part of the solution is the introduction of mandatory antitrust escrow accounts to M&A deals.

Escrow accounts were originally a common law mechanism which serve as a financial safeguard and thus complement the benefits of substitute liability. Their trigger event should be the payment of antitrust indemnification claims brought by the buyer or third parties against the target. Crucially, though, to ensure that fines are paid following an M&A deal, such accounts must be subject to both a minimum amount and a minimum term. The reasoning is straightforward: if the funds are insufficient, antitrust fines cannot be paid, and the burden once again shifts from the seller to the buyer.

The escrow amount should cover a substantial portion, though not the entirety, of any potential antitrust fine. The key is to strike a balance: easing the buyer’s financial burden, while addressing moral hazard and avoiding excessive immobilization of the seller’s proceeds. As for the minimum escrow term, the most appropriate benchmark from a buyer’s perspective is the prescriptive period of antitrust fines, excluding disputed sums.

Overall, substitute liability in combination with mandatory escrow accounts could substantially reduce the antitrust related risks faced by acquirers in M&A transactions in Europe. By combining elements from both common law and civil law traditions, this approach would increase legal certainty for buyers, shield them from reputational and regulatory harm, and ensure that a significant share of fines is born by sellers. At the same time, it would facilitate enforcement by guaranteeing payment, even if this means temporarily restricting access to part of seller’s proceeds.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/fileTPSASt,N,,2026-01-09 02:00:11.663884

In personal finance, it is already complicated to rank choices based solely on the risk/return pair.
It is easy to understand that few investments perfectly meet these four criteria, making it complex to rank the options considered.","What a journey from the blackboard to dark chocolate!

From a young age, we learn on the blackboard in math class that if A is greater than B and B is greater than C, then A is greater than C. But very early on, sometimes as soon as the next recess, the game rock-paper-scissors casts doubt on these obvious truths: indeed, the player who shows a hand symbolizing rock beats the one representing scissors, scissors beat paper, but paper beats rock by covering it! Thus, the hierarchy of choices is not so obvious and is so complex that this basic game has given rise to abundant literature on how to win.

The problem of transitivity of preferences becomes more complex when the choice is no longer based on one criterion (in our example, rock wins or loses) but on three criteria to rank options. Imagine Céline hesitating between three boxes of dark chocolates to offer her guests at the New Year's Eve party:

- the ""artisan box"" costs €15 for 12 chocolates with 3 fillings,

- the ""gourmet box"" costs €20 for 20 chocolates with 2 fillings,

- the ""luxury box"" costs €25 for 24 chocolates but with only one filling.

Obviously, on the price criterion, the artisan box is preferred over the gourmet box, which in turn is preferred over the luxury box. For the number of fillings, the gourmet box is preferred over the luxury box; but the luxury box, overlooked in the previous criteria, is preferred over the artisan box for the number of chocolates it contains!

The landmark study2 on intransitivity of preferences in multicriteria choices dates back to 1969. Amos Tversky asked participants to rank 45 candidate profiles by successive pairs according to three criteria (intelligence, emotion and sociability), the first indicated as essential and each quantified by scores. The author highlights the use of the semi-lexicographic order3, which is a decision rule where options are compared according to a hierarchy of criteria, taking into account thresholds to judge whether a difference is relevant. The existence of a sensitivity threshold below which small differences are ignored leads to intransitive preferences and ultimately to contradictions between choices that participants do not perceive at all.

One can easily imagine the complexity of choosing the box of dark chocolates to offer when, moreover, one must choose not according to one’s own (incoherent) preferences but on behalf of someone else!

Not everything is so black!

Thus, even in the presence of clear criteria, choice can be complex. Enough to discourage any desire to make relevant financial decisions. In personal finance, it is already complicated to rank choices based solely on the risk/return pair. Indeed, to be meaningful, one must properly understand the desired level of return and the acceptance of risk (which vary between individuals) but also correctly assess the probabilities of realizing that return and that risk.

The question of transitivity of preferences arises as soon as different criteria are mixed. Yet, the risk/return pair constitutes a criterion to be evaluated just like liquidity (the ability to sell a financial asset without time constraints), volatility (a linear increase in the value of an asset or erratic evolution that can cause the discomfort of a latent loss), or the time dimension (short, medium, or long term). It is easy to understand that few investments perfectly meet these four criteria, making it complex to rank the options considered.

Returning to the reference study on the subject, Tversky compares the results proposed by participants with those given by the Weighted Scoring Technique method, which precisely respects transitivity and coherence. This method ranks options by adding the scores obtained for each of the different criteria, previously weighted.

In this methodology, we find the principle known to students: that of the weighted average of different scores… including that of the math class at the beginning of the article! Like rock-paper-scissors… the circle is closed once again.

Aktis priced 17.65 million shares at $18 each, more than what it planned to sell, according to an updated securities filing earlier this week.
AKY-1189, its most advanced prospect, is a “miniprotein radioconjugate” targeting Nectin-4, the same protein that Pfizer’s bladder cancer drug Padcev binds to.
Prior to its IPO, Aktis banked $346 million in private funding to advance its pipeline of radiopharmaceuticals, including investments from MPM BioImpact, Vida Ventures and RA Capital.
Only one, Ascentage Pharma, was a cancer drug developer.","Radiopharmaceutical drug developer Aktis Oncology on Thursday said it raised $318 million from an initial public offering, the first for a biotechnology company in 2026.

Aktis priced 17.65 million shares at $18 each, more than what it planned to sell, according to an updated securities filing earlier this week. It upsized the round after Eli Lilly, which previously partnered with the cancer drugmaker, stepped in to purchase $100 million, or a third of the shares. Aktis will begin trading Friday on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “AKTS.”

The company, which is based in Boston, is developing a twist on specialized cancer drugs that it says can hit tumor targets “outside the scope” of other radiopharmaceuticals.

AKY-1189, its most advanced prospect, is a “miniprotein radioconjugate” targeting Nectin-4, the same protein that Pfizer’s bladder cancer drug Padcev binds to. Aktis is studying what other cancers it could be used in, with Phase 1 study results expected in the first quarter of 2027.

A second experimental drug, dubbed AKY-2519, goes after solid tumors that express a protein called B7-H3. Tumors with high levels of B7-H3 have been hard to treat, responding poorly to other cancer therapies such as anti-PD1 drugs, according to Aktis. The collaboration with Lilly could yield additional radiopharmaceutical targets.

Prior to its IPO, Aktis banked $346 million in private funding to advance its pipeline of radiopharmaceuticals, including investments from MPM BioImpact, Vida Ventures and RA Capital.

Last year was a slow one for biotech companies looking to raise money on the public markets, with less than a dozen firms pricing IPOs, according to BioPharma Dive data. Only one, Ascentage Pharma, was a cancer drug developer.

But radiopharma companies overall have lured major pharmaceutical firms like Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb. and Novartis. The latter, in particular, saw major success with its radiopharmaceuticals Pluvicto and Lutathera, setting off a chain of acquisitions by other pharmas looking for more precise medicines to attack tumors.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/L9tt3ZM2R1rkC2354eym0s0GuZCz6WlhY_DhaghP5hI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDUxMTE2NzE0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-09 01:00:44.968933

Canada-U.S. flight volumes fell more than 14 per cent year-over-year in the fourth quarter among Canada’s five largest carriers — Air Canada, WestJet, Porter Airlines, Air Transat and Flair Airlines — according to figures from aviation data firm Cirium.

Canadian flight volumes to Cancun, Mexico, jumped by 35 per cent, and to Central America by nearly a third last quarter.","MONTREAL — Canadian airlines pulled back in a big way from the United States over the past year and boosted flight volumes elsewhere — especially the Caribbean — with no sign of a cross-border rebound on the horizon.

Canada-U.S. flight volumes fell more than 14 per cent year-over-year in the fourth quarter among Canada’s five largest carriers — Air Canada, WestJet, Porter Airlines, Air Transat and Flair Airlines — according to figures from aviation data firm Cirium.

Florida, California and Nevada saw some of the biggest drops in capacity from Canadian carriers, with volumes to Las Vegas down by a third from a year earlier.

Meanwhile, as passengers looked farther afield, airlines ramped up flight volumes in the Caribbean and South America — by 36 per cent last quarter and 45 per cent in the current one.

The number of domestic flights and trips to Europe and Asia also rose from 2024 as airlines scrambled to rejig their networks.

Former transport professor Jacques Roy says Canadians’ distaste for U.S. visits triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff war and social policies nonetheless marks a problem for airlines north of the border, which will have to compete in more crowded fields overseas and domestically.

“There is a natural reaction from Canadian travellers, who try to get their suntan from other destinations,"" he said.

Nor are there signs of a return to business as usual. Canadian airline schedules show a 15 per cent drop in U.S. flight volumes during the first three months of this year compared to 2025 — when passengers had already started to shy away from travel to a country whose leader spouted 51st-state rhetoric in reference to its northern neighbour.

First-quarter volumes for Arizona-bound flights are scheduled to fall by more than 20 per cent year-over-year. For Florida, the figure is nearly 19 per cent.

""The airlines were hoping that this was just going to be a flash in the pan ... that it would eventually settle back into a return to sun destinations by the time the fourth quarter rolled along,"" said John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University.

That didn't happen. ""And the first quarter doesn’t look much brighter.”

The first-quarter decrease amounts to nearly 850,000 seats, according to Cirium.

""We see no indication that this trend will change in the foreseeable future, so we are anticipating further reductions to our transborder network in 2026,"" said WestJet spokeswoman Julia Kaiser in an email.

On the plus side, Canadians' appetite for winter air travel has persisted, despite trips that are farther from home and sometimes harder on the wallet.

Air Canada launched more than a dozen fresh routes and several new destinations in the Caribbean and South America — Rio de Janeiro, Guatemala City, and Cartagena, Colombia, among them — over the last few months.

Some beachy getaway spots saw massive surges. WestJet increased flights to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic last quarter to 1,018 from 320 a year earlier.

Canadian flight volumes to Cancun, Mexico, jumped by 35 per cent, and to Central America by nearly a third last quarter. This quarter, they're poised to leap by 104 per cent for the Bahamas, 36 per cent for Brazil, and 28 per cent for Aruba, according to Cirium.

""Canadians are moving and they're trying different destinations,"" Gradek said.

Mark Galardo, Air Canada's chief commercial officer, stressed that the downturn in tourist travel to the U.S. is ""not catastrophic,"" with the decline in its U.S. flight volumes holding steady at about 10 per cent through most of last year and into 2026.

“We see a plateau. The situation has not worsened,"" he said in a phone interview.

Meanwhile, Americans continue to flock to Canada by air. The tally rose more than six per cent year-over-year to 448,000 in October, according to Statistics Canada. And residents of both countries still touch down on each other's turf for layovers on flights to Europe and Asia, keeping planes largely full.

Canadians' thirst for trips to Europe is only partly linked to their aversion to America, Galardo added.

""We're seeing a lot of demand growth into European leisure destinations,"" he said. Hence new routes to Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.

In the U.S., the airline has swapped in smaller planes and lowered flight frequencies to airports in southern states, and even dropped a few routes, he noted.

For its part, Porter had to pivot drastically last year amid a rapid fleet expansion that hinged largely on growth in U.S. markets.

More than 40 per cent of its flight volume stemmed from American trips a year ago, versus just over a quarter now, according to vice-president of network planning Andrew Pierce.

The country's third-largest airline flew zero routes beyond Canada and the U.S. in January 2025; this month it will fly about 500 — to Cancun and Puerto Vallarta in Mexico as well as Costa Rica and the Cayman Islands.

""We're new to a lot of that region of the world, but it's exactly the right timing for the demand,"" Pierce said.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the “Company”), healthcare’s leading, most comprehensive innovation powerhouse, today announced a voluntary agreement with the Trump Administration to improve access to medicines and lower costs for millions of American patients. The joint agreement meets the requests laid out by President Trump to the industry and provides the Company’s pharmaceutical products an exemption from tariffs1.

“Today’s agreement shows that when the public and private sectors work together towards shared goals, we can deliver real results for patients and the U.S. economy,” said Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “I’m proud that Johnson & Johnson is answering President Trump’s call to lower drug prices for everyday Americans while maintaining our role in improving and saving lives and ensuring that the United States continues to lead the world in healthcare innovation.”

Improving Access and Lowering Costs for U.S. Patients

Johnson & Johnson is working with the Trump Administration to improve access to medicines and lower costs for millions of American patients. The Company is:

Participating in TrumpRx.gov, a direct to patient platform, which will allow millions of American patients to purchase medicines from Johnson & Johnson at significantly discounted rates.

Enabling American patients to access medicines at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Providing Medicaid program access at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Continuing to support the Administration's efforts to ensure better recognition of the value of health care across developed markets globally.

Delivering On Our $55B U.S. Investment

Johnson & Johnson also continues to deliver on our previously announced $55 billion investment to support U.S. manufacturing, research and development, and technology investments by early 2029. In just the last 10 months, the Company has initiated billions of dollars in investment in U.S. manufacturing, which will support the Company’s goal of manufacturing the vast majority of its advanced medicines in the U.S. to meet the needs of U.S. patients.

Today, as part of the $55 billion investment, the Company is announcing two new U.S. manufacturing facilities, including a next generation cell therapy manufacturing site in Pennsylvania and a state-of-the-art drug product manufacturing facility in North Carolina.

Additionally, construction is progressing on our $2 billion state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina, which the Company broke ground on last year. That project will create approximately 5,000 skilled manufacturing and construction jobs in the state. Johnson & Johnson is already ramping up the hiring of advanced manufacturing employees to work at the facility.

In September, the Company also secured a new 160,000+ square foot dedicated biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The $2 billion commitment over the next 10 years will create approximately 120 new jobs in North Carolina.

Johnson & Johnson expects to announce additional U.S. investments later this year.

Prospectus Supplement dated November 16, 2023Prospectus dated April 12, 2024

The notes are not deposits or savings accounts and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

The Notes

The notes are debt securities of Morgan Stanley. We describe the basic features of these notes in the sections of the accompanying prospectus called “Description of Debt Securities—Fixed Rate Debt Securities” and prospectus supplement called “Description of Notes,” subject to and as modified by the provisions described below. All payments on the notes are subject to the credit risk of Morgan Stanley.

The stated principal amount and issue price of each note is $1,000. This price includes costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes, which are borne by you, and, consequently, the estimated value of the notes on the pricing date will be less than the issue price. We estimate that the value of each note on the pricing date will be approximately $976.50 or within $56.50 of that estimate. Our estimate of the value of the notes as determined on the pricing date will be set forth in the final pricing supplement.

What goes into the estimated value on the pricing date?

In valuing the notes on the pricing date, we take into account that the notes comprise both a debt component and a performance-based component linked to interest rates. The estimated value of the notes is determined using our own pricing and valuation models, market inputs and assumptions relating to volatility and other factors including current and expected interest rates, as well as an interest rate related to our secondary market credit spread, which is the implied interest rate at which our conventional fixed rate debt trades in the secondary market.

What determines the economic terms of the notes?

In determining the economic terms of the notes, including the interest rate applicable to each interest payment period, we use an internal funding rate, which is likely to be lower than our secondary market credit spreads and therefore advantageous to us. If the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging costs borne by you were lower or if the internal funding rate were higher, one or more of the economic terms of the securities would be more favorable to you.

What is the relationship between the estimated value on the pricing date and the secondary market price of the notes?

The price at which MS & Co. purchases the notes in the secondary market, absent changes in market conditions, including those related to interest rates, may vary from, and be lower than, the estimated value on the pricing date, because the secondary market price takes into account our secondary market credit spread as well as the bid-offer spread that MS & Co. would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type, the costs of unwinding the related hedging transactions and other factors.

MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the notes and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time.

Risk Factors

The notes involve risks not associated with an investment in ordinary fixed rate notes. This section describes the material risks relating to the notes. For a complete list of risk factors, please see the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus. Investors should consult their financial and legal advisers as to the risks entailed by an investment in the notes and the suitability of the notes in light of their particular circumstances.

Risks Relating to an Investment in the Notes

￭Investors are subject to our credit risk, and any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings or credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the notes. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the notes on interest payment dates and at maturity and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. The notes are not guaranteed by any other entity. If we default on our obligations under the notes, your investment would be at risk and you could lose some or all of your investment. As a result, the market value of the notes prior to maturity will be affected by changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any actual or anticipated decline in our credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking our credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes.

￭The price at which the notes may be sold prior to maturity will depend on a number of factors and may be substantially less than the amount for which they were originally purchased. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to: (i) actual or anticipated changes in interest and yield rates, (ii) any actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads and (iii) time remaining to maturity.Generally, the longer the time remaining to maturity and the more tailored the exposure, the more the market price of the notes will be affected by the other factors described in the preceding sentence. This can lead to significant adverse changes in the market price of securities like the notes. Depending on the actual or anticipated level of interest and yield rates, the market value of the notes is expected to decrease and you may receive substantially less than 100% of the issue price if you are able to sell your notes prior to maturity.

￭The rate we are willing to pay for securities of this type, maturity and issuance size is likely to be lower than the rate implied by our secondary market credit spreads and advantageous to us. Both the lower rate and the inclusion of costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes in the original issue price reduce the economic terms of the notes, cause the estimated value of the notes to be less than the original issue price and will adversely affect secondary market prices. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors, the prices, if any, at which dealers, including MS & Co., are willing to purchase the notes in secondary market transactions will likely be significantly lower than the original issue price, because secondary market prices will exclude the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging-related costs that are included in the original issue price and borne by you and because the secondary market prices will reflect our secondary market credit spreads and the bid-offer spread that any dealer would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type, the costs of unwinding the related hedging transactions as well as other factors.

The inclusion of the costs of issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes in the original issue price and the lower rate we are willing to pay as issuer make the economic terms of the notes less favorable to you than they otherwise would be.

￭The estimated value of the notes is determined by reference to our pricing and valuation models, which may differ from those of other dealers and is not a maximum or minimum secondary market price. These pricing and valuation models are proprietary and rely in part on subjective views of certain market inputs and certain assumptions about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, because there is no market-standard way to value these types of securities, our models may yield a higher estimated value of the notes than those generated by others, including other dealers in the market, if they attempted to value the notes. In addition, the estimated value on the pricing date does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which dealers, including MS & Co., would be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The value of your notes at any time after the date of this pricing supplement will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including our creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.

￭The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and secondary trading may be limited. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore, there may be little or no secondary market for the notes. MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the notes and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time. When it does make a market, it will generally do so for transactions of routine secondary market size at prices based on its estimate of the current value of the notes, taking into account its bid/offer spread, our credit spreads, market volatility, the notional size of the proposed sale, the cost of unwinding any related hedging positions, the time remaining to maturity and the likelihood that it will be able to resell the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Since other broker-dealers may not participate significantly in the secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which MS & Co. is willing to transact. If, at any time, MS & Co. were to cease making a market in the notes, it is likely that there would be no secondary market for the notes. Accordingly, you should be willing to hold your notes to maturity.

Use of Proceeds and Hedging

The proceeds we receive from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes. We will receive, in aggregate, $1,000 per note issued, because, when we enter into hedging transactions in order to meet our obligations under the notes, our hedging counterparty will reimburse the cost of the Agent’s commissions. The costs of the notes borne by you and described on page 2 above comprise the Agent’s commissions and the cost of issuing, structuring and hedging the notes.

Supplemental Information Concerning Plan of Distribution; Conflicts of Interest

The agent may distribute the notes through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley Wealth Management”), as selected dealer, or other dealers, which may include Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“MSIP”) and Bank Morgan Stanley AG. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, MSIP and Bank Morgan Stanley AG are affiliates of Morgan Stanley. Selected dealers, including Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, and their financial advisors will collectively receive from the agent, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, a fixed sales commission of $ for each note they sell; provided that dealers selling to investors purchasing the notes in fee-based advisory accounts will not receive a sales commission with respect to such notes.

MS & Co. is our wholly owned subsidiary and it and other subsidiaries of ours expect to make a profit by selling, structuring and, when applicable, hedging the notes. When MS & Co. prices this offering of notes, it will determine the economic terms of the notes such that for each note the estimated value on the pricing date will be no lower than the minimum level described in “The Notes” on page 2.

MS & Co. will conduct this offering in compliance with the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., which is commonly referred to as FINRA, regarding a FINRA member firm’s distribution of the securities of an affiliate and related conflicts of interest. MS & Co. or any of our other affiliates may not make sales in this offering to any discretionary account.

Acceleration Amount in Case of an Event of Default

In case an event of default with respect to the notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per note upon any acceleration of the notes shall be an amount in cash equal to the stated principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In its decision letter, the agency acknowledges the controlled clinical trials submitted by Vanda demonstrates positive efficacy signals.
Following the legal proceeding, in October 2025, the agency and Vanda agreed to a re-review of its supplemental new drug application (NDA) conducted under a collaborative framework agreement between the two parties.
Under the agreement, the agency committed to an expedited re-review of the application by January 7, 2026, including considerations of narrower, sleep-focused indications.

In its decision letter, the agency acknowledges the controlled clinical trials submitted by Vanda demonstrates positive efficacy signals. However, FDA determined that the data did not constitute substantial evidence of effectiveness for jet lag disorder.1

The decision comes against the backdrop of previous legal proceedings, as in August 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside FDA’s earlier refusal to approve of Hetlioz for jet lag disorder. The court characterized Vanda’s evidence as “specific, reasoned, and rooted in evidence,” while labeling the FDA’s earlier review as “cursory,” noting statistically significant improvements on primary endpoints across trials.

Following the legal proceeding, in October 2025, the agency and Vanda agreed to a re-review of its supplemental new drug application (NDA) conducted under a collaborative framework agreement between the two parties. Under the agreement, the agency committed to an expedited re-review of the application by January 7, 2026, including considerations of narrower, sleep-focused indications.

How did FDA come to its decision?

FDA based its conclusion on its assessment of the controlled phase advance protocols used in the studies, specifically five-hour and eight-hour shifts in bedtime, claiming the shifts do not sufficiently reflect real-world jet travel.1 The agency cited several aspects associated with air travel, such as reduced cabin pressure, physical constraints, noise, and lighting changes, as elements not captured by the study designs.1

Vanda continues to dispute FDA’s interpretation, highlighting the widespread use of phase advance models in circadian rhythm research as established methods for simulating the core biological misalignment associated with eastward jet lag.1 The company has maintained its stance, saying that the models isolate circadian disruption without introducing additional variables related to travel conditions. The company also cited data from studies involving both simulated protocols and actual transatlantic travel, saying the data demonstrates improvements in sleep duration, time to persistent sleep, and next-day alertness.1

The company further noted that Hetlioz has an established safety profile which is supported by more than a decade of market experience in its approved chronic indications, including adverse events described as predominantly mild.

Vanda maintains that its submission met the statutory standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness on clinically relevant endpoints for jet lag disorder.

Although Vanda stated that it welcomed FDA’s engagement during the re-review process, the company does not believe the latest decision fully reflects the court’s concerns regarding engagement with the evidence, with Vanda saying it intends to continue discussions with the agency while considering additional steps related to the application.1This includes the company saying it will “pursue all appropriate avenues” in order to advance the approval of Hetlioz.

The company got into the space early, focusing the design of its chips to suit this technology, and that's resulted in a No. 1 position in the market. As a result, Nvidia's revenue has soared, and the stock price has followed as investors rushed to get in on this success story. Nvidia shares have advanced 1,100% over the past three years.

Though this picture is bright, investors still look expectantly to Nvidia for signs of what's next -- and what may keep the revenue momentum going. After all, the company isn't alone in this dynamic space. It faces mounting competition from rivals such as Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. And it even faces the possibility that customers such as Alphabet will rely more heavily on their in-house designed chips and buy fewer Nvidia products down the road.

Just this week, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang spoke at the consumer electronics event known as CES, a forum for product announcements and innovation updates, and he offered a clear picture of what's ahead for the company. In fact, Huang delivered brilliant news to Nvidia investors for 2026.

Nvidia's promise

First, though, it's important to take a quick look at the Nvidia story so far and a promise the company has made to customers and investors. As mentioned, Nvidia was first to market with its graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI, and this helped the company establish leadership. These GPUs drive the critical steps needed to get the AI show on the road, from the training of models to putting them to work.

Nvidia didn't stop there and instead added a wide selection of related products and services to its repertoire -- and that has made it a source that customers can turn to for any of their AI needs. The company also has been proactive, designing platforms in areas such as robotics to drive the AI developments of the future.

At the same time, Nvidia made a promise several quarters ago to those depending on it for technology and growth. The company pledged to update its GPUs on an annual basis, and it's followed through on that with the launch of the Blackwell architecture in late 2024 and then the Blackwell Ultra update last year. Both products met with enormous demand, generating billions of dollars for Nvidia.

Jensen Huang at CES

And this brings me to Huang's announcement at CES. It's as simple as this: The company's Rubin platform is in full production. That puts this next update on track for release this year, once again fulfilling Nvidia's promise. Rubin features five innovations, including the latest NVLink communications link and the Vera central processing unit (CPU). (CPUs are the main chips that power computers.)

But this isn't the only chip involved. In fact, Rubin includes six chips all designed together, in a process called ""extreme codesign"" -- and this has resulted in tremendous gains in efficiency. This integration of chips allows Rubin to offer benefits such as reducing inference token costs by as much as 10 times, and its switch systems help Rubin to offer major improvements in power efficiency and uptime.

So, this platform sounds solid -- but why is this announcement such fantastic news right now? There are three reasons. First, it's yet another example of Nvidia keeping its word and demonstrating that it can innovate and launch a major product on an annual basis. Second, innovations are key because they are what should keep Nvidia in its leadership position. It will be very difficult for a rival to beat Nvidia when new launches happen once a year.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849808%2Fgettyimages-1335027284.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-08 20:02:00.823286

With the docking of Mt New Renown, which has a total cargo capacity of 3.3 lakh m3 (meter cube), Mundra became the first port in India to handle Fully Laden VLCC at Berth, the Adani Group company said in a statement.

The handling of Mt New Renown was executed under challenging conditions with strong currents, winds and sea states, showcasing expertise, coordination and operational excellence of the APSEZ marine team and port management.

Mundra’s VLCC jetty is seamlessly connected via a 489 km crude oil pipeline to the HPCL Rajasthan Refinery at Barmer — one of India’s most strategic refining assets.

This direct connectivity significantly enhances India’s energy security; efficiency of large-scale crude imports; supply chain resilience; and regional economic growth across Gujarat and Rajasthan.

With this achievement, Mundra Port is now among select global crude handling hubs, strengthening India’s position in the global maritime and energy map. Mundra’s advanced vessel-handling capability eliminates dependency on offshore Single Point Moorings (SPMs) or lightering operations that were traditionally used for such large vessels, said the company.

“This development also highlights Mundra’s significance as the first port in the country and among a select few in the world to have a dedicated jetty capable of directly berthing fully laden VLCCs,” it added.

Mundra Port features 27 operational berths and two Single Point Moorings (SPMs); capability to handle dry bulk, break-bulk, project cargo, liquids, containers, automobiles, and crude oil and accommodation of Cape size vessels, VLCCs and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCCs) and ultra large container vessels (ULCVs).

Mundra became the first port in India to handle over 200 million metric tonnes (MMT) of cargo in a single year in 2024-25, reinforcing its unmatched scale and operational leadership.

If the Court is looking for an opportunity to bring coherence to FLSA collective actions, Richards is it.","As the Supreme Court prepares its docket for the New Year, Richards v. Eli Lilly stands out as a case with the potential to fundamentally alter the landscape of wage-and-hour collective actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).[1] At issue is a deceptively simple but deeply consequential question: What must a plaintiff show before a federal court may authorize notice to other employees in a collective action under FLSA § 216(b)?

The Court is scheduled to consider the employer’s Petition at conference this Friday. A grant of certiorari could signal its readiness to address a three-way circuit split that has only deepened in recent years, and to clarify a procedural regime that, for decades, has evolved largely through lower-court innovation unmoored to the FLSA’s text and without any Supreme Court guidance.

This alert summarizes the Supreme Court filings and assesses why the Court’s odds of taking up the case are higher than in an average cert petition.

Why Richards Is on the Supreme Court’s Radar

The FLSA’s collective-action mechanism is unique in federal law. Section 216(b) allows employees to sue on behalf of others who are “similarly situated,” but—unlike Rule 23 class actions—requires affirmative opt-in. The statute is silent on when and how courts should determine similarity, what evidentiary showing is required, and how much scrutiny should occur before court-authorized notice issues.

This statutory silence has produced a fractured legal landscape. That’s why the question presented in Richards is procedural but pivotal: What evidentiary standard governs a district court’s decision to authorize notice to putative collective members under § 216(b)? Lower courts have adopted at least four divergent approaches:

Lenient “modest showing” standard traditionally derived from Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. (D.N.J. 1987),

Fifth Circuit’s preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in Swales v. KLLM Transport Services (2021),

Sixth Circuit’s “strong likelihood” standard in Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC (2023),

Seventh Circuit’s “material factual dispute” standard in Richards v. Eli Lilly (2025).

These approaches differ not only in name but in substance. Some require meaningful discovery and early adjudication of contested facts, while others allow notice on largely untested allegations in a rubber-stamp approach to notice. The inconsistency affects litigation risk, discovery burdens, and settlement incentives for employers nationwide.[2]

Richards arrives at a moment when the tensions between the circuits’ varying approaches are impossible to ignore, and the Supreme Court’s intervention could bring long-overdue clarity.

The FLSA Issues Teed Up for Review

Is Court-Authorized Notice a Meaningful Judicial Act—or a Ministerial Step?

Eli Lilly’s petition argues that authorizing notice is not a neutral or inconsequential act. Once a trial court authorizes notice to putative members of the collective, wage and hour lawsuits often expand dramatically, discovery costs soar, and settlement pressure intensifies. The Petition challenges the Lusardi premise that notice can be issued on minimal evidence because it is “preliminary,” and urges the Court to treat notice as a meaningful judicial act requiring rigorous analysis.

What Does “Similarly Situated” Require—And When?

The circuits disagree not only on how much evidence is required, but also on when similarity must be evaluated:

Fifth Circuit: Requires courts to resolve similarity before notice by a preponderance of the evidence.

Sixth Circuit: Demands a “strong likelihood” of similarity.

Seventh Circuit: Adopts a “material factual dispute” standard, allowing more discretion.

Each standard reflects a fundamentally different view of § 216(b): Is similarity a threshold gatekeeping requirement, or can it be postponed until after notice has already reshaped the litigation?

How Much Discretion Should District Courts Have?

Richards’ opposition brief emphasizes district court discretion and argues that variability is a feature, not a flaw. Eli Lilly and its amici, by contrast, frame unfettered discretion as the problem—arguing that without a uniform rule, outcomes depend more on geography than law.

The Supreme Court Filings: A National Debate

Eli Lilly’s Petition for Certiorari frames Richards as an opportunity to address foundational questions about the role of courts in FLSA collective actions. The employer argues for clarifying the implications that arise from Hoffmann-La Roche or, at minimum, requiring rigorous proof of similarity before notice. In response, Richards defends the Seventh Circuit’s “middle-ground” approach as reasonable and consistent with congressional intent.

The parties to the case are not the only ones who have voiced their arguments in favor and in opposition to certiorari. One of the most significant developments at the cert-stage is the sheer number and nature of the amicus briefs supporting review. Six separate amicus briefs have been filed in support of the petition. These briefs come from a diverse array of stakeholders including major business trade associations, employer groups, and public policy organizations across the country.

Among the six amicus briefs supporting Eli Lilly, the brief filed by the State of Ohio—joined by 19 other states and the Arizona Legislature—stands out. The 20 states made several important points in favor of granting Eli Lilly’s Petition:

Sovereign and Fiscal Impact: The brief emphasizes that states, as large employers, are increasingly targeted by FLSA collective actions. The amici argue that the current regime—where courts can authorize notice to non-parties based on minimal evidence—imposes “steep costs” on state treasuries and undermines states’ ability to govern their workforces.

Constitutional Concerns: The brief contends that court-facilitated notice to non-parties exceeds the traditional bounds of judicial power under Article III, as it invites individuals who are not yet parties into litigation, contrary to the adversarial model.

Statutory Silence: The amici highlight that neither the FLSA nor the ADEA authorizes courts to recruit new plaintiffs, and that the judicially created notice regime is untethered from statutory text or historical practice.

Patchwork Standards and Forum-shopping: The brief underscores the practical problems caused by the circuit split, noting that the lack of a uniform standard encourages forum-shopping and creates unpredictability for employers nationwide.

The amici urge the Court to adopt a clear, rigorous standard for notice that protects both public and private employers from the burdens of overbroad collective actions.

Why the Certiorari Posture Is Unusually Strong

Estimating certiorari odds is inherently speculative, but several predictors of Supreme Court review that serve as useful guideposts are present here:

Deep, Acknowledged Circuit Split: At least three courts of appeals have adopted distinct and incompatible standards, and the Seventh Circuit expressly declined to follow either of the others. The result is a patchwork regime that virtually invites forum-shopping.

Significant Amicus Engagement: Six amicus briefs at the cert stage—particularly in a procedural employment case—signal broad national importance. The Ohio-led brief, joined by South Carolina and other states, highlights the issue’s impact on public sector employers.

Squarely Presented Legal Question: The opposition brief defends the Seventh Circuit’s rule on the merits, confirming that the legal question is squarely presented and vigorously contested.

Beyond the merits presented by the Petition, Richards aligns with the Court’s broader institutional priorities. For example, the Court has shown increasing interest in ensuring that procedural shortcuts do not effectively determine case outcomes. The Court has also reinforced the importance of text, structure, and historical practice in interpreting the role and authority of the courts, a factor that weighs in favor of a narrow construction of the collective-action mechanism of § 216. And if those fail, the Court has shown an interest in creating uniform federal procedure to limit forum-shopping incentivized by the current three-way split, which undermines predictability for employers and employees alike.

What to Watch Going Forward

If the Court grants certiorari, Richards could become the most significant FLSA procedural decision since Hoffmann-La Roche. The Court could:

Clarify Hoffmann-La Roche: Eliminating court-facilitated notice would fundamentally reshape FLSA collective actions.

Adopt a Uniform, Heightened Standard: Requiring plaintiffs to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence (or a “strong likelihood”), that others are similarly situated before notice issues.

Endorse the Seventh Circuit’s Middle-Ground Approach: Allowing for more judicial discretion but requiring consideration of both sides’ evidence.

Maintain the Status Quo: Leaving the current forum-dependent landscape—and its attendant risks—in place.

For employers, the stakes are high: A Supreme Court decision could recalibrate early-stage leverage in collective actions, reshape notice practices nationwide, and provide long-overdue clarity on the meaning of “similarly situated” under § 216(b). The case is worth close attention not because it guarantees a particular outcome, but because it presents the Court with a clean vehicle to impose order on an increasingly fractured area of wage-and-hour law.

Conclusion

Richards v. Eli Lilly is not just another employment dispute—it is a strong candidate for review. The combination of a three-way circuit split, significant amicus engagement, and a fundamental disagreement over how courts should administer a core federal statute makes this case one to watch closely as the Court shapes its 2026 docket.

If the Court is looking for an opportunity to bring coherence to FLSA collective actions, Richards is it.

Sign up Stay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.","As new Walmart CEO John Furner prepares to take over from Doug McMillon in February, Furner can expect the retail giant’s artificial intelligence (AI) and agentic commerce strategies to come up frequently as he decides how to best put agents and machine learning to use.

“Every job we’ve got is going to change in some way — whether it’s getting the shopping carts off the parking lot, or the way our technologists work, or certainly the way leadership roles change,” McMillon said during a Harvard Business Review event in November, according to an Axios report from that day.

That statement came toward the end of a big year for Walmart’s AI endeavors, which already stretched across its operations from online and omnichannel shopping to how its employees work at stores and build internal tools to benefit the organization. In addition to developing its own AI and machine learning capabilities, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also works with OpenAI in key areas that factor into its plans for 2026.

How Walmart is using AI for its agents and ‘super agents’

Suresh Kumar, the global chief technology officer and chief development officer at Walmart, used the phrase “super agents” to describe how Walmart is using AI not just to enhance customer service and experience, but also to manage lesser AI agents in targeted areas with larger agents that operate at higher levels.

“We’ve been building agents — fast — for every aspect of the business,” he wrote in a July 2025 LinkedIn post.

Walmart gave those super agents their own names:

Sparky, which is Walmart’s virtual assistant for shoppers.

My Assistant, a tool that Walmart associates use for tasks ranging from scheduling meetings to engaging with data sets.

Marty, which assists Walmart partners and will play an increasing role in advertising.

WIBEY, a super agent designed to help Walmart developers.

In addition, Walmart created a generative AI-powered assistant named Wally, which it built to aid employees with merchandising tasks.

What is ChatGPT’s role in agentic commerce for Walmart?

At the beginning of the 2025 holiday shopping season, Walmart announced a major expansion of its work with OpenAI, which Walmart called “agentic commerce in action.” Previously, Walmart detailed that it would collaborate with OpenAI on certification and training through the Walmart Academy program. In the latest partnership, consumers can purchase Walmart products within OpenAI’s ChatGPT experience.

That functionality includes the use of ChatGPT’s “instant checkout” experience for completing purchases. Walmart followed early adopters Etsy and Shopify to begin making use of the option.

Walmart web sales by year

Internal AI resources

Even as a super agent, WIBEY was built on top of Element, which is Walmart’s proprietary machine learning platform. Designed to use Kubernetes, Walmart uses Element to support technology deployments across multiple cloud-based contexts, as well as for hardware-accelerated experiments and integrations with enterprise services.

“Element is purpose-built to support the full lifecycle of intelligent workflows, from experimentation to production at scale,” wrote Sravana Karnati, executive vice president of global technology platforms at Walmart Global Tech, in an August 2025 blog post. “Designed for distributed, scalable, and production-ready AI, Element simplifies infrastructure, accelerates development, and empowers teams to focus on delivering impact.”

The scope of these efforts speaks to multiple layers of technology that a company the size of Walmart is able to use, as well as the wide reach those systems have across its various divisions.

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

While Albertsons Companies currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","Albertsons Companies NYSE: ACI presents a compelling value proposition in 2026, but the question is whether it is an opportunity for investors, and the signs suggest it is. While price action is bearish, results are outperforming expectations, and stock accumulation is underway. The company’s Q3 earnings report highlights continued outperformance versus expectations, reinforcing the bullish case despite bearish price action.

It is only a matter of time before this stock price reconnects with reality, and when it does, the gains that follow could be explosive. Semi-explosive, at least.

This isn’t exactly a high-growth story. We’re talking about a value-and-yield combination that suggests a high double-digit total return by the end of 2026 and the potential for a sustained rally as growth is reinvigorated.

Albertsons Presents a Favorable Value-and-Yield Combination

On a value basis, Albertsons trades at only 8x its current-year earnings outlook and 6x the 2030 consensus forecast, a discount relative to its peers every way you look at it. There are not many publicly traded direct competitors; Kroger NYSE: KR is number one, and Albertsons is number two. Kroger, the larger of the two, trades at 12x this year’s earnings and 10x the 2030 consensus, suggesting a minimum 50% upside is possible for ACI stock. Other comparisons, including those with regional player Ingles Markets NASDAQ: IMKTA and big-box stores such as Walmart NASDAQ: WMT and Costco NASDAQ: COST, reveal even more favorable valuations.

Thedividend yield heightens the value. Albertsons pays a reliable 60 cents as of early 2026, yielding approximately 3.5%, compared to a competitor range that tops out under 3%. The highest-yielding competitor is regional grocer Village Super Markets; the critical comparison is to Kroger, which yields about 2.25% with a similar payout ratio. Albertsons' dividend payout is under 30% of the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) earnings consensus, according to MarketBeat, and the company has exceeded its targets every quarter so far.

Value and yield are among the reasons why the institutions accumulated in 2025. The data reveals mixed activity in Q4, with selling outpacing buying ever so slightly, but bullish behavior for the year. Institutions bought on balance each quarter at a pace of approximately $3 for each $1 sold and are likely to continue accumulating in 2026. The forecast is for this company to sustain its modest growth pace and to widen margins.

Tepid Guidance Sends ACI Shares to New Lows

Albertsons' Q4 FY2025 guidance fell short of the consensus, sending shares to new lows. However, the guidance adjustment merely narrowed the range, forecasting a mid-point slightly below the consensus. The takeaway is that growth is expected, including earnings, sustaining the capital return outlook. Data in the report also reveals strengths, including in comparable sales, digital channels, and loyalty, which underpin growth across the retail universe. The likely outcome is that Q4 guidance is cautious, and that a catalyst for a rebound may emerge before mid-year.

Catalysts in 2026 include the company’s strategic shift, increased loyalty engagement, and improved clarity now that the Kroger merger issues are behind it. The strategic shift focuses on digital, specifically its retail media network, which helps the grocery company leverage its growing loyalty base. The retail media network enables the company to sell ad space on its websites and apps, targeting specific shoppers and is a higher-margin business.

Albertsons Stock Overextends After Q3 Release

Albertsons' stock price has been under pressure for many quarters and is overextended in early 2026. Both the MACD and stochastic indicators reflect significant divergences, suggesting that a lack of buyers, rather than a dearth of sellers, is driving the market. In this scenario, the stock price is set up to rebound sharply and could do so at any time. The risk is that ACI stock will continue to drift lower until later in the year when more news is available. In that scenario, it could move to the post-IPO lows near $14 before rebounding.

But a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist on Tuesday might give investors pause.

The chart, shared in a client note from Société Générale's Albert Edwards, shows the US unemployment rate (in red) alongside its three-year moving average (dotted line). Since 1950, in eight instances where the unemployment rate has begun an uptrend and broken through its three-year moving average, a recession has followed.

""Recession is the biggest threat to equities, although in recent downturns financial problems have preceded (or caused) recessions,"" Edwards wrote in the note. ""I don't think any guru is forecasting a recession in 2026. Yet the simple correlation shown below has a 100% track record of success.""

The chart mirrors the concept of the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which says that the US economy is in a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by more than 0.5% from its lows over the previous 12 months. In other words, if unemployment rises too quickly, it signals that things are about to get worse.

Although it had been hailed for its back-tested accuracy since its release in 2019, the gauge produced its first false reading in August 2024.

It remains to be seen if the labor market weakens materially, as Edwards' chart suggests could happen. Hiring rates and job openings remain sluggish. But other important measures of the economy's health — like consumer spending and GDP growth — remain strong.

Another signal that a recession could be on the way, according to Edwards, is a steepening of the Treasury yield curve following its inversion. However, while falling short-term rates following an inversion are usually accompanied by a floundering job market and consumer, today's economy seems to be in a stronger starting place.",https://i.insider.com/695ec1f064858d02d217f102?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 17:14:24.815320

Risk Considerations

The risks set forth below are discussed in more detail in the “Risk Factors” section in the preliminary pricing supplement. Please review those risk factors carefully prior to making an investment decision.

Risks Relating to Return Characteristics

▪The securities do not guarantee the return of any principal and your investment in the securities may result in a loss.

▪The contingent payment, if any, is based solely on the closing prices of the underlying equity on the specified determination dates.

▪You will not receive any contingent payment for any period where the closing price of the underlying equity on the determination date is less than the downside threshold level.

▪Higher contingent payments are generally associated with a greater risk of loss.

▪Early redemption risk.

▪Investors will not participate in any appreciation in the closing price of the underlying equity and will not have the same rights as holders of the underlying equity.

Risks Relating to Characteristics of the Underlying Equity

▪Single equity risk.

▪There can be no assurance that the investment view implicit in the securities will be successful.

▪No affiliation with the underlying equity issuer.

Estimated Value Considerations

▪The issue price you pay for the securities will exceed their estimated initial value.

▪The estimated initial value is a theoretical price and the actual price that you may be able to sell your securities in any secondary market (if any) at any time after the pricing date may differ from the estimated initial value.

▪Our actual profits may be greater or less than the differential between the estimated initial value and the issue price of the securities as of the pricing date.

Risks Relating to Liquidity and Secondary Market Price Considerations

▪There may be little or no secondary market for the securities.

▪The price at which UBS Securities LLC and its affiliates may offer to buy the securities in the secondary market (if any) may be greater than UBS’ valuation of the securities at that time, greater than any other secondary market prices provided by unaffiliated dealers (if any) and, depending on your broker, greater than the valuation provided on your customer account statements.

▪Price of securities prior to maturity.

▪Impact of fees and the use of internal funding rates rather than secondary market credit spreads on secondary market prices.

Risks Relating to Hedging Activities and Conflicts of Interest

▪Potential conflicts of interest.

▪Hedging and trading activities by the calculation agent and its affiliates could potentially affect the value of, and any amounts payable on, the securities.

▪We may engage in business with or involving the underlying equity issuer without regard to your interests.

▪Potential UBS impact on an underlying equity.

▪Following certain events, the calculation agent can make adjustments to the underlying equity and terms of the securities that may adversely affect the market value of, and return on, the securities.

Risks Relating to General Credit Characteristics

▪The securities are subject to the credit risk of UBS, and any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings or credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the securities.

▪The securities are not bank deposits.

▪If UBS experiences financial difficulties, FINMA has the power to open restructuring or liquidation proceedings in respect of, and/or impose protective measures in relation to, UBS, which proceedings or measures may have a material adverse effect on the terms and market value of the securities and/or the ability of UBS to make payments thereunder.

Risks Relating to U.S. Federal Income Taxation

▪Uncertain tax treatment. Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” in the preliminary pricing supplement and “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”, including the section “— Securities Treated as Prepaid Derivatives or Prepaid Forwards with Associated Contingent Coupons”, in the accompanying product supplement.

Trial to resolve all claims in the Anaptys and Tesaro/GSK dispute is scheduled for July 14-17, 2026

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 08, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AnaptysBio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANAB), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative immunology therapeutics, filed a partial motion to dismiss Tesaro’s anticipatory breach of contract claim in Delaware Chancery Court related to pending litigation between Anaptys, GSK, and TESARO, Inc. (“Tesaro”) regarding their Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (“Collaboration Agreement”), which entitles Anaptys to receive royalties upon sales of Jemperli .

As previously disclosed, Anaptys approached Tesaro to engage in good faith discussions to potentially resolve Anaptys’ claims that Tesaro and GSK had breached the Collaboration Agreement. On Nov. 20, 2025, Tesaro, without notice to Anaptys and with discussions ongoing, initiated a lawsuit against Anaptys, claiming that Anaptys had repudiated the Collaboration Agreement and seeking a declaration that Tesaro had not breached.

In response, Anaptys filed its own Complaint in Delaware Chancery Court, requesting a court declaration that Tesaro has materially breached the parties’ Collaboration Agreement and that GSK, Tesaro’s corporate parent, has tortiously interfered with the Collaboration Agreement.

Further, on Dec. 30, 2025, Anaptys filed a Motion to Dismiss Tesaro’s anticipatory breach of contract claim in the same court. The motion, unsealed on Jan. 8, 2026, explains why, as a matter of law, Anaptys has never repudiated the Collaboration Agreement and how Anaptys has only sought to vindicate its contract rights (which cannot be a repudiation). Anaptys’ motion also explains why Delaware’s anti-SLAPP law applies, as the law exists to prevent strategic lawsuits aimed at deterring good‑faith efforts to assert legal rights, such as Tesaro’s lawsuit.

Tesaro and GSK contend that Anaptys’ Motion to Dismiss stays all discovery, a contention that Anaptys strongly opposes as the two companies work toward the scheduled July 14-17 trial date. The court is expected to hear Anaptys’ Motion to Dismiss by early March pursuant to Delaware’s anti-SLAPP law.

About Anaptys’ Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement with Tesaro (an affiliate of GSK)

In March 2014, Anaptys entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Tesaro, an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company now a part of GSK. Currently, under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro is developing Jemperli (dostarlimab) as a monotherapy, and in combination with additional therapies, for various solid tumor indications.

Anaptys is eligible to receive royalties upon sales of Jemperli , equal to 8% of net sales below $1.0 billion, 12% of net sales between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion, 20% of net sales between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion and 25% of net sales above $2.5 billion.

The royalty term under this collaboration extends at least through expiration of composition of matter coverage on the molecule which expires in 2035 in the U.S. and in 2036 in the EU.

About Anaptys

Anaptys is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative immunology therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The company’s pipeline includes rosnilimab, a pathogenic T cell depleter, which has completed a Phase 2b trial for rheumatoid arthritis; ANB033, a CD122 antagonist, in a Phase 1b trial for celiac disease with plans to expand development into an additional indication; and ANB101, a BDCA2 modulator, in a Phase 1a trial.

Kumthekar A, Ogdie A. Obesity and Psoriatic Arthritis: A Narrative Review.","Eli Lilly and Company has announced positive topline results from the TOGETHER-PsA trial, a first-of-its-kind phase 3b study evaluating the concomitant use of the IL-17A inhibitor ixekizumab (Taltz) and the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide (Zepbound) in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who also have obesity or overweight with at least 1 weight-related comorbidity.1 These new results suggest that an integrated pharmacologic approach targeting both inflammatory disease activity and excess body weight can deliver superior clinical outcomes compared with biologic therapy alone.

Background

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease associated with progressive joint damage, functional impairment, and a substantial burden of comorbidities. Obesity is highly prevalent among patients with PsA, affecting an estimated 65% of adults in the United States, and is increasingly recognized as a modifier of disease severity, treatment response, and long-term outcomes.2 Despite guideline recommendations to address obesity in PsA management, weight reduction and inflammatory control are typically treated separately in clinical practice.

Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin-17A, a key cytokine involved in psoriatic inflammation, and is approved for the treatment of PsA, plaque psoriasis, and axial spondyloarthritis. Tirzepatide is the only FDA-approved dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for obesity management and has demonstrated robust and sustained weight loss across multiple clinical programs.

Study Design

TOGETHER-PsA was designed to directly test whether concomitant pharmacologic treatment of obesity could enhance PsA outcomes. The 52-week, randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, open-label study enrolled 271 adult patients with active PsA and a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², or BMI 27–29.9 kg/m² with at least 1 weight-related comorbidity. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous ixekizumab alone or in combination with tirzepatide. All patients received standardized counseling on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, ensuring that observed differences reflected pharmacologic effects.

Results

At the 36-week analysis, the study met its primary endpoint, defined as the proportion of participants achieving both a 50% improvement in PsA disease activity, measured by the American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) response, and at least 10% body weight reduction. In the combination arm, 31.7% of patients met this composite endpoint, compared with only 0.8% of patients treated with ixekizumab monotherapy (p < 0.001).

Key secondary endpoints further supported the superiority of the combination regimen. Notably, 33.5% of patients receiving ixekizumab plus tirzepatide achieved an ACR50 response at week 36, compared with 20.4% in the ixekizumab arm, representing a 64% relative increase in response rate (p < 0.05). This improvement in joint and systemic inflammation occurred in a population with high baseline disease burden, including high disease activity, meaningful functional impairment, and an average BMI of 37.6 kg/m². More than 60% of participants had previously been treated with one or more advanced therapies, underscoring the refractory nature of the study population.

Safety Profile

Safety outcomes in TOGETHER-PsA were consistent with the known profiles of both agents. Adverse events in the combination arm were generally mild to moderate. The most common events occurring in at least 5% of patients included gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation, as well as injection site reactions. In the ixekizumab monotherapy arm, injection site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections were most commonly reported. No new safety signals were identified with concomitant use.

Clinical Implications

From a dermatologic perspective, these findings are particularly relevant, as skin disease and systemic inflammation in psoriatic disease are closely linked to metabolic dysfunction. The findings suggest that obesity may act not only as a comorbidity but also as a modifiable driver of inflammatory disease activity in PsA. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and regulatory discussions are planned.

""While treatment guidelines for psoriatic arthritis recommend management of obesity, the reality is these two chronic diseases are often addressed separately and moving the needle in psoriatic arthritis has remained challenging,"" said Joseph F. Merola, MD, Professor and Chair of the Department of Dermatology and Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Rheumatic Diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center. ""The observed benefit with treatment using Taltz and Zepbound appears to meaningfully impact psoriatic disease activity, indicating that for many patients, PsA is an obesity-related condition. This integrated therapy approach represents a potential paradigm shift and could lead to better outcomes for those living with both diseases.""1

Ensure architecture can ingest new metrics (emissions, safety alerts, etc.)","Regulatory pressure has long shaped the terrain in logistics, from emissions limits, to hours of service (HOS), to safety mandates. Today, that terrain is rapidly changing and the view from the windshield is foggy. Pressure has intensified in recent years, driving innovation across fleet design, yard operations, data systems, and autonomous tooling. At the same time, the industry is navigating politically driven regulatory rollbacks that introduce an additional level of complexity.

Logistics managers have no choice but to adapt. Here are key domains to watch and a strategic playbook for staying ahead of disruption.

Policy: The invisible hand behind innovation

Regulatory and policy incentives have a profound influence on logistics trends and innovations. These forces influence where capital flows, which technologies scale fastest, and which legacy practices persist.

Regulators have long treated transportation and logistics as a focus area for environmental protection and improvement, as these sectors account for a disproportionate share of emissions. In a recent example, the EPA’s “Clean Trucks Plan” set ambitious nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas (GHG) limits for model years 2027-2032 to cut emissions per ton-mile by up to 60%.

Safety targets are likewise tightening and, in turn, shaping capital planning for logistics leaders and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For example, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) recently proposed a rule requiring new vehicles with a gross vehicle weight exceeding 10,000 lb. to be equipped with automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems to reduce the frequency and severity of rear-end collisions.

However, while safety regulations continue to strengthen, environmental rules now face an uncertain future, leaving logistics managers uncertain about their next steps. The current administration is proposing to unravel GHG Phase 3 standards, rescind the Clean Air Act’s endangerment finding (which underpins federal climate regulation), and revoke GHG mandates for light, medium, and heavy vehicles. In parallel, the administration has nullified rules that permitted California’s more stringent emissions regimes, such as the zero-emission Class 8 truck mandates and heavy-duty nitrous oxide rules, citing regulatory overreach. California’s government responded with a lawsuit and orders for new CARB standards.

Though regulatory rollbacks may scale back updates, don’t expect to see a full reversal. For example, OEMs were preparing for 25-40% of new Class 8 trucks to be zero-emission by 2032, and engineering roadmaps are already in motion.

Questions are also emerging around legacy size and weight limits. The long-standing federal weight limit sits at 80,000 pounds, which effectively caps most loads at roughly 45,000 pound of product. Meanwhile, trailers are 53 feet long today, compared to 48 feet a couple of decades ago. Increasing automation could open the door to new configurations: longer, denser, or modular trailer formats designed to optimize payload, aerodynamics, and autonomous system performance. It may not be long before we see regulators revisit size and weight rules to account for safer, more predictable automated driving systems.

A playbook for navigating uncertainty

Despite uncertainty, the upshot of a softening of enforcement intensity is that fleets may gain some breathing room in capital planning. In the near term, these rollbacks alleviate pressure on fleets that were bracing for a pre-2027 buying surge, formerly anticipated due to strict emissions deadlines. That surge may no longer materialize, bursting a distorting bubble in truck orders.

However, fleet managers cannot defer safety investments, such as collision-avoidance systems, telematics, and driver-assist technology. The dual dynamic of emissions flexibility and safety expectations will require planning agility.

Expect to see gradual, targeted deployment of improvements rather than wholesale fleet conversion. Leading operators will build simulations of their logistics networks, monitoring route shifts, demand disruptions, energy constraints, and new policy regimes. Electric vehicles will gain traction in yards, regional lanes, and controlled operations where charging can be assured. Advanced driver-assistance systems will continue to proliferate, with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance, and driver monitoring expanding in high-risk corridors.

Given the push-pull of market, investor, and regulatory forces, how can logistics leaders navigate the bumpy road ahead? Here’s a strategic roadmap to follow:

● Conduct policy scenario planning. Build alternate futures based on tight, relaxed, or mixed regulations, and stress test investment plans against each.

● Invest in data abstraction. Ensure architecture can ingest new metrics (emissions, safety alerts, etc.) for fast pivots if regulatory targets shift.

● Choose modular deployment. Begin with low-regret zones (yards, regional loops, high-density nodes) before scaling to full long-haul conversions.

● Forge industry-regulator engagement. Participate in rulemaking, industry coalitions, or pilot programs so that insights influence realistic standards rather than reactive mandates.

● Protect optionality in fleets. When buying powertrains or vehicles, favor architectures that can be retrofitted or upgraded, not locked into a single technology bet.

● Play the long game. Delaying emissions investments risks stranded assets when standards inevitably rebound.

● Work with your partners. Whether technology, service or consultants, work closely with your partners on what trends, best practices and investments that others are making.

Innovation by design, not by force

Logistics innovation over the next decade will not be a linear march toward a cleaner, safer future; it will be steered by the winds of policy, regulation, and leaders investing in change. Safety regulations are holding strong, requiring immediate attention and investment, while environmental rollbacks may provide a moment of reprieve before kicking back into gear.

Throughout uncertainty, logistics leaders must treat policy as an inspiration for design, not merely a compliance overlay. Resilient platforms, modular capabilities, and intelligent systems will thrive under shifting rules.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/annika-adobestock-589591429.53bB1XEbQs.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-08 19:03:11.541760

New dietary guidelines

It's being touted as ""the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in decades."" Under the direction of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Trump administration has released new dietary guidelines for Americans, looking to address the escalating health costs stemming from chronic illness and the highest level of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in the developed world. The 10-page report is in sharp contrast to the previous 164-page report in not just size, but also revises some past notable recommendations.

Snapshot: The new inverted pyramid is based on protein, dairy, and vegetables and fruits, with whole grains taking a smaller portion of the diagram. Healthy fats are also encouraged, including omega-3-rich seafood, nuts, and avocados, as well as full-fat dairy over low-fat options, and foods to promote ""gut health"" like kimchi and kefir. It additionally takes aim at processed foods and refined carbohydrates, while removing specific daily limits on alcohol, and instead encouraged Americans to ""consume less alcohol for better overall health.""

Meanwhile, war was declared on the sweet stuff. ""No amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is recommended or considered part of a healthy or nutritious diet,"" according to the HHS, which called on parents to completely avoid added sugar for children four years old and younger. While the Sugar Association applauded HHS’s recommendation to limit sugar intake, they objected to how the report overstates and extrapolates the actual science, studying just the relationship between sugar-sweetened beverages and various health outcomes.

Elsewhere: The response from the food industry was predictable, as the American Beverage Association – whose members include Coca-Cola Company (KO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) – argued that ""Americans deserve pragmatic advice they can use in daily life"" and that the new guidance ""dismisses safe, effective no sugar options, is impractical, and inherently contradictory."" The news weighed slightly on companies whose revenue relies heavily on processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Shares of Hormel (HRL), Conagra Brands (CAG), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and Mondelez (MDLZ) were all trading defensively following the press conference. (52 comments)

Utrecht, The Netherlands-based ViCentra initially closed its Series D in September, bringing in $85 million. The now-closed extension to the financing brings the total raised to $98 million. CEO Tom Arnold explained the company’s plans for a big commercial push with the funds in an interview with Drug Delivery Business News after the initial closing.

ViCentra said the additional funding follows “a strong year of commercial and operational progress.” It includes new capital from ROM Utrecht Region and a consortium of Dutch investors, including Venturing Tech. Existing investor Innovation Industries also took part in the second closing.

The company intends to use funds to scale manufacturing and deepen execution in Germany, the Netherlands and France. It also hopes to accelerate preparations to bring its next-generation Kaleido insulin patch pump to the U.S. market. The company hopes to enter a hot patch pump market, led by Insulet, with potential competitors, like Medtronic/MiniMed, Beta Bionics and Tandem Diabetes Care, are developing their own patch pumps. PharmaSens and SiBionics also recently unveiled their own entry, an all-in-one device, too.

Kaleido, described by the company as the smallest, lightest and most precise insulin patch pump in its class, offers premium materials and customizable aluminum shells in 10 color options to deliver the feel of personal technology rather than a traditional medical device. It integrates with Diabeloop’s self-learning automated insulin delivery algorithm and Dexcom’s leading continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).

“The past year has been transformative for ViCentra,” Arnold said in a news release. “This latest funding enables us to further scale our manufacturing capabilities, strengthen our commercial presence and support in Germany, the Netherlands, and France, and ensures that we remain on course for our planned U.S. market access. Our goal for 2026 is clear: convert our current high demand into satisfied users through uncompromising quality and performance and nearly triple our European user base by the end of 2026.”",https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ViCentra-Kaleido-Blue-worn-on-arm.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 16:01:55.683678

The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.

Convogo’s product will be wound down.

The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.

In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes.

“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”

Here are some innovative uses of CRISPR in agriculture:

Enhanced Fungi for Meat Alternatives

One of the most notable innovative uses of CRISPR in agriculture is the development of genetically engineered fungi that can serve as a sustainable and nutritious meat alternative.

Improved Digestibility and Production Efficiency: Researchers have used CRISPR to modify fungi, making them easier to digest and less resource-intensive to produce. ""Using CRISPR, researchers made a protein packed fungi that’s easier to stomach. The genetically engineered fungus that tastes like meat and could have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional livestock or even “lab-grown” cell-cultured meat.""

Specific Modifications: Scientists from Jiangnan University in China tweaked the DNA of Fusarium venenatum, a fungus already used as a meat alternative, to enhance its nutritional profile and reduce production costs. ""Using CRISPR gene editing technology, researchers from Jiangnan University in China took a fungus that is already used as a meat alternative (Fusarium venenatum) and tweaked its DNA to make it easier to digest and less resource-intensive to produce.""

Environmental and Economic Benefits: This gene-edited fungi requires significantly less sugar to produce the same amount of protein and produces protein much faster than its non-altered counterpart. It also has a smaller environmental footprint compared to traditional livestock. ""This new, edited DNA strain required 44 percent less sugar to produce the same amount of protein as a non-genetically altered strain. It was also able to produce protein 88 percent faster than the original version.""

General Applications in Agriculture

CRISPR is also being explored for broader applications in agriculture to improve crop resilience and yield.

Crop Improvement: CRISPR can be used to develop crops that are more resistant to diseases, pests, and harsh environmental conditions, leading to increased yields and reduced need for pesticides. ""Scientists find applications of CRISPR in Agriculture""

Accessibility for Research: The relative ease and affordability of CRISPR kits make it accessible for researchers and even biohackers to experiment with genetic modifications, potentially leading to more innovative agricultural solutions. ""Assuming you have the target transgene or knockout mapped and your guide snippet, they have kits that cost about 500 bucks and only require basic lab equipment to use. They are easy enough to use that if you can follow a cookbook recipe you could crispr something.""

Future Potential

The potential for CRISPR in agriculture is vast, with ongoing research exploring new ways to enhance food production and sustainability.

Addressing Food Demands: Gene-edited foods like the fungi meat alternative can help meet the growing global food demands without the high environmental costs associated with traditional farming. ""Gene-edited foods like this can meet growing food demands without the environmental costs of conventional farming.""

Nutritional Enhancements: CRISPR can be used to improve the nutritional content of crops, such as increasing vitamin levels or protein content. ""the amino acid score and availability is pretty good. i'd eat this if its economically viable to animal proteins.""

More than 230 million people globally ask health and wellness-related questions on ChatGPT every week, a pattern OpenAI says has been playing out for some time.

Now, it is formalizing that behavior with the launch of ChatGPT Health, which allows users to connect medical records and wellness apps to unify their data and better inform their health-related conversations.

Early integrations span fitness and nutrition platforms, such as Apple Health for movement, sleep and activity data, Function for lab test insights and nutrition guidance and MyFitnessPal for macros and recipes. Weight Watchers is also integrated, with a focus on GLP-1-related meal planning and food guidance.

Additional launch partners include Peloton for suggested workout classes or guided meditations, Instacart for turning meal plans into shoppable grocery lists and AllTrails for activity discovery.

Peloton said the integration gives members a level of personalization that was previously out of reach, allowing ChatGPT Health to make more tailored class recommendations based on medical context, such as injury recovery plans from a doctor or adjusting fitness focus based on cholesterol trends and recent Peloton output.

The partnership, Peloton added, builds on the launch of Peloton IQ, its newer on-device AI coaching system.

In a post announcing the new experience, OpenAI said ChatGPT Health was developed with input from more than 260 physicians and is designed to help users understand health trends and prepare for medical appointments, rather than replace professional care. Notably, medical record integrations and some app connections are U.S.-only for now.

The company also addressed what is likely to be a top concern: how health data is handled.

“Conversations and files across ChatGPT are encrypted by default at rest and in transit as part of our core security architecture,” OpenAI noted. “Due to the sensitive nature of health data, Health builds on this foundation with additional, layered protections — including purpose-built encryption and isolation—to keep health conversations protected and compartmentalized. Conversations in Health are not used to train our foundation models.”

Users can also add an additional layer of security by enabling multi-factor authentication.

OpenAI has opened a waitlist for ChatGPT Health and is starting with a small group of early users to refine the experience before expanding access more broadly in the coming weeks.

From a wider perspective, the launch comes as AI is quickly becoming unavoidable across the fitness industry.

As project definition advanced and market conditions improved, the mandate was increased to up to US$1 billion in November 2025 (see November 19, 2025 press release).","January 8, 2026, Montreal, Quebec – Troilus Mining Corp. (TSX: TLG; OTCQX: CHXMF; FRA: CM5) (“Troilus” or the “Company”), is pleased to provide a review of its key accomplishments in 2025 and an outlook for 2026, as the Company advances its flagship Troilus copper-gold project (the “Project”) through critical development milestones and positions it for the next phase of execution, in this open letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer, Justin Reid.

To our valued shareholders and stakeholders,

As we reflect on 2025, it is clear that the Troilus Team achieved major technical, regulatory, organizational, and financing milestones required to advance the Project into its next phase of development, while substantially increasing shareholder value, with the Company’s share price increasing by approximately 432% over the year. This progress has established a strong foundation as we enter 2026—a transition year focused on advancing detailed engineering, permitting and financing in preparation for construction.

Throughout the year, we advanced across all critical development streams in parallel. We completed basic engineering and transitioned into detailed engineering, submitted our Environmental and Social Impact Assessment at both the federal and provincial levels, and further improved geological confidence of mineral resources through targeted drilling. At the same time, we strengthened the organization with key additions to our leadership and operational teams and continued to modernize internal systems to support the transition from project development to execution.

Outstanding market performance over the year reflected the impact of this operational delivery and continued investor confidence in the quality and scale of the Troilus Project. Importantly, this performance was underpinned by tangible progress on the ground and increasing project readiness, rather than macro conditions alone.

We were pleased to see Troilus continue to be recognized as a project of strategic importance within the broader critical minerals ecosystem. Our inclusion as a corporate delegate on the Canadian government’s critical-minerals trade missions to Germany and to Japan and South Korea reflect growing global interest in the Project and its alignment with secure, long-term supply-chain priorities.

Separately, in recognition of the breadth of progress and execution achieved across all aspects of the Project throughout the year, we were honoured to receive the Québec Mineral Exploration Association’s Entrepreneur of the Year award in late October (see October 30,2025 press release).

With the key gating items of the development pathway now well advanced, Troilus enters 2026 focused on disciplined execution. The coming year is expected to mark a transition from planning to early construction readiness, as we continue to advance and de-risk the Project.

2025 Key Accomplishments:

Technical and Project De-Risking

Technical progress remained the primary focus throughout 2025. During the year, Troilus maintained schedule discipline, completing basic engineering and transitioning into detailed engineering under the direction of BBA Inc (see January 28, June 10, and October 15, 2025 press releases). Major engineering deliverables – including process flowsheet definition, capital cost estimation, procurement planning, and project execution planning – were substantially advanced, with all key requests for quotations issued and technical and commercial evaluations of major equipment and construction packages well progressed. This work materially strengthens project definition and supports construction readiness by underpinning permitting, financing, and advanced exploration.

In parallel, Troilus submitted its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) to both federal and provincial authorities, marking one of the most significant gating items for the Project (see June 25, 2025 press release). The submission met internal targets, and the review process is well advanced, with federal approval currently targeted for the second half of 2026 and provincial approval to follow. Ongoing engagement with regulators, stakeholders and Indigenous rightsholders continue as part of this process.

The Company also completed approximately 13,300 metres of drilling during the year, most of which focused on delineating and extending high-grade trends to further improve geological confidence, upgrading resources to indicated and measured categories (see February 4, May 22, June 17, 2025 press releases).

Building a Construction-Ready Organization

With key technical milestones achieved, Troilus continued to build the organizational capacity required for the next phase of development.

Throughout 2025, the Company made several targeted senior appointments across Project leadership, construction, processing, health and safety, and operational readiness, aligning the organization with the evolving needs of the Project as it advances toward execution. Several new members of the operational team have committed to a Chibougamau-based presence, further supporting local integration and readiness.

Health and safety remained a core priority. Troilus achieved zero lost-time incidents during calendar 2025 and made meaningful progress in implementing a modern health and safety framework aligned with best practices within the Québec mining sector. Enhanced data collection, proactive risk analysis, and preventative systems have been put in place, supported by the recent addition of a dedicated Health and Safety Superintendent. These efforts will continue in 2026 to ensure that health and safety are a top priority at the Troilus site as we prepare for increased activity and an influx of new workers.

Internally, Troilus also advanced work to modernize and strengthen its operating systems and corporate infrastructure. Preparatory work was undertaken to support the implementation of upgraded enterprise and operational systems in 2026, ensuring scalability, transparency, and operational discipline as the Company transitions toward construction and operations.

Financing and Commercial Progress

Advancing a generational copper-gold operation producing more than 300,000 gold-equivalent ounces per year requires a comprehensive and resilient financing strategy. Following the release of the Troilus Project Feasibility Study in May 2024 (see May 14, 2024 press release), the Company made it a priority to establish a funding framework capable of supporting construction while maintaining flexibility through development.

By late 2024, Troilus had secured indicative expressions of interest (“LOIs”) totaling approximately US$1.3 billion from a group of leading global export credit agencies (“ECAs”), providing the foundation for a structured project financing process (see November 13, November 19 and November 21, 2024 press releases).

In March 2025, Troilus mandated a syndicate of global financial institutions, led by Société Générale, KfW IPEX-Bank, and Export Development Canada, to arrange a senior project debt facility of up to US$700 million (see March 13, 2025 press release). As project definition advanced and market conditions improved, the mandate was increased to up to US$1 billion in November 2025 (see November 19, 2025 press release). Comprehensive technical, financial, and environmental and social due diligence has been underway since early 2025 and will continue in 2026 to underpin the finalization of the debt package.

Commercial arrangements progressed in parallel and are integrated into the debt financing framework. During 2025, Troilus negotiated preliminary indicative long-term offtake terms with Aurubis AG and Boliden Commercial AB, two of Europe’s leading copper smelters, covering a significant portion of the Project’s anticipated copper-gold concentrate production and reflecting strong demand for high-quality, responsibly sourced copper (see June 18, July 10, and August 26, 2025 press releases). In parallel, discussions with potential Canadian smelters are ongoing, with the expectation that a portion of future concentrate production will be processed domestically to support local supply chains. These arrangements are expected to be finalized in 2026.

In November 2025, the Company strengthened its balance sheet through a CDN$172.5 million bought-deal public offering, representing the second-largest common share offering by a Québec-headquartered company in over a decade and the second-largest TSX issuer financing completed in 2025 (see November 14, 2025 press release). The financing further expanded Troilus’ institutional shareholder base, including the participation of new major global funds.

Looking ahead, the senior debt facility is expected to form the cornerstone of a fully funded construction package, complemented by additional financing instruments under evaluation, with the objective of delivering a balanced and flexible financing solution in 2026.

A 2022 S&P report pegged copper demand even higher, reaching above 50 million tons annually by 2040, but that was based on a “net zero” scenario in which renewable energy and EV use expand faster than they currently are.
And it’s clear that an integrated global market is necessary for sufficient copper to get to where it is most needed.
Saudi Arabia is also rapidly building out its copper refining capacity.
So for copper, the only path forward is through trade.","Copper is a conflict mineral of the future, an indispensable building block for critical technologies that has long been taken for granted but that will play an increasingly central role in US trade relations with China and Latin America—where most of the world’s copper production and processing capacity are located. The S&P study stresses that copper can’t be obtained at the necessary volumes or timelines through recycling or new mining alone. A 2022 S&P report pegged copper demand even higher, reaching above 50 million tons annually by 2040, but that was based on a “net zero” scenario in which renewable energy and EV use expand faster than they currently are. Even under the current pace of adoption, copper demand will still likely grow at least 1 million tons per year up to 2040, the new report found. Filling that need is a diplomatic challenge at least as much as an engineering one, with critical steps of the supply chain spread around the globe.

US President Donald Trump’s recent escalation in saber-rattling toward mineral-rich Greenland — whose deposits of copper are likely significant but remain underexplored — shows the administration’s willingness to exercise force to expand US access to raw materials. But taking minerals by force may close off access to other pieces of the supply puzzle by further ratcheting up protectionism on the part of other powers.

And it’s clear that an integrated global market is necessary for sufficient copper to get to where it is most needed. The US urgently needs to catch up to China on copper processing capability, which invading Greenland won’t help address: The US has only two functioning smelters, while China has dozens (which help to keep their costs low through the use of cheap renewable electricity, as well as plentiful supplies of heavily polluting coal). Saudi Arabia is also rapidly building out its copper refining capacity.

So for copper, the only path forward is through trade. “If we think it will be solved for the US by investment in the US, we’re never going to get there,” said Carlos Pascual, S&P Global’s senior vice president for geopolitics and international affairs.","https://img.semafor.com/4b0b93be598680a19e42ba37a19e4e0e87b97019-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2026-01-08 13:14:43.479391

Tezos, a self-amending blockchain platform, is gaining attention for its potential price trajectory through 2030, driven by its technological advancements and market positioning. Since its 2018 launch, Tezos has been recognized for its proof-of-stake consensus, on-chain governance, and formal verification capabilities, which allow protocol upgrades without hard forks. In 2024, Tezos processed over 50 million transactions, maintaining energy efficiency significantly higher than proof-of-work networks. The platform's total value locked in decentralized applications reached $150 million by late 2024, marking a 300% year-over-year growth. Institutional adoption is also on the rise, with entities like Société Générale utilizing Tezos for digital asset securities. Analysts predict that upcoming platform upgrades, such as enhanced Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, could further boost developer accessibility and price appreciation. Additionally, regulatory clarity and the growing tokenization of real-world assets are expected to support Tezos's market expansion. Long-term projections for Tezos through 2030 consider its established presence in digital art, gaming, and regulated finance. As enterprise blockchain adoption becomes mainstream, Tezos's unique governance model and energy efficiency may offer competitive advantages. However, the platform faces challenges from intense competition and macroeconomic factors, which could impact its valuation. Investors are advised to monitor network activity, developer growth, and partnerships to assess Tezos's potential for significant market expansion.

Ventyx’s pipeline features small molecule therapeutics, including NLRP3 inhibitors, designed to target inflammation across a spectrum of diseases with high unmet medical needs. These include cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The company’s clinical-stage programs aim to deliver improved efficacy and safety compared to existing treatments.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” said Daniel Skovronsky, chief scientific and product officer at Lilly. “Ventyx’s pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options and strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients across cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity.”

The acquisition terms include a purchase price of $14.00 per share, representing a 62% premium to Ventyx’s 30-day volume-weighted average trading price as of January 5, 2026. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and is subject to regulatory approvals and Ventyx stockholder consent. Entities affiliated with New Science Ventures and Ventyx’s directors and officers (representing approximately 10% of the company’s outstanding shares) have already signed voting and support agreements.

Raju Mohan, CEO of Ventyx, echoed Skovronsky’s sentiment through highlighting the potential of their NLRP3 inhibitors to address residual and chronic inflammation, which is now recognized as a major risk factor in neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic, and cardiovascular diseases. “Lilly’s resources and commitment to innovative oral drugs make them an ideal partner to advance our therapies and address vast unmet needs,” he said.

This acquisition builds on Lilly’s presence in inflammatory-mediated diseases. In January 2020, the firm shelled out $1.1 billion to purchase Dermira. The acquisition added lebrikizumab lebrikizumab, an IL-13 inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, to Lilly's portfolio. It also included Qbrexza, a treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating).

“American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods — protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats and whole grains — and dramatically reduce highly processed foods.
Whole grains The previous Dietary Guidelines recommended three servings of whole grains and three servings of refined grains daily.
The website placed much of the blame on processed foods.
“The new Dietary Guidelines send a clear and powerful message to Americans: Dairy foods belong at the center of a healthy diet,” said Michael Dykes, DVM, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association.","WASHINGTON — The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025-2030 released Jan. 7 upended several recommendations from a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) and flipped the old food pyramid upside down.

Unlike the previous pyramid, which was replaced by MyPlate over a decade ago, the new pyramid places the food that should be consumed the most at its flat top: nutrient-dense protein from animal and plant sources; healthy fats from whole foods such as eggs, seafood, meats, full-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, olives and avocados; and vegetables and fruit.

The new pyramid has whole grains at the pointy bottom, promoting two to four servings a day, and it leaves out refined grains entirely. In the old pyramid, bread, cereal, rice and pasta were at the bottom base, with recommendations of 6 to 11 servings per day.

“These Guidelines return us to the basics,” said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods — protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats and whole grains — and dramatically reduce highly processed foods. This is how we make America healthy again.”

The HHS and the US Department of Agriculture update the Dietary Guidelines every five years.

Whole grains

The previous Dietary Guidelines recommended three servings of whole grains and three servings of refined grains daily. The new Dietary Guidelines recommend that consumers should prioritize fiber-rich whole grains and reduce consumption of highly processed carbohydrates.

“The updated Guidelines place an emphasis on whole grains, which aligns with long-standing public health goals,” said Erin Ball, executive director of the Grain Foods Foundation. “However, the Guidelines de-emphasize grains overall, and the guidance does not recommend refined and enriched grain foods — thus ignoring their role in nutrient delivery, affordability and how baked goods function in everyday eating patterns.”

Fifty percent of Americans have prediabetes or diabetes, 75% of adults report having at least one chronic disease, and 90% of US health care spending goes to treating chronic disease, according to realfood.gov. The website placed much of the blame on processed foods.

“For the first time, we’re calling out the dangers of highly processed foods and rebuilding a broken system from the ground up with gold-standard science and common sense,” the website said.

Going against the DGAC

Normally, the Dietary Guidelines take the findings of the DGAC into account. This time the administration of President Donald Trump did a supplemental scientific analysis of the 2025 DGAC report, which was finished during the Biden administration. The analysis found that the DGAC advocated plant-based dietary patterns, deprioritized animal-sourced proteins and favored high-linoleic acid vegetable oils.

The new Dietary Guidelines do not implement several DGAC recommendations, including emphasizing the intake of beans, peas and lentils while reducing intakes of red and processed meats, and emphasizing consumption of low-fat or non-fat dairy and unsaturated fats.

“The new Dietary Guidelines send a clear and powerful message to Americans: Dairy foods belong at the center of a healthy diet,” said Michael Dykes, DVM, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “IDFA applauds HHS and USDA for grounding the 2025–2030 DGA in today’s nutrition science, including the evidence showing that dairy products at all fat levels support healthy eating patterns.”

The new Dietary Guidelines will “partially” implement the DGAC report’s recommendation to limit foods and beverages higher in saturated fat and to limit total saturated fat intake to less than 10% of calories per day, starting at age 2, by replacing it with unsaturated fat, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acid.

The new Dietary Guidelines also implement several other DGAC recommendations, including limiting foods high in added sugars and emphasizing intakes of iron, folate/folic acid, iodine and chlorine among pregnant and postpartum individuals. The new pyramid encourages avoiding added sugars entirely, especially for children, while allowing naturally occurring sugars found in whole fruits and plain dairy.

“The administration pledged the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans would deliver fresh, simple, comprehensive, science-based guidance,” said Courtney Gaine, PhD, president and CEO of The Sugar Association. “Instead, the 500 pages of new materials released today reflect outdated rhetoric about added sugars that are anything but simple and are inconsistent, unrealistic and lacking scientific support. These Guidelines and accompanying rhetoric will not make Americans any healthier. In fact, added sugars intake has already plummeted 30% over the past two decades, while obesity has spiked by 40%.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2026/01/08/1767889620885-ebb4cf97-5482-4f25-b1f7-c58e13b939f4_1.jpg?height=635&t=1767889960&width=1200,N,,2026-01-08 15:02:25.901201

In October, Ventyx reported preliminary data from a Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with cardiovascular risk and obesity.
This study included a cohort that evaluated the study drug alongside Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 weight loss drug, Wegovy.
Beyond NLRP3, Ventyx has compounds in mid-stage clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease: the S1P1R modulator tamuzimod and the TYK2 inhibitor VTX958.
Novo’s pipeline lists an NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 1 development for the fatty liver disease MASH and cardiovascular disease.","Eli Lilly is building its prospects in immunology through the $1.2 billion acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences, a clinical-stage company with drugs addressing a promising target offering the potential to treat a range of inflammatory disorders.

The deal announced after Wednesday’s market close follows Ventyx’s fall release of mid-stage data for lead program VTX3232, a drug in development for treating inflammation that contributes to cardiovascular disease. That data readout triggered discussions with Sanofi, whose prior investment in Ventyx gave it the right of first negotiation on the program. But Lilly won out with a deal to buy the entire company.

Ventyx develops oral small molecule drugs for inflammatory disorders. In recent years, the San Diego-based biotech honed its R&D focus to drugs that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex that regulates inflammatory signaling. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that target NLRP3.

In October, Ventyx reported preliminary data from a Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with cardiovascular risk and obesity. The readout showed treatment with VTX3232 reduced levels of a liver protein associated with inflammation along with reductions in a range of biological measures indicative of cardiovascular risk. The drug was safe and well tolerated. But VTX3232 does not appear to have a future as an obesity drug. This study included a cohort that evaluated the study drug alongside Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 weight loss drug, Wegovy. Results showed VTX3232 did not lead to weight loss as a monotherapy or in addition to Wegovy.

The cardiovascular results followed the summer release of encouraging data from a separate Phase 2 test of VTX3232 in Parkinson’s disease. In this indication, Ventyx is leveraging the brain-penetrating properties of the molecule as a way to treat the neurodegenerative disorder.

The Ventyx pipeline also includes VTX2735, a peripherally restricted NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 2 testing for recurrent pericarditis. Beyond NLRP3, Ventyx has compounds in mid-stage clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease: the S1P1R modulator tamuzimod and the TYK2 inhibitor VTX958. Lilly sees broad potential applications for Ventyx’s drugs.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific and product officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said in a prepared statement. “Ventyx’s clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.”

Lilly’s main metabolic medicines rival, Novo Nordisk, has an NLRP3 inhibitor licensed from startup Ventus Therapeutics. Novo’s pipeline lists an NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 1 development for the fatty liver disease MASH and cardiovascular disease. Roche also has a clinical-stage NLRP3 inhibitors in its pipeline. Other companies with NLRP3 inhibitors include BioAge Labs and startup Nodthera.

The financial terms of the acquisition agreement call for Lilly to pay $14 in cash for each share of Ventyx, an approximately 62% premium to the stock’s average trading price in the 30 days leading up to Jan. 5. Shares of Ventyx spiked earlier this week after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Lilly was close to striking a deal for the biotech.

The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction, which still requires approvals from Ventyx stockholders and regulators. Lilly expects to close the acquisition in the first half of this year.

(ACI) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 5.7% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.

We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.

Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.

So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefiting from the inevitable rebound.

However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.

Here's Why ACI Could Experience a Turnaround

The heavy selling of ACI shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 24.44. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.

The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ACI has increased 0.5%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.

Moreover, ACI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .

Parabilis’ financing is the largest disclosed in early January.
The result was what is now the Helicon platform, which Parabilis says it can use to reach multiple critical targets previously considered undruggable.","Dive Brief:

Parabilis Medicines, formerly known as FogPharma, raised $305 million in a Series F financing to support its mission of pursuing disease targets long dismissed as out of reach by modern science.

RA Capital Management, Fidelity Management and Janus Henderson Investors led the latest round of financing, which included both old and new investors, Parabilis said Thursday. The Series F gave the company a higher valuation than the previous round, which pulled in $145 million in early 2024.

The company plans to use the funds to advance its lead drug candidate, zolucatetide, which is designed to target a beta-catenin pathway connected to millions of cancer cases. The experimental therapy has shown “compelling preliminary data” in an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, Parabilis said.

Dive Insight:

Parabilis is riding a wave of resurgent enthusiasm for venture capital funding in the industry. A downturn after the pandemic dramatically slowed the pace of new public offerings and left private companies struggling for cash. Trump administration policies that gutted scientific funding, introduced turmoil into regulatory agencies and threatened tariffs on the industry made the situation worse.

But the second half of 2025 saw a turnaround for biopharma. Venture capital funding rebounded as concerns about tariffs lessened, key drug launches beat expectations and a flurry of acquisitions demonstrated faith in smaller biotechs. IPOs may be poised to bounce back as well, with Aktis Oncology set to be the first to test the waters this year.

The funding round announced by Parabilis comes amid similar recent announcements from Soley Therapeutics, Diagonal Therapeutics, EpiBiologics and Beacon Therapeutics, among others. Parabilis’ financing is the largest disclosed in early January.

Parabilis has long had a high profile for a cancer medicine startup. The company’s Helicon technology is based on work done by co-founder Greg Verdine and his team in a laboratory at Harvard University starting in the late 1990s. Verdine has since become a serial biotech entrepreneur.

At Harvard, Verdine’s team set out to overcome the problem that traditional drugs have in reaching and binding to disease-causing proteins inside a cell. They developed short peptides in a specific helix shape that could enter cells and block disease targets.

Walmart appointed the former CEO of Grammarly (now Superhuman) Shishir Mehrotra to its board of directors, according to a Thursday press release.

Mehrotra will serve on the board’s technology and e-commerce committee, as well as its compensation and management development committee.

He brings over 25 years of technology experience to the appointment, including co-founding an AI platform and serving as YouTube’s chief product officer and chief technology officer.

Dive Insight:

Mehrotra’s tech background ties into Walmart’s larger efforts to adopt AI across the business.

“I have long admired Walmart’s ability to innovate while staying true to its core values, and joining the Board as the company builds for an agentic AI future is a rare opportunity,” Mehrotra said in a statement. “This era is the most significant technological shift I’ve seen in my career, and I look forward to working with the team to shape the future for the millions of people Walmart serves.”

The mass retailer announced a slew of AI-related tools and initiatives in 2025.

Walmart in July debuted a new AI framework for the entire business that centers around four “super agents” and unifies its approach to the technology, aiming to avoid fragmented innovation across the company. Since then, Walmart has expressed confidence in its customer-facing AI agent Sparky becoming more important for shoppers and also launched new tools for marketplace sellers.

The company has also inked a deal with AI powerhouse OpenAI to create custom certification trainings for employees and started selling through ChatGPT’s Instant Checkout shopping feature.

Mehrotra’s appointment comes a few weeks before Walmart veteran John Furner is set to take over the CEO position from Doug McMillon. When Furner’s appointment was announced in November, the emergence of artificial intelligence in retail was specifically mentioned by McMillon.

“He’s uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation,” McMillon said in a statement at the time. “He’s a merchant, an operator, an innovator, and a builder.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/R9RgNAwK9r8pSjQk9DFiJ9sF-QCaEOt7Ul3ooHfVo9I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9XYWxtYXJ0X0dlcm1hbnRvd25fTWFyeWxhbmRfMDYwOTI1LTEuSlBH.webp,N,,2026-01-08 12:15:03.433476

The brands said a merger would allow them to better compete against growing rivals in the grocery industry, like Walmart and Costco, and would preserve customer choice.

However, the $24.6 billion deal was met with backlash as the federal government argued it would “almost certainly” benefit shareholders and not the people who visit the stores daily.

Under the deal, the two grocery chains would sell 579 locations in places where their stores overlap to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a supplier to independent supermarkets.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urged the judge in the case to temporarily prevent the merger in September 2024, as the commission previously worried the merger would lead to higher food prices for consumers and eliminate competition.

“It’s this local competition, in these local communities, that this merger will eliminate,” Susan Musser, the FTC’s chief trial counsel said, adding that Albertsons and Kroger compete with one another rather than places like Amazon or Costco where consumers partake in other kinds of shopping.

Johnson & Johnson has announced the submission of its Ottava Robotic Surgical System for De Novo classification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Ottava system encompasses surgical instrumentation and will, in future, be connected to the Polyphonic digital ecosystem. It is intended to address unmet need for surgeons.The De Novo classification request – De Novo classification is designed for new, low-to-moderate-risk medical devices – centres on an indication for Ottava that covers upper abdomen surgery, including gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, small bowel resection and hiatal hernia repair.

The submission is based on data from the Ottava Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, filed data used to show Ottava’s safety and effectiveness. Initial cases were completed at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Centre by Dr Erik Wilson, chief of minimally invasive and elective general surgery at University of Texas Health (UT Health) Houston and lead study investigator.

“The IDE study builds on a significant body of preclinical evidence we have generated demonstrating the impact of the Ottava system, and provides critical clinical evidence on the system performance,” said Peter Schulam, chief scientific officer, MedTech at Johnson & Johnson.

Additionally, Johnson & Johnson received IDE approval in late 2025 for the initiation of a US clinical trial of Ottava in inguinal hernia procedures. This is one of the US’ most commonly-performed surgeries.

Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.
Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed.
Instead of treating each smart bulb as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light.
Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users.","What you need to know

Unlike old scenes that assigned colors at random, Hue SpatialAware uses an algorithm to map your room so lights work together.

You scan your room with your phone, the Hue app builds a spatial model, and an algorithm orchestrates the scene automatically.

About half of Hue’s Scene Gallery supports SpatialAware at launch, including Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.

Until now, Hue scenes looked nice, but didn’t really understand your room. Colors were assigned to lights without knowing their actual spots. For example, a lamp behind your couch might shine as brightly as a ceiling light across the room, which could ruin the effect Hue wanted. Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.

Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed. Instead of treating each smart bulb as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light. It then spreads colors and brightness in a way that copies how light works in real life.

The Hue app uses augmented reality and asks you to scan your room with your phone or tablet. This scan builds a model that shows where each light is, including floor lamps, wall lights, and ceiling fixtures. After that, an algorithm takes over and arranges scenes so every light fits in naturally.

If you add new lights later, just scan the area again and the room model updates on its own.

Nature scenes get the biggest upgrade

The most noticeable upgrade is in Hue’s nature-inspired scenes. About half of the updated Scene Gallery will work with SpatialAware at launch, including options like Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.

In practice, if you choose a sunset-style scene, lights on one side of the room glow with warm yellows, while lights across the room turn deeper and darker. You can still use the classic scene mode if you want, but after seeing SpatialAware, the difference is clear.

Philips Hue says the feature is built for Bridge Pro users, framing it as a premium experience that leans heavily on smarter processing and room awareness.

Bridge Pro is also becoming more flexible. Now, users can combine several Bridges into one Bridge Pro setup, with the only limit being the hardware’s capacity.

Hue’s AI assistant is also getting better. Now, you can ask it to create automations using natural language, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. It’s also adding more language support and learning how to guide users to the right troubleshooting help when problems come up.

Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users. Most of the other upgrades will arrive between now and the first quarter of 2026.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4y4JJNKP4ijz9rWNSc3jrC-1920-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:03:48.551717

This is the conclusion of an analysis by wine market analyst Del Rey AWM based on market data from S&P Global.

In principle, the figures initially show that French wine exports were in decline during the first nine months of 2025. Between January and September, exports decreased by 2.5% in value and 1.8% in volume, while average prices fell slightly to €8.71 per liter (-0.7%). In absolute figures, this means an export of 9.4m hectoliters of wine worth €8.2bn for this period.

Sparkling wine prices reduced

A breakdown by category shows a mixed picture: sparkling wine exports, particularly Champagne, actually increased (+4.1%) to 148m liters. However, this growth was accompanied by a reversal of the previous year's price increases: average prices fell by 6.2% to €19.58 per liter, which led to a revenue decrease of 2.3% to €2.9bn.

For bottled still wines, prices remained relatively stable at €7.68 per liter, but exports declined in both volume (–3.2%) and value (–2.9% to just over €5bn). The bulk wine category, which is less significant for French wine exports, lost 2.1% in volume. However, prices that were 8.5% higher led to a revenue increase of 6.2% (totaling €140m).

If the value losses of French wine exports are differentiated regionally, it becomes clear that a good third of the deficit was caused by the lack of demand for Bordeaux wines: €50.3m of the total €152.9m decline in revenue for bottled still wines is attributable to Bordeaux. Languedoc also suffered a sharp drop in value of €25.9m (–22.7%). Overall, AOP wines were significantly more affected by the decline than IGP wines: €140m of the decline in turnover for non-sparkling bottled wines was caused by wines with a protected designation of origin.

A look at different markets shows that the decline in sales to Asia and North America was partially offset by increased exports to Europe, Oceania, and Africa. Of course, these could not compensate for the losses, especially in the USA and China. Deliveries to the United States from January to September 2025 fell by 10.6% in value and 3.5% in volume. However, looking at the third quarter of last year in isolation, French wine exports to the USA collapsed by 39% in value and 15.1% in volume, as average prices fell by 28.5%, which Del Rey believes was intended to offset the higher tariffs.

In China, the volume of French wine exports in the first nine months of 2025 even fell by 36%. The fact that the value only decreased by 23.8% is—unlike the situation in the USA—thanks to a price increase of 19%. The export losses are not due to the customs situation, but to the structural decline in wine consumption in China—whereby the French premiumization strategy prevented worse.

As different as the respective problems are, according to Del Rey, in view of some of the main competitors such as Australia and Italy, ""France suffered the largest decline among major suppliers."" Incidentally, exports to South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and Luxembourg (–€48.5m alone) also fell. Better sales were achieved in Australia and New Zealand, but also in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. As an outlook, Del Rey summarized: "" For all producers, market diversification, product innovation, and a stronger focus on premium wines as well as fresher and new wine-based beverages appear essential to navigating this increasingly complex environment.” SP",https://www.meininger.de/sites/meininger.de/files/fields/field_a_artikelbild/web_Frankreich-Exporte_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:05:14.699130

The San Diego-based company has made no secret of the fact that it was hoping to find additional pharma backing. Sanofi had already secured the right to first negotiation for Ventyx’s Parkinson’s and cardiovascular disease candidate VTX3232 as part of a $27 million investment the French pharma made in the biotech in 2024.

A first readout from a phase 2 study of VTX3232 last June tied the NLRP3 inhibitor to drops in biomarkers of NLRP3 inhibition as well as improvements in Parkinson’s motor and non-motor symptoms.

At the time, Ventyx CEO Raju Mohan, Ph.D., acknowledged that Sanofi’s right of first negotiation wouldn’t formally start until the second VTX3232 readout. But the CEO gave a strong hint that the company didn’t want to wait that long to secure a Big Pharma partner.

“Sanofi is not restricted to waiting until the second readout,"" Mohan said at a Jefferies event in June 2025. “They or anybody else can act any time. We can't solicit other folks as part of [the right of first negotiation], but somebody can say, ‘Hey, look, we love your data.’”

It sounds like Lilly did just that. The U.S. pharma announced Wednesday that it was paying $14 per share of Ventyx—more than double the $7.50 the stock closed out at Monday. The price tag values Ventyx at around $1.2 billion, Lilly explained in a Jan. 7 release.

VTX3232 doesn’t only have potential for Parkinson’s patients. In October, Ventyx read out data from a separate phase 2 study demonstrating that the drug cut levels of a biomarker for stroke and other serious risks by almost 80% within a week. That trial looked at VTX3232 as a monotherapy as well as an add-on to Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight loss drug semaglutide.

Beyond VTX3232, Ventyx has another NLRP3 inhibitor, dubbed VTX2735, in phase 2 studies for a type of heart inflammation called recurrent pericarditis. There are also two inflammatory bowel disease drugs in phase 2 development—an S1P1R modulator called tamuzimod and a TYK2 inhibitor called VTX958.

Mohan described Lilly as an “ideal strategic partner,” pointing to the pharma’s “unparalleled resources, a passion for innovative oral drugs and a commitment to advance novel therapies.”

“Our portfolio of class-leading NLRP3 inhibitors modulate residual and chronic inflammation that is now recognized as a major risk factor in a host of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases,” Mohan added.

Explaining the rationale behind the deal, Lilly Chief Scientific and Product Officer Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., alluded to “increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases.”

“Ventyx's clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity,” Skovronsky added.

William Blair analysts said yesterday’s deal “demonstrates clear interest from Big Pharma in the NLRP3 inhibitor class to address a broad range of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic, and cardiovascular diseases.”

In a Jan. 8 note, the analysts pointed out that other biopharmas are working in the NLRP3 space, name-checking the likes of Novartis, Neumora, Neurocrine Biosciences, BioAge, NodThera and Monte Rosa Therapeutics.

“NLRP3 in the [central nervous system] also represents an intriguing target for obesity and several preclinical studies across NLRP3 inhibitors suggest obesity efficacy in diet-induced-obesity models,” the analysts added. “However, not all NLRP3 inhibitors are CNS-penetrant.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/M%26A24.jpg?VersionId=C.FsKt7NUy1obRC7ODrMf.NqCjMX0jfl,N,,2026-01-08 11:04:37.687177

You see, instead of randomly assigning colours to bulbs, SpatialAware uses your phone’s camera to scan the room and map each light’s position. The system then applies colours in a way that mirrors real-world effects, such as a sunset glowing warmly on one side of the room while the opposite side fades into darker tones.

Smarter scenes, smoother moods

Lighting scenes have always been a highlight of the Hue app, offering quick ways to set a mood or transform a space. The problem was that colours often felt scattered, with no sense of flow between bulbs. That mismatch could break the illusion, leaving rooms looking more chaotic than calming.

SpatialAware fixes this by tailoring palettes to the actual layout of your lights, creating a sense of harmony across the room.

The difference is striking: instead of random splashes of colour, you get gradients that feel intentional and immersive.

Nature‑inspired scenes such as “Savannah Sunset” or “Lake Mist” show off the feature best, with ceiling lights glowing like open skies while floor lamps settle into deeper tones that ground the space. The result is a more cohesive atmosphere that feels closer to how light behaves in the real world, making everyday moments at home more inviting.

Bridge Pro gets its moment

SpatialAware requires the Hue Bridge Pro, which launched last year. The latest update allows users to consolidate multiple bridges into one, supporting up to 150 lights and 50 accessories. That’s a big win for households already juggling several hubs.

AI assistant and Apple Home integration

Philips Hue’s AI assistant is also stepping up. It now creates automations based on natural requests, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. Language support continues to expand beyond English to include Dutch, German, and Spanish.

Meanwhile, Apple Home users will soon enjoy seamless integration with Hue Secure cameras, video doorbells, and sensors.

On the other hand, features like live streaming in picture-in-picture on Apple TV and real-time alerts in the Apple Home app are on the way.",https://www.the-ambient.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/philips-hue-omniglow-strip-light.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:04:00.175365

The shopping season, which spans November 1 through December 31, saw 25 days when spending hit $4 billion, besting 2024’s 18 days. Use of buy now, pay later methods also peaked this year, up 9.8% to $20 billion, posting the largest-ever spend day on Cyber Monday.

Online Cyber Week spend rose 7.7% YoY to $44.2 billion online. While Cyber Monday proved to be the biggest e-commerce day of the year, bringing in $14.25 billion in spend (up 7.1%), Black Friday’s growth actually outpaced Cyber Monday, with online spend jumping 9.1% to $11.8 billion.

Electronics were the top category, up 8.2% YoY to $59.8 billion, followed by apparel and furniture. Cosmetics got a 9.3% bump to $8.4 billion, while grocery spend increased 10.2% to $23.7 billion. Top sellers included video games, refrigerators and freezers, washers and dryers, and headphones and speakers.

Consumers shopped on their phones even more this season, with smartphone transactions accounting for 56.4% of online spend, compared to 54.5% in 2024. Mobile shopping peaked on Christmas Day, followed by Thanksgiving.

Discounts were, of course, a draw for consumers, particularly within electronics (the top discounts reached ~31% off), toys, apparel, TVs, computers, sporting goods, appliances, and furniture. Many consumers opted to use the season to purchase higher-ticket items, with units sold rising 20% versus the rest of the year, with the top category—electronics—up 56%.

Adobe also found that generative AI traffic to retail sites jumped 693.4% during the holiday season, though it noted the number of consumers using these tools was “modest.”

We can all benefit by staying focused on how these and other key trends unfold.","Welcome to 2026. Drug store and grocery retailers will have major opportunities to make progress on strategies in areas such as artificial intelligence, pricing, pharmacy and loyalty.

Some emerging retail trends, especially in technology, will become mainstream. Other trends will represent unique, strategic opportunities.

Here are five key trends to watch.

1. Price/Value Messaging will be 24/7

After a holiday in which price and savings took center stage in retail messaging, from Walgreens to Target, companies will need to figure out how to incorporate this in an ongoing way. Price and value strategies will be crucial because approaching year-end Consumer Confidence remained weak and many shoppers were pulling back on discretionary spending and focusing more on price-value optimization, according to the 2026 Food and Beverage retail sector outlook published in early December by Circana, a Chicago-based market research firm.

2. AI Will Drive Customer and Employee Engagement

AI is quickly moving from promise to reality at retail. It is supporting shopper journeys in ways that guarantee it will become more ubiquitous this year and beyond. Walmart introduced new AI-powered tools for holiday 2025 geared to helping customers find deals, locate products and shop efficiently in-store and online. Kroger, meanwhile, enhanced its Instacart relationship by making available to customers Instacart’s AI assistant called Cart Assistant, for those shopping on the Kroger iOS mobile app.

3. Loyalty Rewards to Push Envelope

Retailers are ratcheting up strategies to reward their most loyal shoppers, by offering exclusive opportunities and launching contests, for example. Albertsons recently became the first major grocer to offer Uber One perks to free and paid loyalty members through extended free trials. Aldi, meanwhile, unveiled a contest to celebrate its most loyal fans by asking for feedback on why they should be considered a “Super Fan?” An exclusive group of 25 winners are offered a year’s worth of free groceries, an invitation to a members-only event and Aldi merch. As shoppers feel more love from retailers, they will likely want more TLC in 2026.

4. Pharmacy Embracing the Long View

Pharmacies are taking proactive approaches to bolster their futures by enhancing relevancy to customers and society. CVS Health has been conducting extensive research on how to advance community pharmacy. The retailer released 2025 Rx Report: Community Pharmacy Reimagined, which explores how community pharmacies are adapting to meet needs amid a changing landscape. In another example, Walgreens has conducted what it calls the longest commitment to clinical research for a U.S. retail pharmacy, citing three years of leading a community-based research effort to improve patient access.

5. Store Development to Pursue Unique Approaches

In some years store development trends have been relatively uniform across retail. That has been anything but the case lately. Retailers are taking highly individual approaches, a dynamic likely to continue. Last year Target opened the latest of its larger-format units, a nearly 150,000-square-foot location in South Riding, Va. Contrast that with a recent strategy from Whole Foods Market, which has been opening locations of its smaller-format store concept, called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop, with footprints of only a few thousand square feet each.

Why are these trends important? In my annual outlook piece a year ago, I mentioned it’s easy for retailers to get so involved in day-to-day activities that they miss key changes in the most important business developments. That point is truer than ever. We can all benefit by staying focused on how these and other key trends unfold.",https://drugstorenews.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/assetbank_2583282911.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:03:06.948313

Kennedy Jr. and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. This historic reset—described by Kennedy as the most significant overhaul in decades—places real food, protein, and healthy fats squarely at the center of U.S. nutrition policy, while calling for a dramatic reduction in highly processed foods.

At a White House press conference, Kennedy declared, “These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation's food culture and make America healthier again.” Flanked by Rollins and other health officials, he introduced an updated food pyramid that visually prioritizes vegetables, proteins like red meat and eggs, cheese, and healthy fats such as olive oil and butter, with whole grains now forming the base of the pyramid. The visual overhaul is more than symbolic: it reflects a fundamental shift in federal thinking about what constitutes a healthy diet.

The new guidelines, updated every five years, are the backbone of federal food policy. They influence what’s served in school cafeterias, on military bases, and in food aid programs for mothers and infants. According to NPR, Kennedy and Rollins wrote that more than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, attributing this crisis to a national diet “reliant on highly processed foods and coupled with a sedentary lifestyle.”

For the first time, the government is formally recommending that Americans cut down on ultra-processed foods. The guidelines explicitly warn against “packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet,” as well as sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, fruit drinks, and energy drinks. Parents are advised to avoid all added sugars and artificial sweeteners for children under four years old, and the guidelines recommend no amount of added sugar for children under ten. “No amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is part of a healthy diet,” the guidelines state, a stance that has drawn both praise and criticism from industry groups.

The new recommendations also call for Americans to “limit alcoholic beverages,” a departure from previous guidelines that specified daily limits for men and women. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, commented at the press conference, “There was never good data to support the previously recommended level of alcohol consumption.” He added, “In the best-case scenario, I don't think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize.”

One of the most controversial aspects of the new guidelines is the administration’s stance on saturated fats. Kennedy proclaimed, “We are ending the war on saturated fats,” arguing that protein and healthy fats “were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.” The document encourages Americans to prioritize oils with essential fatty acids like olive oil, but also includes butter and beef tallow as acceptable options. Still, the guidelines maintain the long-held recommendation that saturated fat should not exceed 10% of daily calories—a point of contention for some nutrition experts.

“I'm very disappointed in the new pyramid that features red meat and saturated fat sources at the very top, as if that's something to prioritize. It does go against decades and decades of evidence and research,” said Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University and a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, as reported by NPR. Both the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics point to evidence linking excess saturated fat to heart disease. The AHA, while welcoming the new emphasis on fruits and vegetables and the call to limit highly processed foods and added sugars, continues to encourage Americans to prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood, and lean meats, and to limit high-fat animal products such as red meat, butter, lard, and tallow.

Despite the criticism, some experts see merit in the new approach. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University, told NPR, “Both low-fat and whole-fat dairy versions of milk, cheese, and yogurt have been linked to lower cardiovascular risk. What's quite interesting is that the fat content doesn't seem to make a big difference.” He also praised the guidelines’ focus on reducing highly processed foods, saying, “Highly processed foods are clearly harmful for a range of diseases, so to have the U.S. government recommend that a wide class of foods be eaten less because of their processing is a big deal and I think a very positive move for public health.”

The guidelines emphasize a diet rich in “high-quality, nutrient-dense” proteins at every meal. These include red meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and, for those who prefer plant-based options, beans, peas, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy. According to the official HHS press release, the guidelines are intended to “improve Americans’ health by focusing on nutrition policy reform.”

Reactions from the food and beverage industry have been mixed. The Consumer Brands Association, representing major food companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, expressed a willingness to work with the administration while noting that consumers still “seek a diverse selection of foods.” The American Beverage Association, however, criticized the recommendations to limit both added sugar and other sweeteners. “Americans deserve pragmatic advice they can use in daily life. Guidance that discourages sugar but dismisses safe, effective no sugar options is impractical and inherently contradictory,” spokesperson William Dermody said in a statement to Axios.

Meanwhile, advocacy groups and influencers aligned with Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda have welcomed the changes. Vani Hari, known as the “Food Babe,” called the new guidelines “a dream come true,” telling Axios, “We put our full support in for Secretary Kennedy because he told the truth for the first time about the American food system ... and he is following through with his promise.”

It’s worth noting that while the guidelines have shifted to embrace more protein and healthy fats, they continue to recommend moderation and balance—echoing a longstanding body of nutritional science. A 2024 panel of nutrition experts advised HHS and USDA to encourage Americans to eat less saturated fat and meat, and to be cautious about ultra-processed foods. The new guidelines blend these expert recommendations with Kennedy’s own priorities, resulting in a policy that is both a break from and a continuation of past approaches.

As the updated guidelines begin to shape federal food programs, school lunches, and the choices Americans make at the dinner table, the nation is set for a new chapter in its ongoing debate over nutrition. Whether these changes will lead to measurable improvements in public health remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the conversation around what Americans eat has never been more front and center.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/aItl4xdZlb1wN4r52NxdJ_arVEI=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2Fda7f0ab9-d494-4c8f-b861-44803ef70a8d.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 14:02:18.193509

Aer Lingus currently serves 12 destinations in the U.S. A4A says the cap threatens to trigger the withdrawal of historic airport slots held by U.S. carriers at DUB, reducing or eliminating transatlantic services.
JetBlue, which launched its first flights to DUB in 2024, was previously denied requests to expand service because of capacity constraints tied to the passenger cap, according to the filing.
The group says this would violate provisions of the U.S.-EU agreement that guarantee airlines a “fair and equal opportunity to compete” and prohibit unilateral restrictions on traffic volumes.
The complaint asks the DOT to call a special meeting under the U.S.-EU air services agreement and to issue a show-cause order unless Ireland introduces emergency legislation to suspend or remove the cap by early February.","U.S. airlines have formally asked the U.S. Transportation Department (DOT) to intervene in a long-running dispute over passenger limits at Dublin Airport (DUB), arguing that the continued enforcement of a cap could restrict transatlantic service.

In a complaint filed Jan. 5, trade group Airlines for America (A4A) accused Ireland and the European Union of violating the U.S.-EU Air Transport Agreement and U.S. law by maintaining a local planning condition that caps passenger volumes at Dublin Airport at 32 million annually—a limit first imposed in 2007 tied to the construction of Terminal 2.

The filing, submitted under the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act, asks the DOT to take expedited action, including potentially curtailing Irish airlines’ access to the U.S. market if Ireland does not move to lift or suspend the cap. Aer Lingus currently serves 12 destinations in the U.S.

A4A says the cap threatens to trigger the withdrawal of historic airport slots held by U.S. carriers at DUB, reducing or eliminating transatlantic services. The group adds only an ongoing legal stay granted by Ireland’s High Court has so far prevented slot losses after airlines successfully challenged regulatory attempts to enforce seasonal limits tied to the cap.

Among the airlines cited in the complaint are Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and JetBlue Airways, which A4A says will be disproportionately affected if historic slots were withdrawn. JetBlue, which launched its first flights to DUB in 2024, was previously denied requests to expand service because of capacity constraints tied to the passenger cap, according to the filing.

The complaint outlines parallel legal proceedings in Ireland and at the Court of Justice of the European Union, where questions have been referred about whether the passenger cap complies with EU slot allocation rules. An advisory opinion from the court’s advocate general is due Feb. 12, with a final ruling expected later in 2026.

A4A argues that the EU court process does not address U.S. treaty rights and warns that an adverse ruling could allow Ireland to impose unilateral limits on air service. The group says this would violate provisions of the U.S.-EU agreement that guarantee airlines a “fair and equal opportunity to compete” and prohibit unilateral restrictions on traffic volumes.

Currently, DUB is exceeding the 32 million limit, handling around 36 million passengers in 2025, owing in part to High Court stays on enforcement.

The filing also details enforcement action launched by Fingal County Council, the local planning authority, against the airport operator for exceeding the cap. Airport operator daa has previously attempted to raise the limit to 36 million passengers.

Ireland’s government has publicly committed to removing the cap and has progressed draft legislation to increase or abolish the restriction, but no bill has yet become law. A4A says delays could force service reductions as early as the winter 2026-27 season if enforcement proceeds.

The complaint asks the DOT to call a special meeting under the U.S.-EU air services agreement and to issue a show-cause order unless Ireland introduces emergency legislation to suspend or remove the cap by early February.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2026-01-08 17:03:39.950344

InvestingPro data confirms Medtronic’s financial strength, with $5.2 billion in free cash flow and liquid assets exceeding short-term obligations. Trading near its 52-week high at $100.09, Medtronic appears fairly valued according to InvestingPro’s Fair Value model and maintains a solid ""GOOD"" financial health score of 2.99.

Cardiac monitoring was highlighted as the sector most likely to see acquisition activity, with Piper Sandler noting ""there are a couple of big players without exposure here,"" while predicting that even if immediate deals don’t materialize, 2026 will experience ""strong deal flow"" for both public and private assets. With a market cap of $128.2 billion and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6, Medtronic has maintained dividend payments for an impressive 49 consecutive years. For investors tracking potential M&A moves, InvestingPro offers comprehensive Pro Research Reports on 1,400+ top stocks including Medtronic, with additional ProTips and financial metrics that provide deeper insights for smarter investment decisions.

In other recent news, Medtronic has announced significant developments across its operations. The company’s diabetes unit, MiniMed, has filed for an initial public offering with plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. This move is part of a broader strategy to separate the diabetes business through capital market transactions. In addition, a real-world analysis published in Diabetes Care highlighted the effectiveness of Medtronic’s MiniMed 780G system in maintaining glucose control, even when users missed mealtime insulin doses.

Meanwhile, William Blair has upgraded Medtronic’s stock rating from Market Perform to Outperform, citing the company’s promising product pipeline and anticipated organizational changes. This upgrade suggests potential growth as Medtronic enters 2026 with new product launches.

The new show, called Bring My Pinterest to Life, follows three influencers (Drew Michael Scott, Caroline Vazzana and TayBeepBoop*) as they work with the platforms’ users on projects using a Pinterest board for inspiration. Each 22-minute episode will include real pins and boards, which viewers can save, shop, and explore without clicking away from the show. Some of the brands that will be available to shop on the show have already been announced, including Wayfair and Eos.

While Pinterest videos were already available to watch on CTV as Pinterest+, this will be the first TV show made by the platform. Other brands have successfully made the leap into entertainment — such as Red Bull — but not many. And Pinterest faces unique challenges as a platform that hosts no original content.

But the move is not completely out of the blue. In December, Pinterest announced its acquisition of cost-per-outcome CTV ad platform TvScientific, although the deal is still under regulatory review and is not expected to be confirmed until later this year.

At the time of the purchase, a spokesperson for Pinterest commented: ‘TvScientific’s outcome-based CTV platform will be integrated directly into Pinterest’s performance products, including its automation and AI-powered advertising suite, Pinterest Performance+.’

Pinterest’s announcement described the format, with its integrated ads, as an ‘emotionally resonant, shoppable’ ‘full-funnel path’ for viewers. It mirrors other features added to Pinterest to capture the full consumer journey, such as the shoppable recipes rolled out last month and Where to Buy links for consumer packaged goods pinned on the platform.

The trailer for Bring My Pinterest to Life was uploaded to YouTube on 5 Jan, and the show itself will be streaming on Roku from 23 March. The trailer is unlisted, and at time of writing has been viewed slightly under 500 times — and three of those were by me.

Earlier this month, Media War and Peace writer Evan Shapiro predicted that this would be the year of brands converting from traditional influencer marketing to launching their own content channels. He highlighted recently-launched brand channels or production companies from Under Armour, Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal as examples of this trend coming at a time when ‘the creator economy’ is taking up more and more of people’s consumption hours and brands ‘must become creators themselves’ to compete for attention.

‘There may be influencers and creators on it, but the [brand’s channel] will become an influencer and a creator,’ he said.

This aligns with the broader analyst sentiment, as Nvidia currently holds a strong buy consensus recommendation with targets ranging from $140 to $352.

The research firm cited Nvidia’s sustained technological leadership, growing strategic partnerships, and full software stack as key reasons for its positive outlook on the stock. These strengths have helped Nvidia achieve remarkable 65.22% revenue growth over the last twelve months, cementing its position as a prominent player in the semiconductor industry.

Piper Sandler also highlighted Nvidia’s favorable valuation at approximately 24.5 times price-to-earnings ratio on a next-twelve-months basis as another factor supporting its bullish stance. While InvestingPro data shows a current P/E of 46.77, the stock’s PEG ratio of 0.78 suggests it’s trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its growth rate. According to InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment, Nvidia appears slightly undervalued at current levels.

The firm expressed particular enthusiasm about the expected performance gains from Nvidia’s Vera Rubin rack, which is anticipated to generate revenues in the second half of 2026.

In the same research note, Piper Sandler mentioned Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) as likely to benefit most from a recovery in the analog space, and identified Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) as its top small-cap idea with multiple potential catalysts ahead.

In other recent news, Nvidia has maintained its strong position in the market with reaffirmations from major financial analysts. Stifel has reiterated its Buy rating for Nvidia, setting a price target of $250, citing a positive outlook on Nvidia’s sales in China and highlighting the potential impact of H200-based sales on earnings. Similarly, Citi has also reiterated a Buy rating, maintaining a slightly higher price target of $270. In a strategic move, Nvidia is now requiring Chinese clients to make full upfront payments for H200 AI chips, with no options for cancellations or refunds, underscoring the demand and value of these chips.

Additionally, Nvidia’s new Rubin chip has been introduced, showcasing its ability to operate at higher temperatures compared to traditional data center processors. This development could signify a shift in cooling norms within the industry. However, the announcement has led to a 5% drop in Munters shares, as the new chip challenges existing cooling technologies. These recent developments highlight Nvidia’s ongoing influence and strategic maneuvers in the tech industry.

Two of the four major trends the company highlights lean into emotional resonance and genuine experience, which suggests a shift from purely technical capabilities to deeper human storytelling.

One of the trends is termed ‘Connectioneering,’ which explains visuals that stir emotions and spark connection.

According to Adobe, audiences are increasingly drawn to work that reflects shared human experiences and conveys genuine feelings, which is something AI, at its core, cannot truly feel or originate.

This trend stresses that photographers and creatives should focus on emotional impact and human connection in their work.

Authentic cultural storytelling was also a trend termed as local flavors, which is major as it centres on authentic regional and cultural expression. Adobe reports growing demand from brands and enterprises for content that genuinely reflects local identity and experiences.

This move taps into a broader creative desire for work grounded in place, culture, and lived experience, countering generic, AI-generated imagery.

While AI remains a tool in the creative toolkit, for instance, in generating surreal visuals or new forms of expression, Adobe’s forecast suggests the true value lies in how creators use AI to support, not replace, their vision.

OpenAI is releasing ChatGPT Health, a dedicated service within the AI chatbot for health-related queries.

The new service is marketed as the secure and a ‘one stop shop’ way of asking ChatGPT personal health questions.

Users can connect their medical records and wellness apps such as Apple Health and MyFitnessPal to ChatGPT, allowing the bot access to analyse the data and output informed responses, according to OpenAI. This can include understanding test results, preparing for appointments, and advice on diet and workouts.

The AI giant added that the service is designed to “support, not replace” medical care.

According to OpenAI, more than 230m people globally ask health and wellness-related questions on ChatGPT every week. However, these are not entirely private.

Speaking in a podcast last year, CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT does not offer doctor-patient confidentiality the same way a trained human professional would. “People talk about the most personal shit in their lives to ChatGPT.”

This, he said, could lead to privacy concerns in the case of a lawsuit, because OpenAI would be legally required to produce those conversations. Plus, if left to its default settings, ChatGPT also takes user inputs and content to train its models.

OpenAI claimed that ChatGPT Health tries to mitigate these issues.

The company stated that ChatGPT Health is built with purpose-built encryption and isolation to keep health conversations “protected and compartmentalised”.

Conversations from the service are also not used to train OpenAI’s foundation models, the company said. And although ChatGPT might take data from non-Health chats, OpenAI claims that data shared to Health will not flow back out the other way.

OpenAI added that users can view or delete Health memories at any time within Health or the ‘Personalisation’ section of the service’s settings.

OpenAI said it has worked for more than two years with more than 260 physicians across the world to develop the service. The company claimed that the chatbot has been evaluated against clinical standards set by an assessment framework OpenAI has created specifically for examining health-related outputs.

Interested users outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK can sign up for the waitlist to join ChatGPT Health, which will run with a small cohort of users to refine the experience. The company plans to expand access and make the service available to users across the web and iOS in the coming weeks, it said.

With hundreds of millions using AI chatbots, information shared to ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini and others are not just valuable to the companies providing the services. A security firm recently uncovered a VPN service which captured conversations users were having on AI platforms, selling it for marketing purposes.",https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-doctor.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 11:05:47.980366

Following the agreement, Uber will integrate TomTom’s maps, Maps APIs and live services across its global platform. The partnership will enhance Uber’s routing, fare calculations, and pick-up and drop-off accuracy, particularly in complex locations such as airports, transit hubs and stadiums. This is expected to reduce travel time and uncertainty while improving reliability and operational efficiency for both drivers and riders.

TomTom’s mapping platform continuously aggregates data from thousands of sources and processes billions of data points to keep maps current. The technological collaboration establishes a feedback loop in which anonymized real-world data from Uber trips is incorporated into TomTom’s maps, improving updates on roads, turn restrictions and closures.

Uber and TomTom are building on their long-standing partnership (the initial deal was inked in 2015) and actively exploring new opportunities to introduce additional location-based tools that will further expand the capabilities of the former’s platform and enhance the overall user experience.

We remind investors that way back in 2015, Uber had looked to buy Nokia's NOK mapping division, HERE, for around $3 billion. The aim of buying Nokia’s mapping division was to gain control of mapping technology for its core services and future self-driving cars. However, Uber ultimately lost its bid to buy Nokia’s mapping service, which was sold to a consortium of German automakers.

Following the failure to buy Nokia’s HERE, Uber partnered with TomTom and also acquired Microsoft's MSFT Bing Maps imagery division, bringing in talent and street-level data for autonomous vehicle development. Through this deal, Uber absorbed data-collection engineers from Microsoft to bolster its mapping work. Roughly 100 Microsoft employees joined Uber following the deal.

The tenure of Kraft Heinz's new Chief Executive, Steve Cahillane, begins with a significant and unexpected hurdle. A sudden shift in U.S. federal dietary guidelines, framed as a renewed offensive against sugar, poses a direct threat to the company's core business and complicates a major corporate restructuring plan already in motion.

Investor sentiment turned cautious following the policy announcement from Washington. Kraft Heinz shares are currently trading at $23.01, hovering near a 52-week low. This nervousness appears sector-wide, with peers like General Mills and Conagra Brands also recording losses. This pattern suggests a potential rotation away from traditional packaged food stocks as the market digests the long-term implications of the new health agenda.

Policy Reversal Targets Core Product Lines

The pressure stems from a pronounced reversal in U.S. health policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. The administration's updated guidelines now prioritize proteins and healthy fats, explicitly targeting processed foods and added sugars. A specific recommendation to limit consumption to a maximum of 10 grams of sugar per meal strikes at the heart of Kraft Heinz's product portfolio.

This new framework places the company's ""North American Grocery"" segment—home to iconic brands such as Lunchables, Oscar Mayer, and Kool-Aid—under immediate scrutiny. Market observers are not merely flagging a reputational risk but are warning of a tangible danger to a high-volume, core revenue stream.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

Planned Corporate Split Faces New Hurdles

The regulatory development arrives at a critical strategic juncture for Kraft Heinz. The company is planning to separate into two independent publicly traded entities in the second half of 2026: a growth-focused ""Global Taste Elevation"" business (encompassing brands like Heinz and Philadelphia) and the aforementioned ""North American Grocery"" division.

These new guidelines substantially complicate the valuation of the planned grocery spin-off. Should government-backed programs, including public school meal initiatives, align their purchasing with the stricter sugar and processing limits, the segment could face structural revenue declines. This risk may render the spin-off considerably less attractive to potential investors and could force management to reconsider the capital structure of the new entity.

All eyes are now on the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report in February. Analysts anticipate that CEO Cahillane will provide his first detailed commentary on the impact of the evolving political landscape during this update. From a technical analysis perspective, the situation remains tense; a breach of the support level at $22.50 could trigger further downward momentum for the stock.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2426822_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:15:43.716668

Ralph Lauren Investment Narrative Recap

To own Ralph Lauren, you need to believe its premium brand, pricing discipline, and capital returns can offset macro and wholesale volatility. The CFDA manufacturing grants are directionally consistent with its brand and supply chain focus, but do not materially change the key near term catalyst of sustaining pricing power or the main risk that softer demand and higher tariffs could pressure margins if consumers become more price sensitive.

The most relevant recent announcement here is Ralph Lauren’s reaffirmed outlook for mid single digit constant currency revenue growth and operating margin expansion in fiscal 2026, which keeps investor attention on execution in core regions rather than on these relatively small manufacturing grants. The grants sit alongside that guidance as one more data point that the company is investing in product and supply capabilities while managing inflation and wholesale rationalization.

Yet investors should be aware that higher prices and tariff costs could collide with...

Ralph Lauren's narrative projects $8.4 billion revenue and $1.0 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 5.0% yearly revenue growth and an earnings increase of roughly $200 million from $794.7 million today.

If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.

An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

(January 8, 2026) – Johnson & Johnson today announced Tony Hunter, Ph.D., of the Salk Institute as the recipient of the 2025 Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research. Dr. Hunter is honored for his role in the discovery of tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation as mechanisms for the malignant transformation of normal cells into cancer cells and other disease states.

“Dr. Hunter’s discoveries are the cornerstone upon which today’s cancer therapies have been built,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine R&D for Johnson & Johnson. “His groundbreaking work embodies the legacy and spirit of Dr. Paul Janssen and J&J’s ongoing commitment to cancer research – addressing patient needs and improving health for all.”

Dr. Hunter’s seminal discovery four decades ago paved the way for the development of more than 80 cancer therapies and sparked innovation in neuroimmunology, neurology, hematology, and autoimmune disorders. His lab at the Salk Institute continues to lead the field in understanding how chemical additions to proteins control the cell cycle and growth, leading to new potential therapeutic targets for cancers.

An independent committee of world-renowned scientists selected Dr. Hunter for this recognition. He joins 25 other scientists who have received the Dr. Paul Janssen Award since 2004, including ten who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.

“Dr. Hunter’s work stood out to the selection committee for its foundational impact in addressing one of the most pressing medical questions of our generation: Why do cancers thrive, and how do we stop them from growing? His discoveries have already made a great impact, and they continue to pave the way for new innovations in cancer therapies, improving outcomes for patients worldwide,” said Elaine Fuchs, Ph.D., Selection Committee Chair for the Dr. Paul Janssen Award. “As in every year, we had an impressive slate of researchers nominated for their exceptional work in the field of biomedical research.”

Johnson & Johnson will honor Dr. Hunter during a virtual symposium, cohosted with The New York Academy of Sciences on March 2, 2026. The symposium is free to anyone interested in celebrating scientific innovation. (Registration is required.)

“I am delighted to receive the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research,” Hunter said. “I discovered tyrosine phosphorylation as a cancer mechanism while carrying out studies with a simple chicken tumor virus, hoping our findings would give us clues as to how human cancer develops. This serendipitous discovery led to a whole new class of cancer drugs and underscores the importance of funding for basic biomedical research, which can lead to other breakthrough cancer treatments.”

The Dr. Paul Janssen Award builds on Dr. Hunter’s extensive list of international scientific awards and recognitions, including the AACR Lifetime Achievement Award in Cancer Research, the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science and the Sjöberg Prize, among others.

The share price has been choppy recently, with a 1-day share price return of 2.19% decline, but the 90-day share price return of 30.78% suggests momentum has been building even as the 3-year total shareholder return of 28.36% decline shows a tougher longer term picture.

Another View: Multiples Still Point To Value While the popular narrative pegs Helmerich & Payne as roughly fairly priced, the pricing based on sales tells a different story.

The share price has been choppy recently, with a 1-day share price return of 2.19% decline, but the 90-day share price return of 30.78% suggests momentum has been building even as the 3-year total shareholder return of 28.36% decline shows a tougher longer term picture.

If HP’s swings have you rethinking your energy exposure, it could be a good moment to widen the search and look at as potential next ideas.

So with HP trading close to analyst targets but still showing a large modelled intrinsic discount and a mixed return profile, is this a reset that opens up value, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 0% Overvalued

Helmerich & Payne’s most followed narrative sees fair value at about US$30.27 per share, very close to the recent US$30.38 close. This frames an almost fully reflected valuation in the current price.

The company's growing international footprint, highlighted by the successful KCA integration and new tender opportunities in Saudi Arabia and Argentina, positions H&P to capture incremental market share and expand EBITDA as geopolitical instability and supply concerns reinforce demand for high-spec rigs.

Curious what underpins that near one to one match between model and market? Revenue, margins and a richer future earnings multiple all carry weight here.

Result: Fair Value of $30.27 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, you still need to weigh risks like potential rig overcapacity and H&P’s heavy North American exposure, which could pressure utilization, day rates, and cash generation.

Another View: Multiples Still Point To Value

While the popular narrative pegs Helmerich & Payne as roughly fairly priced, the pricing based on sales tells a different story. The current P/S ratio of 0.8x sits below both the fair ratio of 0.9x and the peer and industry averages of 1.2x and 1.1x. That gap suggests the market is assigning a discount that could either indicate caution or potential mispricing. Which side do you think it is?

'This tax equity close reflects the strong economic fundamentals of these solar assets, our ability to construct them efficiently and the growing depth of expertise in the organization,' said Thomas Houghton, CEO and President of Adapture

This commitment marks a major milestone as Adapture advances toward construction completion and commercial operation of the multi-site portfolio. Last year, the company announced a $321 million construction and tax credit bridge facility with MUFG, supporting the broader 441 MW Titanium portfolio, which spans three project sites in Arkansas and Illinois.

'This tax equity close reflects the strong economic fundamentals of these solar assets, our ability to construct them efficiently and the growing depth of expertise in the organization,' said Thomas Houghton, CEO and President of Adapture. 'We are pleased to further our long-standing partnership with U.S. Bank with these projects as we continue delivering high-quality, reliable solar assets to the market.'

U.S. Bank's tax equity investments are a critical source of funding for project construction. 'U.S. Bank invests in renewable energy projects that help strengthen the energy grid and drive local job creation,' said Eric Barr, senior vice president, Environmental Finance, U.S. Bank. 'We are proud to support our long-standing customer Adapture with our tax equity financing and expertise as it expands its Titanium portfolio and delivers clean energy generation.'

'Our teams worked closely and diligently to bring this over the finish line,' said Ben Schneider, Managing Director of Project Finance at Adapture. 'This closing is another major step forward for the Titanium projects, and we are grateful to the team at U.S. Bank for continuing to be a crucial partner in the growth of Adapture's portfolio.'

Construction began on the Titanium portfolio in September 2024, and the first projects are expected to reach commercial operation this year. Once operational, the portfolio is expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 71,000 homes annually.

Not to be outdone, Goldman Sachs also entered the referral fray, offering its retail clients to major RIA customers; Creative Planning, Mercer Advisors and Wealth Enhancement are reportedly among the first to join.

The developments, which were first reported by FAIQ, Citywire and InvestmentNews, come as competition in the mid-tier wealth management segment heats up. Schwab significantly raised the barriers to entry for its own referral network late last month, doubling minimum AUM requirements to $500 million. While Schwab pivoted toward larger firms and wealthier clients (asset minimums now begin at $2 million instead of $500,000), BNY is keeping a more open-door policy:

Advisors using the Advisor Match service will face no AUM minimums.

There will be an annual fee of $50,000 and an annual asset-based fee of as much as 0.3% based on the value of the assets of the referred client, a potential barrier for advisors with less affluent customers.

There are also requirements like federal registration, a fee-based compensation model, and liability insurance and fidelity bond coverage, according to the Dec. 26 filing.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CzBHcum8J7NEJAeH.0BQ0A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_daily_upside_435/9f1313a76ea5a760d369f47da75027e2,N,,2026-01-08 11:15:33.806409

For now, as the AI rally shows signs of fatigue, Wall Street’s attention is increasingly turning to the US consumer.","Strategists on Wall Street are increasingly looking beyond the artificial intelligence trade for fresh drivers of the US equity rally, as concerns grow that enthusiasm for AI-linked stocks may be cooling.

Attention is now shifting toward companies tied to middle-income consumer spending, which some investors see as better positioned to benefit from a broadening economic expansion in 2026.

A team at Goldman Sachs Group, led by strategist Ben Snider, has identified a range of stocks that could gain as household finances improve and spending accelerates.

Their focus is not on essential goods alone, but increasingly on discretionary products and services that consumers buy when confidence rises.

Goldman targets middle-income consumer spending

In a note to investors dated January 6, Snider and his colleagues argued that stocks exposed to middle-income consumers are “particularly attractive” at this stage of the cycle.

The team expects real income growth for this group to accelerate, which will support higher sales growth for companies with steady demand and relatively thin margins.

Goldman’s preferred sectors include healthcare providers, materials producers, and makers of everyday consumer goods.

However, the strongest conviction lies with businesses selling “nice-to-have” products rather than necessities.

This includes retailers of upscale apparel and accessories, household goods manufacturers, tour operators, and casinos.

The call reflects Goldman’s broader expectation that value stocks will continue to outperform into early 2026.

According to the firm, easing pressure from tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump, a stabilising labour market, and tax rebates linked to last year’s major legislation should all help underpin consumer spending.

Retail stocks gain as investors rotate away from AI

The shift in sentiment comes as investors look for alternatives to the AI trade that has dominated markets for the past three years, largely driven by the so-called “Magnificent Seven” technology companies.

With valuations stretched in parts of the tech sector, some investors are increasingly exploring areas that have lagged in recent years.

The S&P Retail Select Industry Index, which includes companies such as CarMax, Etsy, and Academy Sports & Outdoors, is already showing signs of renewed interest.

The index is up 3.5% since the start of the year and has gained 8.8% since early November, coinciding with the peak holiday shopping season.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the US economy to grow by 2.1% this year, with consumer spending providing a key boost.

This outlook has supported a gradual rotation into more traditional value-oriented sectors.

“There is a repricing of economic growth higher,” said Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities International.

He added that such a shift tends to favour value stocks over higher-priced growth names.

Dick’s Sporting Goods highlights early winners

One early beneficiary of the rotation has been Dick’s Sporting Goods.

Shares in the US retailer have risen 6.1% in the first four trading days of 2026, recovering some of the ground lost in 2025, when the stock fell 13%.

Options activity suggests some investors are betting on further gains.

Susquehanna International Group, in a Bloomberg report, said a recent trade could generate up to $3.5 million if the stock moves back toward its early-2025 high of $250 a share.

Dick’s is among several retailers highlighted by Goldman as having strong exposure to rising middle-class wealth, alongside Burlington Stores, Best Buy, Five Below, Levi Strauss, and Gap.

While traditional retailers continue to face competition from e-commerce giants, the search for value amid lofty tech valuations appears to be drawing investor interest elsewhere.

For now, as the AI rally shows signs of fatigue, Wall Street’s attention is increasingly turning to the US consumer.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:15:46.885030

NEW YORK, Jan. 08, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc . (Nasdaq: LXEO), a clinical stage genetic medicine company dedicated to pioneering novel treatments for cardiovascular diseases, today announced a research collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, a global leader in cardiovascular health, to investigate localized cardiac delivery of gene therapy. The collaboration seeks to advance the potential efficacy and safety profile of gene therapy for genetically mediated cardiovascular diseases by concentrating AAV (adeno associated viral) delivery to the heart by investigating cutting-edge routes of administration using Impella™ heart pump technology. Impella heart pumps provide direct cardiac unloading to enhance myocardial perfusion, which may help delivery of gene therapy.

“This collaboration represents an exciting step toward unlocking the full potential of cardiac gene therapy,” said R.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Lexeo’s expectations regarding the partnership and potential of genetic medicines to treat cardiac diseases. Words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “objective,” “intend,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “would,” “expect,” “believe,” “design,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “develop,” “plan” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions, or statements regarding intent, belief, or current expectations, are forward-looking statements. While Lexeo believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on any such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon current information available to the company as well as certain estimates and assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties (including, without limitation, those set forth in Lexeo’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)), many of which are beyond the company’s control and subject to change. Actual results could be materially different from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to: risks and uncertainties related to global macroeconomic conditions and related volatility; expectations regarding the initiation, progress, and expected results of Lexeo’s preclinical studies, clinical trials and research and development programs; the unpredictable relationship between preclinical study results and clinical study results; delays in submission of regulatory filings or failure to receive regulatory approval; liquidity and capital resources; and other risks and uncertainties identified in Lexeo’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2025, filed with the SEC on November 5, and subsequent future filings Lexeo may make with the SEC. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties. Lexeo claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. Lexeo expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter any statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation.","If you are wondering whether Eli Lilly's share price still makes sense at around US$1,108, you are not alone. Many investors are asking what they are really paying for at this level.

The stock has recently posted returns of 3.1% over the last 7 days, 11.1% over the last 30 days, 2.6% year to date, 41.8% over the last year and a very large gain over 5 years, which naturally raises questions about growth potential and changes in perceived risk.

Recent headlines have focused on Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes treatments, which have been a key talking point for the company and the sector. Media coverage has often linked these products to investor interest, helping frame how the market is thinking about the current share price.

Our valuation work gives Eli Lilly a . Next we will walk through the main valuation approaches investors commonly use and then finish with a different way of thinking about what the stock could be worth.

Eli Lilly scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the .

Approach 1: Eli Lilly Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to today using a required rate of return. It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in current terms.

For Eli Lilly, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $6.2b. Analysts supply detailed Free Cash Flow estimates for several years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further to build a 10 year path, reaching a projected Free Cash Flow of $59.2b in 2035. These projections, all in $, are then discounted to arrive at a single estimate of value per share.

On this basis, Eli Lilly’s DCF fair value is calculated at US$1,253.18 per share, compared with a current share price of about US$1,108. That implies an intrinsic discount of roughly 11.6%, which indicates that the shares are trading below this cash flow based estimate of value.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Eli Lilly is undervalued by 11.6%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Eli Lilly Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Eli Lilly, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of earnings. It links directly to the bottom line, which is usually what ultimately matters to shareholders.

What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to go with a lower P/E.

Eli Lilly currently trades on about 53.89x earnings, compared with the Pharmaceuticals industry average of about 19.90x and a peer group average of about 16.96x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Eli Lilly is 42.45x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be, given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and identified risks.

Because the Fair Ratio incorporates those company specific drivers, it can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry. With the current P/E of 53.89x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 42.45x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.

Result: OVERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation. On Simply Wall St that starts with Narratives, which are your own story for Eli Lilly that links what you believe about its GLP 1 opportunity, risks and margins to a forecast for revenue, earnings and cash flows, and then to a fair value you can compare with today’s price.

On the Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an easy tool to set their assumptions and see a live fair value that updates when new earnings, news or regulatory developments come through. This means you can always see how fresh information might affect your view.

For Eli Lilly right now, one Narrative on the platform uses a fair value of about US$1,189 per share, while another uses about US$1,093. This shows how two investors can look at the same company and reach different, but clearly explained, conclusions based on their own expectations and discount rates.

For Eli Lilly however we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Eli Lilly Narratives:

Each one ties the same core facts about GLP 1 demand, pricing, and policy into a different conclusion about what the current US$1,108.09 share price could mean for you.

🐂 Eli Lilly Bull Case

Fair value used in this Narrative: about US$1,189.18 per share

Implied discount to this fair value: about 6.8% below the Narrative value

Revenue growth assumption: 20%

Tirzepatide drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound are treated as the core engine for earnings, with numbers cited for 2024 to 2026 sales expectations and a focus on capacity expansion to meet demand.

The author highlights long patent protection, low GLP 1 penetration in a 100m to 120m U.S. addressable market and gradually improving insurance coverage as key supports for the story.

Risks flagged include high monthly pricing, new entrants, potential side effects and lawsuits, and a high current P/E, but the Narrative still arrives at a fair value around US$1,200 based on 20% to 25% revenue growth over 3 to 5 years and a 9% discount rate.

🐻 Eli Lilly Bear Case

Fair value used in this Narrative: about US$1,093.22 per share

Implied premium to this fair value: about 1.4% above the Narrative value

Revenue growth assumption: 18.12%

This Narrative leans on analyst assumptions that revenue grows at about 18.7% a year over 3 years, profit margins widen from 25.9% to 38.4% and earnings reach US$34.2b by around September 2028, but questions whether the P/E can stay at a premium level.

It stresses concentration in a handful of GLP 1 products, exposure to drug price controls and reimbursement decisions, and competition from generics, compounders and other large pharma as possible sources of pressure on margins and volumes.

With a consensus price target of US$891.62 based on those earnings, margin and discount rate assumptions, it concludes that investors need to be comfortable with policy risk, execution risk on manufacturing scale up and litigation overhangs to justify paying close to or above US$1,100.

If you feel one of these fits how you think Eli Lilly’s story plays out, you can use it as a starting point to build or adjust your own assumptions, rather than relying only on a single fair value number.

Johnson & Johnson Investment Narrative Recap

To own Johnson & Johnson today, you need to believe in its ability to replace maturing blockbusters with a broad mix of new medicines and MedTech products while managing legal and cost pressures. The latest nipocalimab and OTTAVA updates support that pipeline story, but they do not materially change the near term focus on how loss of exclusivity, litigation and orthopedics restructuring shape earnings and cash generation over the next few years.

Among recent announcements, the positive Phase 2b JASMINE data for nipocalimab in systemic lupus erythematosus stands out, as it reinforces Johnson & Johnson’s emphasis on Innovative Medicine as a key growth driver. For investors tracking catalysts, this lupus program sits alongside other immunology and oncology efforts as part of the broader effort to offset STELARA erosion and support the company’s long running dividend profile.

Investors responded to Zeta pushing its platform beyond reporting and orchestration tools toward something closer to an operating layer for marketing decisions.

At the centre of its shift is Athena, Zeta’s AI agent, which the company is expanding by integrating OpenAI’s models. The intent is to let marketing teams interact with data and campaign systems using natural language, rather than navigating dashboards, queries, and rule sets. Features like Insights and Advisor, currently in beta, are designed to answer questions, surface patterns, and suggest actions in campaigns.

The move is about product direction. For enterprise brands that rely on platforms like Zeta to run large parts of their marketing operations, it is about something more practical: how work gets done when analysis, guidance, and execution start to blur into a single layer.

When marketing platforms start to guide decisions, not just report results

Marketing teams already sit on vast amounts of data. Performance metrics, audience behaviour, channel results, and spend information are usually available in near real time. The challenge has never been access alone, but interpretation. Turning that data into decisions still requires time, people, and coordination in teams. AI agents are being positioned as a way to compress that cycle.

Instead of asking analysts to pull reports or waiting for weekly reviews, teams could ask why performance shifted, which audiences changed, or how a budget tweak might affect outcomes. The system can respond using the data already inside the platform, framed in language that non-technical users can act on.

That shift sounds incremental, but it changes the role of marketing technology inside an organisation. Platforms stop being places where work is reviewed after the fact and start acting as environments where decisions are shaped as campaigns run.

Where AI agents fit – and where they don’t

Still, what this enables is not the same as what it replaces. Strategy, creative direction, and brand judgement remain human responsibilities. Zeta’s AI tools are framed as support layers, not substitutes. The agent may suggest actions, but teams retain control over whether and how those actions are taken.

Enterprise marketing does not operate in a vacuum: Campaigns are shaped by legal constraints, brand rules, regional differences, and commercial priorities that rarely fit cleanly into automated logic. Any system that oversteps the boundaries risks slowing adoption.

Another tension emanates from the trust factor. As AI agents move closer to execution, marketing leaders will need to understand how suggestions are generated and what data is being used. The promise of speed only holds if teams are confident they can explain and defend decisions made with AI support. Black-box recommendations, even if accurate, can be hard to justify in regulated or high-risk environments.

The OpenAI partnership highlights a dependency shift. Brands are becoming indirect users of large models, even if they never interact with them directly. Model updates, behaviour changes, and reliability issues can ripple into daily operations. That raises questions about resilience and oversight that go beyond marketing teams alone.

For many organisations, adoption will likely be uneven. Some teams may use AI agents to explore data or draft scenarios, while others keep them confined to narrow tasks. The same platform may be used very differently in regions or business units, depending on risk tolerance and maturity.

What Zeta’s move shows is not that AI-driven marketing is ready to run itself, but that the centre of gravity is shifting. Marketing technology isn’t about collecting data and measuring outcomes, but is becoming a space where interpretation, suggestion, and action coexist.

The decision is not whether to use tools like Athena, but how much authority to grant them. As AI agents become part of the infrastructure rather than optional features, teams will need to define clear guardrails, approval paths, and success measures that go beyond speed or efficiency.

IBM and The All England Lawn Tennis Club announce a multi-year renewal of their long-standing technology partnership.

From the launch of the Wimbledon website in 1995 and the mobile application in 2009, to the first integration of enhanced AI-powered solutions in 2017, IBM and the All England Club have collaborated for 36 years to deepen global fan engagement across Wimbledon’s digital platforms.

The new agreement is focused on initiatives to expand the event’s global reach and achieve a deeper fan engagement across Wimbledon’s digital ecosystem in 2026 and beyond.

Teams from IBM and the All England Club work together year-round to co-create unique fan experiences — such as Live Likelihood to Win and Match Chat — that combine the significant quantity of data generated during The Championships with the deep AI capabilities of IBM watsonx. In 2025, these efforts contributed to a 16% year-on-year increase in engagement across all platforms, with more than 20 million fans closely following all the grass court action via the app and website. The app alone saw a 19% increase in engagement and received an average rating of 4.9 stars in app stores.

The partnership has also won multiple awards, including the All England Club being recognized as ‘Sports Organization of the Year’ at the 2025 Sports Technology Awards, for the innovative use of AI and technology to transform the Wimbledon fan experience.

“We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,” says Usama Al-Qassab, Marketing & Commercial Director, The All England Lawn Tennis Club. “For 36 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships.

The companies plan to begin offering passenger rides in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year, marking a significant step toward large-scale robotaxi deployment.

Each partner plays a distinct role in the project. Lucid supplies the vehicle platform, using its Gravity electric SUV as the foundation. Nuro contributes the autonomous driving system, replacing the human driver with its software-based Nuro Driver. Uber integrates the vehicle into its ride-hailing ecosystem, giving riders access through the familiar Uber app.

In practice, this means customers could soon be picked up by a self-driving Lucid vehicle ordered like any other Uber ride.

The Gravity-based robotaxi, unveiled at CES 2026, has been extensively modified for autonomous operation. Classified as a Level 4 vehicle, it is designed to handle most driving situations independently within defined areas. To achieve this, the vehicle relies on a comprehensive sensor suite combining cameras, radar, and LiDAR.

These sensors are seamlessly integrated into the vehicle’s body, along with a roof-mounted “halo” module that provides a full 360-degree view of the surroundings.

At the core of the system is the Nuro Driver software running on Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computing platform. This setup processes vast amounts of sensor data in real time, enabling the vehicle to make rapid and safe driving decisions. Road testing of the autonomous Gravity began in December, laying the groundwork for its commercial rollout.

Passenger experience has been a major focus. The roof-mounted halo includes external displays that show riders’ initials as the vehicle approaches, making it easy to identify in crowded locations.

Inside, passengers sit in the second row and are welcomed by a screen that displays their name, route, and trip details. Riders remain in control, initiating the journey themselves by tapping a “Start Drive” command.

During the trip, the screen explains the vehicle’s actions, such as yielding to pedestrians or changing lanes, helping build confidence and transparency. Climate controls, heated seats, and media settings are also accessible, along with options to contact support or request a safe stop.

Designed for practicality, the robotaxi can accommodate up to six passengers with generous luggage space. Lucid is expected to begin production of the autonomous vehicles at its Arizona facility later this year. Uber aims to deploy as many as 20,000 of these robotaxis over six years, with expansion planned across multiple global markets.",https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/uber_robotaxi_dd5babafbd.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 14:02:24.908479

Nvidia (NVDA) is tightening its sales terms in China, asking customers to pay the full amount up front for its H200 AI chips, according to a Reuters report. The move comes as Beijing has yet to clearly approve shipments, creating risk around delivery timelines.

Under the new terms, Chinese buyers must pay the full amount upfront when placing an order. Once submitted, orders cannot be canceled, refunded, or changed. In certain cases, customers may use commercial insurance or pledged assets as collateral to secure payment instead of paying the full amount in cash. Nvidia and China’s industry ministry have not commented on the policy yet.

China Approval Delays Push Nvidia to Toughen Terms

The tougher terms reflect uncertainty in China’s approval process. While Nvidia has long asked for advance payments from Chinese clients, it previously allowed partial deposits. For the H200, the company is being stricter because it is unclear when regulators will allow shipments.

Adding to the delay, Chinese authorities have asked local tech firms to pause new orders for Nvidia’s H200 chips, which Washington recently approved for export to China. Chinese government regulators are deciding how many locally made chips companies must buy along with each H200 order, which has slowed approvals.

Nvidia Sees Strong H200 Demand Despite China Hurdles

Despite the hurdles, demand remains strong. Chinese companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, priced at about $27,000 each, far above Nvidia’s current inventory of 700,000 chips.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the H200 chip remains “quite high” and that the company has ramped up its supply chain. Notably, the H200 delivers much stronger performance than the now-blocked H20 and still outperforms most domestic chips for large-scale AI training.

Nvidia Shifts Risk to Buyers

Nvidia has reason to be cautious. Last year, the company took a $5.5 billion inventory write-down after a sudden export ban on earlier chips. While U.S. policy now allows H200 sales with a fee paid to Washington, China has since blocked H20 shipments, keeping the risk high.

By asking for full payment upfront, Nvidia protects itself if approvals are delayed again. The financial risk now sits with buyers, who must commit cash without certainty on delivery.

Is NVDA Stock a Buy?

On TipRanks, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $263.76 implies 39.5% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, NVDA stock has gained nearly 35%.

CEO Jensen Huang said this week that Nvidia (NVDA) is looking forward to selling its H200 AI chip in China after winning President Donald Trump's approval in exchange for agreeing to give the U.S. government a 25% cut of sales. CFO Colette Kress said Tuesday that the U.S. government is ""working feverishly"" on the details, and the company expects to begin shipping to China soon.

But the Chinese government's latest moves to halt sales could hobble those plans. Beijing has ordered companies to halt H200 orders, and could follow with a mandate that firms buy domestic chips instead, The Information reported Wednesday. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the report.

Meanwhile, the company is imposing more stringent terms on Chinese clients looking to buy the H200 amid the uncertainty, such as full upfront payment without options to cancel, according to a Reuters report Thursday. Nvidia did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication.

More access to China's market, which Huang has said could be a $50 billion annual opportunity for Nvidia, would represent a significant source of growth for the company. (Nvidia is expected to report full-year revenue above $210 billion.) The chipmaker's latest forecasts did not take China sales of the H200, or H20 that Trump greenlighted back in August, into consideration.

The H20, a less-powerful chip designed specifically for China's market, has also met challenges from Beijing after receiving Trump's backing. The approvals also face opposition at home, with bipartisan efforts by U.S. lawmakers in recent weeks to block the sales.

In a note to clients Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley nodded to possible sales of the AI chips in China as a source of potential upside for the company, but excluded them from their base case for the stock amid lingering worries about political barriers. Analysts at Jefferies and Bernstein, who like Morgan Stanley hold ""buy"" or equivalent ratings on the stock, have also voiced some skepticism about the likelihood of sales.

Shares of Nvidia slid about 2% in Thursday morning trading, leaving them little changed for 2026 after climbing close to 40% last year.

Second IDE approved for U.S. clinical trial for OTTAVA in inguinal hernia procedures

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Johnson & Johnson today announced that the company has submitted the OTTAVA™ Robotic Surgical System to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an application for De Novo classification. Leveraging data from the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, the company has applied for marketing authorization in multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen.

“We have taken learnings from Johnson & Johnson’s 140 years in surgery, our decades of leadership in minimally invasive surgery, and the experiences robotic surgeons and hospitals have had over the past 20 years to design a soft tissue robotic system built for the future of surgery,” said Hani Abouhalka, Company Group Chair, Surgery, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “I am proud of the design decisions and major scientific efforts that have gone into the system to support surgeons and successfully complete our first clinical trial, and I look forward to reaching the next milestone on our path to commercialization.”

Data from first clinical trial supporting submission

First cases in the OTTAVA IDE study were completed in early 2025 at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center by Dr. Erik Wilson*, Chief of Minimally Invasive and Elective General Surgery UT Health Houston and the lead investigator for the clinical study.

OTTAVA’s unique unified architecture, surgical instrumentation powered by Ethicon expertise, and future connection to the Polyphonic™ digital ecosystem are designed to address the unmet needs of surgeons and their teams. The Company filed data from the completed clinical trial with the aim of showcasing safety and effectiveness and supporting the system’s ability to perform a variety of procedures. Given OTTAVA’s novel architecture and differentiated technological capabilities, the company filed a De Novo classification request and is targeting an indication covering multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen, such as gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, small bowel resection and hiatal hernia repair.

“The IDE study builds on a significant body of preclinical evidence we have generated demonstrating the impact of the OTTAVA system and provides critical clinical evidence on the system performance,” said Peter Schulam, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “Surgeon investigators across several hospitals led this important study to further clinical evidence in support of minimally invasive, robotic-assisted surgery for the benefit of clinical teams, hospitals, and patients.”

Second clinical trial approved in hernia repair

OTTAVA is designed as a multi-specialty soft-tissue surgery robot, supporting a broad range of procedures across patient anatomy and surgical specialties, including the most complex surgeries that require a multi-quadrant approach. In late 2025, Johnson & Johnson received IDE approval to begin a U.S. clinical trial for OTTAVA in inguinal hernia procedures, one of the most common surgeries in the U.S.1

The OTTAVA robotic system is under development and is not authorized to be marketed or sold in any market. For more information, visit: http://thenext.jnjmedtech.com/surgical-robotics.

NEW YORK (AP) — Warner Bros. again rejected a takeover bid from Paramount and told shareholders Wednesday to stick with a rival offer from Netflix.

Warner’s leadership has repeatedly rebuffed Skydance-owned Paramount’s overtures — and urged shareholders just weeks ago to back the sale of its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. Paramount, meanwhile, has made efforts to sweeten its $77.9 billion hostile offer for the entire company.

Warner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday that its board determined Paramount’s offer is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. It again recommended shareholders support the Netflix deal.

“Paramount’s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,” Warner Bros. Discovery Chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement. In contrast, he added, the company’s agreement with Netflix “will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty.”

Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s hostile bid is still on the table. Warner shareholders currently have until Jan. 21 to “tender” their shares.

Late last month, Paramount announced an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from Oracle founder Larry Ellison — who is the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison — to back $40.4 billion in equity financing for the company’s offer. Paramount also increased its promised payout to shareholders to $5.8 billion if the deal is blocked by regulators, matching Netflix’s breakup fee.

In its Wednesday letter to shareholders, Warner expressed concerns about a potential deal with Paramount. Warner said it essentially considers the offer a leveraged buyout, which includes a lot of debt, and also pointed to operating restrictions that it said were imposed by Paramount’s offer and could “hamper WBD’s ability to perform” throughout a transaction.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount wants the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes networks like CNN and Discovery.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s news and cable operations would be spun off into their own company, under a previously-announced separation.

A merger with either company could take over a year to close — and will attract tremendous antitrust scrutiny along the way. Due to its size and potential impact, it will almost certainly trigger a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which could sue to block the transaction or request changes. Other countries and regulators overseas may also challenge the merger. And politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Trade groups across the entertainment industry have continued to sound the alarm about both deals.",https://krmg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25339454648803-scaled.webp,N,,2026-01-08 04:58:50.151677

It encompasses well-known brands such as Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten, and Dieterba, along with the Latina production facility.

Founded in 1902, Plasmon is registered as a ‘Historic Trademark of National Interest’ in Italy, where it is a household name synonymous with trust and quality.

Baby Food Production

The Latina plant, which employs approximately 300 people, produces a wide range of infant food and specialised nutrition products, including roughly 1.8 million Plasmon items annually.

Under a co-packing agreement, the facility will continue to produce Heinz Baby Food for the UK market.

As of 31 December 2024, Plasmon reported revenues of around €170 million and an EBITDA of €17 million.

For NewPrinces, this deal significantly strengthens its presence in the baby and specialised food market, particularly across Italy and Europe.

The company expects that the acquisition will drive increased revenue and profit margins, with expected annual revenue growth of around 3% and EBITDA margins reaching 15% in the medium term.

Additionally, it will increase production capacity by combining the Latina plant with NewPrinces’ Ozzano Taro facility and expand Plasmon’s international footprint.

Princes Italia

Princes Italia (a NewPrinces subsidiary) will operate Plasmon’s business under a three-year lease agreement, paying €3 million in annual rent plus 1.5% of revenues.

Angelo Mastrolia, chairman of NewPrinces, commented, ""Bringing home brands like Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten, and Dieterba—which have deep roots in our country's identity—alongside a highly efficient production plant such as the Latina factory, solidifies our position as a leading platform in the high-margin baby and specialised food segment in Italy and Europe.”",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvZXNtbWFnYXppbmUtcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjZcXFwvMDFcXFwvMDcxNjA1MjRcXFwvUGxhc21vbi5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvaW1nLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImZjZjdjODY5Mzk1N2U4NWYwYjc5OTRhNGZkNWYzZDdlYTNkOWNlMGQifQ==/newprinces-group-completes-plasmon-acquisition.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 03:13:22.169174

For fiscal 2026, the company is guiding to a low-single-digit decline in that segment.","Economists use “K-shaped recovery” to describe divergence, where one part of an economy improves while another crumbles. The term gained traction during the pandemic to describe unequal post-COVID outcomes across income groups, sectors and firms. Now the concept fits the fortunes of lab equipment companies, among other things. Major vendors have posted strong numbers in recent earnings, yet the mood among academic researchers remains more muted.

The destocking hangover ends

For equipment suppliers, a single word defined the past two years: destocking. After pandemic-era stockpiling left pharmaceutical and biotech customers sitting on excess inventory, order volumes collapsed. Companies burned through their safety stocks.

That headwind has finally eased. Thermo Fisher Scientific reported Q3 2025 revenue of $11.1 billion, with its Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment generating nearly $6 billion. Danaher, the bioprocessing bellwether, noted “continued momentum” in its filtration and purification business during its Q3 call. Agilent Technologies posted 7.2% core revenue growth in its Q4 fiscal 2025, with management highlighting strength in industrial and applied markets (chemicals, advanced materials, and environmental testing) as a counterweight to softer life sciences demand.

Drug manufacturing is non-discretionary. You cannot produce a dose of a GLP-1 agonist or a monoclonal antibody without consuming filtration media, chromatography resins, and single-use bags. As biologic pipelines advance and production scales, consumables follow.

The NIH question mark

The academic side of the market, in some respects faces more acute challenges. In February 2025, NIH announced a policy capping indirect cost reimbursement at 15% of grant awards. For research universities accustomed to negotiated rates of 50% or higher, the implications were severe. SUNY estimated an immediate $79 million hit to its research enterprise.

But the policy never took effect. Twenty-two states sued, and a federal judge blocked implementation in February 2025. A nationwide injunction followed in March. On January 5, 2026, an appeals court upheld that injunction, meaning the cap remains legally stalled.

The result is more limbo than crisis. University administrators, uncertain whether the cap will eventually survive judicial review, have adopted conservative postures. Capital expenditure decisions that might have been routine (a new mass spectrometer for a core facility, an upgrade to the microscopy suite) now face additional scrutiny.

The numbers bear this out. In Agilent’s Q4 fiscal 2025 results, released November 24, academia and government revenue declined 10%. For fiscal 2026, the company is guiding to a low-single-digit decline in that segment. Pharma, by contrast, grew 12% in the same quarter.

Where the money flows

Recurring revenue streams (consumables, service contracts, reagent kits) remain robust regardless of capital budget cycles. Companies with exposure to industrial and applied markets have found insulation from academic uncertainty. Semiconductor manufacturing, battery R&D and PFAS testing regulations are driving demand for analytical instrumentation on a separate track from NIH funding dynamics.

Bioprocessing consumables, pharma services and industrial applications are carrying the sector. Academic researchers, meanwhile, are waiting on Washington and the courts. For them, 2026 may be another year on the sidelines.",https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-8.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 04:00:11.419245

The device, which HP characterized as the world's first full AI PC built into a keyboard form factor, aims to address growing enterprise demand for computing hardware that adapts to increasingly fluid work environments.

The EliteBoard G1a integrates a complete desktop-class PC—including an AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processor delivering over 50 TOPS of neural processing power—into a keyboard chassis measuring just 12mm thick and weighing 750 grams, according to HP. The device functions as a standalone Copilot+ PC that connects to any display, fundamentally changing the traditional desktop paradigm by making high-performance computing fully portable.

""Work is being redesigned in real time—where it happens, how it happens, and what tools employees need to stay productive,"" Guayente Sanmartin, Senior Vice President and Division President of Commercial Systems & Displays Solutions at HP Inc., said in a statement. ""HP's focus is to remove the friction and complexity that slows people down and turn emerging AI into a real advantage.""

Enterprise demand drives form factor innovation

The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with evolving workplace dynamics that require computing infrastructure to support both traditional desk-based work and more mobile, collaborative scenarios. HP cited findings from its 2025 Work Relationship Index showing that only 44 percent of workers believe their technology fits their working style, the company said.

The EliteBoard G1a represents HP's response to this challenge by collapsing the desktop form factor into something that can move between home offices, corporate workspaces, and shared collaboration areas without sacrificing performance. The device includes dual microphones and speakers integrated into the keyboard housing, eliminating the need for separate peripherals in many scenarios.

From a specifications standpoint, the EliteBoard G1a delivers what HP characterized as desktop-level AI performance through its AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processor, which provides over 50 TOPS of neural processing capability for local AI workloads. This positions the device to handle Copilot+ PC workloads including real-time transcription, translation, and AI-assisted content generation without relying on cloud connectivity, according to the company.

Security and manageability for IT organizations

For IT decision-makers, HP emphasized the device's security architecture, which includes HP Wolf Security for Business with hardware-enforced protection against firmware attacks. The company noted that the security framework has been designed to defend against emerging quantum computing threats, a consideration that is becoming increasingly relevant for enterprise security planning.

The EliteBoard also features a physical security tether and lockable cable option, addressing concerns about securing highly portable computing assets in shared or public work environments. HP characterized the device as an EPEAT 2.0 Gold Registered Product, which may factor into purchasing decisions for organizations with sustainability mandates.

The device incorporates HP Smart Sense and AMD's Auto State Management technology to dynamically adjust performance, cooling, and battery optimization based on workload and environment, the company said. An optional built-in battery configuration extends the device's utility for scenarios where desk-based power connectivity is inconsistent or unavailable.

Premium display technology complements new form factor

Alongside the EliteBoard announcement, HP introduced the Series 7 Pro 4K Monitor featuring what the company described as the world's first Neo:LED desktop display technology. The 31.5-inch monitor delivers IPS black panel performance with a 2,700:1 contrast ratio—double that of traditional IPS displays—and includes factory color calibration for professional creative workflows, according to HP.

The monitor provides 140W power delivery through Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, enabling single-cable solutions for the EliteBoard and other compatible devices. HP emphasized the monitor's 40Gbps data throughput capability as a key feature for professionals working with large files or multiple high-resolution displays.

Market positioning and availability

The EliteBoard G1a and Series 7 Pro 4K Monitor are expected to be available through HP.com beginning in March 2026, the company said. HP did not disclose pricing information in the announcement but indicated that pricing details would be provided closer to the availability date.

The EliteBoard G1a received recognition as a CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree prior to its formal unveiling at the trade show. HP positioned the device as part of its broader strategy to reimagine workplace computing for hybrid and distributed work environments, emphasizing flexibility and AI-powered productivity as key differentiators.

The announcement reflects broader industry trends toward more flexible computing form factors as enterprises seek to equip knowledge workers with tools that support multiple working styles and locations. Whether the keyboard-PC form factor gains traction in enterprise environments will likely depend on IT organizations' willingness to support a departure from traditional desktop and laptop paradigms, particularly regarding asset management, security policies, and user support considerations.",https://www.varindia.com/storage/news/2026/01/WkPkS4Zf1VWI0I48ODJFFftYqgfBmQxx3hovvELz.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 04:00:38.905948

Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cinnadust Seasoning Blend is already sold at larger retailers, such as Walmart, and has quite the following of devoted fans.
While the bottles at Walmart are larger than the bottles at Dollar Tree, the price per ounce is a much better deal at the dollar store.","Cereal isn’t just an easy breakfast option or a delicious midnight snack. It’s full of nostalgia and can instantly take you back to your childhood with every spoonful. Cereal will always be a special and satisfying treat for me, especially Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Everything about it is perfect: the amount of cinnamon, the small toast-like pieces, and that crunch. And no matter how much time passes, every bowl of it is as delicious as the last time I had it.

But these days, the General Mills brand has more than just cereal. Its signature Cinnadust flavor has been featured on everything from Muddy Buddies to coffee creamer to actual actual bacon. And now, the iconic seasoning is at Dollar Tree for the cheapest I've seen.

Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cinnadust Spotted at Dollar Tree

If you’re someone who loves anything cinnamon-flavored, you’ll enjoy topping your toast, coffee, ice cream, or other sweet treats with Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cinnadust Seasoning Blend. It tastes just like the iconic cereal, with no shortage of caramel, vanilla, and graham flavor in each bite.

And now, Cinnadust seasoning is on shelves at Dollar Tree. One savvy shopper, @dollartreequeen76, spotted the new find and shared a video on Instagram. And fans jumped in the comments with high praise for the seasoning. ""It’s so good as a topper with your iced coffee,"" one person shared.

Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cinnadust Seasoning Blend is already sold at larger retailers, such as Walmart, and has quite the following of devoted fans. On Walmart's website, shoppers have shared rave reviews. ""It's not just a topping—it's a little jar of joy,"" one person wrote.

""I wasn't going to buy it at first because it seemed silly,"" someone else shared. ""But I'm glad I did. I finished my first jar and just ordered three more!""

Walmart currently has a three-pack of Cinnadust for around $25, but Dollar Tree's new mini jars are $1.25. While the bottles at Walmart are larger than the bottles at Dollar Tree, the price per ounce is a much better deal at the dollar store. So head to your local Dollar Tree now to get a bottle (or two) and add this classic, warm flavor to all of your sweet treats and beverages this winter.

Nvidia has been caught between Washington and Beijing, as the United States tightens controls on exports of advanced semiconductors used in AI, while Chinese companies seek to reduce reliance ‌on US-designed chips.

Tensions over technology trade have been a central ‌feature of broader US-China conflicts, with semiconductors emerging as a strategic flashpoint.

China's directive to suspend orders was issued as the government considers whether, and under what conditions, to allow access to Nvidia's high-performance chips.

Beijing is aiming to discourage local technology companies from rushing to stockpile US chips before a decision is reached, the report said.

""China is committed to ‍basing its national development on its own strengths, and is also willing to maintain dialogue and cooperation with all parties to safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains,"" said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US

Nvidia did not immediately ​respond to a Reuters request for ‌comment and China's Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately return calls outside business hours.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ​said at the Consumer Electronics Show this week that demand in China for its H200 chip ⁠was strong and the company is viewing ‌purchase orders as a signal of approval rather than expecting any formal announcement ​from Beijing.

US export licenses for the chips are still being processed, with no set timeline.

Late last year, US President Donald Trump's administration approved the export ‍of H200 chips to China, a significant reversal of previous bans on advanced AI hardware.

The ⁠approval was based on a condition that the company pay a unique 25 per cent revenue-sharing tax to ​the US government.

The H200 is ‌the predecessor to Nvidia's current flagship ""Blackwell"" chips.

British banking behemoth Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) has ventured into the stablecoin settlement space with its first-of-a-kind investment in Ubyx, according to a report published Wednesday.

Barclays’ Entry Into Stablecoin Industry?

Barclays bought a stake in Ubyx as part of its plans to explore “new forms of digital money,” Reuters reported.

“As the landscape of tokens, blockchains and wallets evolves, specialist technology will play a pivotal role in delivering connectivity and infrastructure to enable regulated financial institutions to interact seamlessly,” Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays, told Benzinga.

The banking giant said it will collaborate with Ubyx to develop “tokenised money within the regulatory perimeter.”

The exact details of the investment and the valuation were not disclosed.

Ubyx, founded in 2025, is a clearing system that lets anyone deposit stablecoins, from various issuers and currencies, into regular bank or fintech accounts and redeem them. The company’s corporate office is in New York, according to private market financial platform Pitchbook.

Barclays’ Bet On Crypto

This is not Barclays’ first foray into the world of digital currencies. Back in 2015, it became the first major UK bank to accept Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) .

The bank has praised blockchain, the ledger-like technology that powers Bitcoin, as an innovative system that may significantly benefit traditional banking.

Price Action: Barclays shares rose 0.95% in after-hours trading after closing 0.27% lower at $26.25 during Tuesday's regular trading session, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The stock has nearly doubled in value over the past year.

BCS exhibited a very high Momentum score — a measure of the stock’s relative strength based on its price movement patterns and volatility over multiple timeframes. How does it compare with other banking stocks? Visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings to find out.

The “everything bubble” gathered steam as almost every asset price went up, similar to 2023 and 2024. Interestingly, bitcoin was the only major asset that fell last year.

Gold was the standout performer in 2025, up 64% in US dollar terms. The sharp fall in the US currency helped its cause, as did growing concerns about the US budget deficit and easy money. It’s capped what’s been a stellar decade for the yellow metal.

The performance of international stocks also stood out. At this time last year, the biggest mantra in markets was US exceptionalism and seemingly every investor was board. That didn’t pan out as planned with the S&P 500 return of 18% trailing the world index’s 22%, emerging markets’ 33% and Europe’s 35%.

Bonds have been much maligned, though bounced back last year. That led to solid performance for 60/40 stock-bond portfolios.

As seen in the first chart, it’s the third year in a row that 95% of major asset classes have delivered positive annual returns.

Bitcoin was the only asset to finish in the red this year. Its extreme volatility during the April dip quietened talk of it being a ‘safe haven’ or ‘digital gold’.

Breaking down stocks by country, South Korea was the best performing major market, rising 95% in US dollar terms in 2025. The likes of Spain and Greece weren’t far behind.

Overall, the Eurozone was the standout, but Asia also did well. Major Asian markets such Singapore and Japan were up 31% and 26% respectively. Even China, deemed ‘un-investible’ by many at the beginning of last year, bounced 31% to trounce both the World Index and US stocks.

In terms of which styles of stock investments worked best, there was a marked difference between the US and the rest of the world. Outside of America, value stocks beat growth. In the US, it was the opposite.

In the US, it’s hard to believe but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down 19% and 24% respectively for the year through to lows in April. That’s before both came roaring back by year end. Amazingly, the Nasdaq gained 52% from the lows.

What were the key drivers in the US? Company earnings came in better than expected, rising 13% for the year. The rest of the gains came from valuation multiple expansion.

The S&P 500’s trailing price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 26x is well above the historical average of 19.8x. The current multiple was last seen in 2020-2021 before the correction of 2022, and in 1998-2001, when a bear market then followed.

The ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks were frequently quoted in 2025, though their performance didn’t live up to the hype. It was really the Magnificent 2 as only Alphabet and Nvidia outperformed the index.

Alphabet rocketed as the market realised that the extent of its AI capabilities, dampening fears that AI would take out its cash cow, the search business. Meanwhile, Nvidia continued its ascent as demand for its chips showed few signs of slowing down.

Tesla did ok considering its auto volumes continued to shrink as Chinese competitors gained share in electric vehicles.

Valuations for these Magnificent 7 stocks still look punchy.

Despite the mixed performance of the Magnificent 7, technology was still the best performing sector in the US. Notable sector laggards included real estate and consumer facing sectors.

In Australia, stocks underperformed the rest of the world. The ASX 200 rose 7% in 2025, 10% including dividends. That 10% looks poor compared to the returns of other markets, though it’s still in line with the long-term returns from the ASX index.

Delving deeper, it was mid and small caps that thrashed larger stocks, up 18% and 26% respectively. A lot of that outperformance was due to the continued rise in gold equities, and the comeback of lithium plays.

Across the board, materials were the big winner in 2025, while tech and healthcare were the big losers.

Unlike in the US, growth and momentum stocks performed poorly in Australia. Interestingly, quality stocks also trailed the pack.

Quality businesses like CSL, Goodman, REA and CAR Group didn’t live up to expectations. In the case of CSL, that was self-indicted, and in the other cases, it was likely excessive valuations coming back to earth (somewhat).

Commodities: up, up and away

Australian resource stocks were helped by the surge in many commodity prices. In 2025, silver even outdid gold, rising an astonishing 147%. Copper also did well as investors fingered it as a key AI and data centre beneficiary.

On the flip side, oil prices went south as a supply surge overwhelmed tepid demand, leaving large excess inventories.

With the notable exception of beef, agricultural commodities also underperformed.

King dollar no more?

The rise of the US dollar took an abrupt about-turn in 2025. The USD finished the year down 10% on a trade-weighted basis.

Source: Bofa

The Aussie dollar started the year near 62 cents to the US dollar and finished above 67 cents. That was driven by changing expectations for interest rates and inflation. The market now forecasts rate rises in Australia this year. Conversely, in the US, consensus suggests rate falls, especially with a new Trump-friendly Federal Reserve Chairman replacing Jerome Powell by mid this year. Given the differing paths for rates, it wouldn’t surprise to see a further rise in the Aussie versus the USD.

2026 outlook

At this time last year, I suggested that investors should seek to diversify their stock holdings beyond the US and Australia. The primary reason being that other major markets like Europe and Asia were considerably cheaper. That suggestion paid off, not that many Australian-based investors listened as they continued to pile into American markets. I see no little reason why the outperformance of non-US stock markets can’t continue.

American equities have had a remarkable 16 year bull market, with stocks up close to 16% per annum (p.a.), well above their historical 10% p.a. returns. The average US market has lasted around 18 years, which would indicate that we may be in the last leg of this bull market. Most importantly, every valuation metric for US stocks is near or at record highs. Whenever the Shiller PE and trailing PE for America have been at current levels, it’s resulted in flat to low single digit returns on every single occasion throughout history.

In other words, if you’re betting on the US stock market, you really do think this time is different, and that spectacular recent performance can continue. I’m on the other side of that bet.

Where does that leave the ASX? If commodities continue to their ascent, there is a good chance that Australia outperforms the US this year (yes, you read that right). And given my expectations for low single digit returns from US equities over the next decade, I believe the odds favour ASX stocks handily beating their American counterparts over that period.

Drilling down on the ASX, I wrote at the start of last year that a rotation out of miners into banks could happen soon and resource outperformance may then persist for many years to come. That rotation happened in 2025, and I think there’s a high probability for it to continue. The reason being that the banks remain steeply priced and many miners have lagged the rise in commodity prices.

What about bonds and cash? It’s hard to be bullish. Major countries around the world have enormous debt loads and higher inflation is the easiest way to bring these debt levels down to more reasonable levels. And in Australia, interest rates are on the way up, not down.

On the flip side, investor positioning and flows show bonds remain the most hated of the major asset classes. It wouldn’t take much for this to change.

Overall, you’re likely to see pedestrian returns from bonds for 2026 and beyond.

For 60/40 portfolios, that’s not a bad thing, as it should deliver solid overall returns.

Higher expected earnings growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while lower growth or higher uncertainty usually points to a lower one.

Boston Scientific currently trades on a P/E of 52.40x. That sits above both the Medical Equipment industry average of 30.65x and the peer group average of 41.73x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Boston Scientific is 41.28x, which is its estimate of what a more appropriate P/E might be once you factor in elements like earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.

This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming one size fits all. On this basis, Boston Scientific’s current P/E looks higher than its Fair Ratio, which points to an expensive reading on this metric.

As of September 2025, U.S. manufacturing payrolls totaled 12.7 million workers, down from 17.2 million in 2000, even as productivity has risen sharply.","Ralph Lauren and the Council of Fashion Designers of America is widening its financial commitment to domestic apparel production as new economic data underscore just how fragile American fashion manufacturing has become.

This week, the CFDA announced two new grant programs aimed at stabilizing and modernizing U.S.-based fashion manufacturing, extending its support well beyond New York City for the first time. The move comes as fresh analysis from Deloitte shows that apparel and textile manufacturing remain among the fastest-declining segments of the U.S. industrial economy, even as policymakers push to reshore production.

The first initiative, the CFDA x NY Forward Grant Fund, is a city-focused effort developed with funding from the New York State Department of State and Ralph Lauren Corp. It will provide partially matching grants to designers and manufacturers operating in New York City’s Garment District, an area that has steadily lost factories and skilled labor over the past two decades.

The second program, the U.S. Fashion Manufacturing Fund, represents a broader national expansion. Also created with Ralph Lauren as a founding partner, the new fund will operate from 2027 through 2029 and support manufacturers across key apparel-producing regions including California, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Florida. The program is structured to cover 80 percent of eligible investments, with recipients contributing the remaining 20 percent, and is designed to help manufacturers upgrade machinery, adopt advanced software, and invest in workforce training.

Rather than attempting to recreate the labor-intensive apparel sector that once defined American manufacturing, the CFDA is directing capital toward higher-value, technology-enabled production that can survive within a dramatically changed global economy.

“Strengthening American manufacturing to ensure designers have local partners has long been at the core of CFDA’s mission,” Steven Kolb, chief executive officer and president of the CFDA, said in a statement. “We are proud to extend our decade-plus work with Ralph Lauren Corp. and expand to a national level while also continuing our local NYC investments alongside our first-ever partnership with the New York State Department of State.”

Ralph Lauren Corp. has been a central financial backer of the CFDA’s manufacturing efforts since 2013, when the organization launched its Fashion Manufacturing Initiative in partnership with the New York City Economic Development Corp. and industry executive Andrew Rosen. To date, Ralph Lauren has contributed $2 million as the initiative’s premier underwriter, enabling grants to 54 factories and supporting more than 2,000 jobs.

“Our expanded partnership with the CFDA reflects Ralph Lauren’s enduring commitment to advancing innovation and supporting American fashion,” said Katie Ioanilli, chief global impact and communications officer at Ralph Lauren Corp. “This is not only an investment in our industry — it’s an investment in a vital part of American culture that we share with the world.”

The renewed focus on modernization and training arrives as long-term economic trends continue to weigh heavily on apparel production. According to Deloitte’s Economics Insider series, real gross value added in U.S. manufacturing has grown at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent since 2000, compared with 2.1 percent growth across the broader economy. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. economic output stood at 9.4 percent in the second quarter of 2025, down from 15.1 percent 25 years earlier.

Within that contraction, apparel and textiles have been hit particularly hard. Deloitte data show that output in textile mills and textile product manufacturing has declined by an average of 2.9 percent per year since 2000, while apparel, leather, and allied products have fallen by an average of 2.2 percent annually. Employment losses have been even steeper, with apparel payrolls shrinking at an average rate of 6.8 percent per year over the same period.

By contrast, capital-intensive manufacturing sectors such as computer and electronic products have posted strong output growth, reinforcing a reality that CFDA leaders appear to be acknowledging: future domestic fashion manufacturing will depend less on scale and more on specialization, automation, and advanced skills.

The structure of the new grant programs mirrors that shift. Both funds are explicitly designed to help companies modernize equipment, expand technical services, and train workers in advanced production methods rather than increase headcount alone. The CFDA x NY Forward Grant Fund will distribute two rounds of funding in 2026 and 2027, with one manufacturer in each round also receiving the Ralph Lauren Manufacturing Award, which covers the full grant amount in recognition of innovation.

New York State remains a focal point. In 2024, the state’s fashion industry was responsible for approximately $25 billion in wages, with New York City accounting for roughly $20 billion annually. Statewide, fashion employs about 315,000 people, including 204,000 jobs based in the city.

Ralph Lauren has also continued to anchor portions of its own production domestically, particularly through its role as Official Outfitter of Team USA. The company manufactures parade ceremony uniforms in the United States, including the opening and closing ceremony looks for the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games, work that has supported multiple American factories.

When asked about the potential for expanding U.S. production further, the company said, “We continue to explore and build additional opportunities to manufacture our products in the U.S. We value the wide range of production solutions that U.S. manufacturers can offer, from heritage craftsmanship to high-tech manufacturing like 3D printing. However, increasing domestic manufacturing is a complex process that requires ongoing collaboration across our sector, from how we collectively source raw materials to increasing existing domestic factory capacity to talent availability.”

The company added, “Working with factories across the country, we produce hundreds of thousands of products across all of our brands in the U.S.”

Deloitte’s analysis suggests that this kind of selective, high-value domestic production is likely to define the sector’s future. While tariffs and trade policy have renewed political interest in reshoring, the firm notes that manufacturing growth now hinges more on skilled labor, automation, and productivity than on sheer employment. As of September 2025, U.S. manufacturing payrolls totaled 12.7 million workers, down from 17.2 million in 2000, even as productivity has risen sharply.",https://wordpress-1228073-4378900.cloudwaysapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ethos-logo-295x295.png,N,,2026-01-08 00:02:35.340468

Have you ever thought that due to problems such as uneven pressure and missed areas, even with the most careful brushing, the cleaning effect may be greatly reduced? As the main culprit of oral health problems, the hidden accumulation of dental plaque not only tends to cause issues after the frequent delicious food gatherings during the New Year, but also poses a long-term potential threat to overall health. A truly efficient cleaning requires not only daily persistence but also the correct method. Especially during the New Year when the diet is diverse and social activities are frequent, it is not only a guarantee for maintaining current confidence but also a long-term health investment for yourself, your relatives, friends, and loved ones.

Philips electric toothbrushes are centered around 33 years of professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology. Through the efficient relay transmission of kinetic energy by the ""brush bristles - brush head - motor"" three-in-one system, they drive micro-bubble water flow to clean about 40% more hard-to-reach areas such as tooth gaps. The newly launched Diamond Smart Navigation Toothbrush, on the basis of its professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology, deeply integrates a 360° smart voice navigation system and is equipped with record-level bone conduction acoustic technology. During navigation, the sound is three-dimensional and clear, and the instructions are clear and easy to understand. It provides comprehensive guidance and error correction at every stage before, during, and after toothbrushing. Combined with the real-time sensitive induction of Soni-sense sensor technology, it can precisely detect and instantly remind users of inappropriate toothbrushing behaviors such as toothbrushing pressure, toothbrushing time, toothbrushing speed, as well as overpressure, horizontal brushing, and missed areas without interrupting the toothbrushing process and can provide real-time guidance. Users don't need to study the complex Bass toothbrushing method. By following the voice navigation, they can effectively remove dental plaque five times more effectively. Whether it's young people who pursue intelligence and efficiency or the elderly who value simplicity of operation, they can easily master it. Long-term use will help form correct oral cleaning habits.

It has a long battery life, so you can take it with you during your travels and say goodbye to battery anxiety.

The grand launch of this new product marks the iterative upgrade and innovative breakthrough of Philips' professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology. Currently, there are a wide variety of smart toothbrushes on the market. Although some products have voice prompt functions, most of them still remain at the level of simple function stacking. The birth of the Philips Diamond Smart Navigation Toothbrush stems from a deep exploration of the essence of ""effective cleaning"" - true intelligence should not just be superficial notification but rather systematically solving the fundamental pain points of ""incomplete cleaning and incorrect brushing"" and establishing long-term correct oral cleaning habits. The smart navigation toothbrush is Philips' first globally product that deeply integrates 33 years of professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology, Soni-sense sensor technology, and a 360° closed-loop navigation system, achieving an upgrade from a single ""cleaning tool"" to a systematic ""long-term dental steward"".

In the new year, Philips will continue to use professional health technology to lay a foundation for the oral health of the public. It is not only responsible for every current cleaning but also cares about and protects the long-term health of the public. A smart navigation toothbrush that provides long-term, scientific, and systematic guidance is becoming a more forward-looking health gift choice for the New Year, helping consumers improve their quality of health in the new year.","https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260107/v2_881bfc4881244262a3d4e73cd612b782@6288861_oswg112959oswg1053oswg495_img_jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,w_600,h_400,limit_0/crop,w_600,h_400,g_center",N,,2026-01-08 00:02:24.980568

“Part of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,” Gonzalez Rogers said.
A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.
One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred.
Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred.","A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise now valued at $500 billion.

Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.

“This case is going to trial,” Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.

The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.

But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk — the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion — against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.

“Part of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,” Gonzalez Rogers said.

It's unclear when the judge will schedule the trial.

The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.

Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.

At that point, Musk began to suspect that Altman and another OpenAI executive, Greg Brockman, might be plotting to transform the research lab into a profit-seeking company, according to evidence submitted to the the judge.

Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.

A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.

In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, “We’ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,” according to court filings.

At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.

One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.

Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/91208738-2234-45cc-ab81-c2a4c090114d/wirestory_ee5bfbc14c2be20906886a9ae1d2cb20_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-07 20:13:50.605678

It was a ray of light in an otherwise gloomy set of statistics in the latest bellwether S&P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index which registered 40.1 in December, up from 39.4 in November but below the neutral 50.0 value for the twelfth successive month.

UK construction companies experienced another sharp downturn in business activity and incoming new work at the end of 2025.

But rates of contraction eased from the five-and- a-half year records seen in November while the improvement in business activity expectations hit the highest

level since July.

Around 37% of the survey panel predict a rise in output levels during the year ahead, compared to 20% that forecast a decline.

Tim Moore, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Total new orders decreased to a much lesser degree than in November, while business activity expectations for the year ahead rebounded to a five- month high.

“Some survey respondents attributed greater optimism to projections of rising infrastructure spending, especially in the utilities sector. There were also hopes

that lower borrowing costs and easing inflationary pressures could boost demand across the construction sector.”

Brian Smith, head of cost management at AECOM said: “As today’s figures show, things are starting to improve for contractors and January will all be about positioning themselves to gradually expand capacity and be on the front foot to win new work when it comes.

“Everything points towards a further slowdown in inflation and cuts in interest rates to match this year, which will embolden clients and developers to kickstart schemes left on the back burner.”",https://www.constructionenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-11.21.09-1200x828.png,N,,2026-01-08 01:58:04.121377

During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.

Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.

One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.

“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”

Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations.

The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.

“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”

Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.

Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs.

During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.

“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ces-caterpillar.jpg?resize=1200,900",N,,2026-01-07 19:03:23.380905

On December 30, Barclays raised its price target on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to $217 from $197 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The firm reviewed sales and prescription data through the final week of December and sees room for upside to Q4 consensus estimates. The strength is coming mainly from Darzalex, Tremfya, and Simponi. Based on that trend, Barclays lifted its estimates ahead of the earnings release.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) continues to generate strong free cash flow, even as it spends heavily on research and development. R&D investment reached $10.4 billion through the third quarter, putting the company among the largest investors in innovation globally. That cash flow also gives it flexibility on the deal side. Recently, the company closed its $3.1 billion acquisition of Halda Therapeutics, which brings a new platform aimed at advancing cancer treatment. Management expects these investments to support steady revenue and earnings growth, reinforcing the company’s ability to keep raising its dividend, which currently yields about 2.5%.

Oncology remains a core strength. Johnson & Johnson is one of the largest players in the space, with key products such as Rybrevant, an intravenous infusion, and Lazcluze, a once-daily pill. Used together, they target advanced non-small cell lung cancer with specific EGFR mutations. Inlexzo, developed for bladder cancer, is also expected to add momentum to the oncology portfolio.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and its subsidiaries focus on the research, development, manufacturing, and sale of a wide range of healthcare products across global markets.

Passengers At Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Have Faced Multiple Cancellations For Delta Air Lines Flights Cancellations for Delta Air Lines were 18 yesterday.","Delta Air Lines continues to pivot amid delays and cancellations at its major hubs worldwide. At the end of the year, Delta was forced to delay flights after ""crew duty time was exhausted"" as cancellations piled up at its biggest hub, Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta.

To start the year, Delta has still been forced into making flight adjustments. That recently occurred due to the FAA restricting airspace over several Caribbean destinations. Although Delta resumed flights when the airspace closure was lifted, cancellations continued.

Now, Delta is facing yet another setback, this time at one of its major European hubs. Due to winter weather and de-icing issues, this airport has faced hundreds of cancellations over the last couple of days, including flights operated by Delta.

Here's a closer look at the latest and how Delta passengers have responded to the issues.

Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Is Cancelling At Least 700 Flights On Wednesday Due To Snow, Wind And De-Icing Issues

The nightmare experience has continued for passengers flying out of Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. One of the largest hubs in Europe, Delta Air Lines has several flights out of the international airport per day. Last year, Delta had up to 17 daily non-stop flights to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Delta generally uses the concourses E, F and G at the airport.

However, due to snow and strong winds, along with several issues de-icing aircraft, the airport has experienced widespread disruptions, to the point that more than 1,000 passengers spent the night there, forced to sleep at the international hub.

The airport has issued a statement, warning passengers that more cancellations are expected.

The airport wrote, ""On Wednesday, due to persistent winter weather and heavy winds, only limited air traffic is possible to and from Schiphol. As a precaution, more than 700 flights are cancelled. More cancellations are expected. This will be mostly European flights.""

Although the warning states mostly European flights will be affected, the same has held true for flights to the United States.

Passengers at the airport claim they've been delayed by 36 hours in extreme cases for Delta Air Lines flights.

Passengers At Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Have Faced Multiple Cancellations For Delta Air Lines Flights

Cancellations for Delta Air Lines were 18 yesterday. However, they have already increased on Wednesday.

KLM is still the airline most affected by the AMS cancellations, with 430 cancelled flights.

U.S. passengers in Amsterdam have been affected by the cancellations. One passenger saw their flight cancelled repeatedly over the last 36 hours.

They wrote online, ""So I am one of those 'un' lucky passengers stuck in Amsterdam for a better part of a week. My connecting flight to the US was cancelled on the tarmac.""

""Yesterday I got another flight for the 6th. At 11 PM that flight gets cancelled. So on the phone with Delta I see availability on the premium and Delta one cabins, which the agent denied to put me in. They give me a flight for the 7th, more then 36 hours.""

Even 36 hours later, the traveler was forced to arrive at the airport early to see if there was any space on the flight. Thankfully, there was.

The passenger added, ""After about 30 minutes I am talking to an agent and I plea for any last minute openings. She finds one right away on the direct flight, leaving in 2 hours. After 30 minutes on hold with Delta, she gets me an isle seat. WHAT? This is a delta flight!!!! So I open the Delta app and what do I see. For that flight 177 open seats, 70 in the premium cabins.

""So either the app is not correct or Delta is flying half empty planes while paying hotels and meals for stranded passengers. At the very least, Delta's systems are really messed up.""

The passenger was finally able to make it on the Delta flight after exhausting cancellations over 36 hours.

The Current Delays And Cancellation Totals

As it stands on Wednesday afternoon, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport had by far the most flight cancellations worldwide. The airport has 324 cancellations on departing flights, along with 287 for arrivals, according to FlightAware. The cancellations are higher for departing flights due to the ongoing issues of de-icing the planes.

As for Delta Air Lines, the carrier has increased cancellations from yesterday to 20. This is currently the highest among all U.S. airlines.

There are currently 124 cancelled flights within, into or out of the United States, as of Wednesday afternoon.

The intrigue: The expansion keeps ABIA well ahead of rival San Antonio International Airport, which is also undergoing an expansion to give it up to 40 gates total.
The airport expansion is ""a tremendous economic opportunity for Austin — not only through the trades and construction jobs created during the buildout, but also through long-term jobs in concessions, airport operations, and airline services after the program is complete,"" Vanessa Fuentes, the Austin City Council member who represents the area, said in a statement.","Austin officials have firmed up the money for a massive expansion at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport — with plans to nearly double the number of gates.

The federal government has committed at least $200 million to the project so far.

The airport currently has 34 gates. Officials announced Wednesday that they'll add 32 more gates.

Driving the news: City officials said they inked new lease contracts with Southwest, Delta, United, American and Alaska airlines, along with FedEx, and UPS. The 10-year contracts will provide major revenue certainty for the airport as it embarks on the ambitious expansion project.

The contracts spell out airline fees for runways, ticket counters, gates, baggage systems and aircraft parking positions, among other things.

Airlines that are not signatories will pay per-use charges for those services.

Follow the money: City officials expect to pull in roughly $250 million in revenue from the airlines this fiscal year — more than half of its total revenue — and $275 million next fiscal year, according to a city budget document from August.

Zoom in: The money will help pay for the redevelopment of the existing Barbara Jordan Terminal, as well as:

A new pedestrian bridge connecting parking garages and the rental car facility.

A new and expanded baggage claim hall.

A new centralized TSA security checkpoint.

New expanded airline ticket counters.

And the new gates, split between two new concourses.

The intrigue: The expansion keeps ABIA well ahead of rival San Antonio International Airport, which is also undergoing an expansion to give it up to 40 gates total.

The two airports have competed for international flights and other routes in recent years.

What they're saying: The commitment from the airlines ""provides the financial foundation we need to modernize our facilities, transform customer experience, and build the infrastructure needed to support Central Texas' continued growth for generations to come,"" airport CEO Ghizlane Badawi said in a statement.

The airport expansion is ""a tremendous economic opportunity for Austin — not only through the trades and construction jobs created during the buildout, but also through long-term jobs in concessions, airport operations, and airline services after the program is complete,"" Vanessa Fuentes, the Austin City Council member who represents the area, said in a statement.

What's next: The lion's share of the new gates won't open till the early 2030s.",https://images.axios.com/mHgyJXJOEmdBRBK88k40T3TqNlE=/0x0:3600x2025/1366x768/2026/01/07/1767820440849.jpeg,N,,2026-01-07 19:03:05.934086

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK construction purchasing managers' index rose to 40.1 points in December from 39.4 in November, but was below the expected 42.3 points.

The PMI remained below the 50.0 neutral mark separating growth from contraction for the 12th consecutive month, with its second-lowest reading since May 2020.

Tim Moore, S&P Global Market Intelligence's economics director, commented: ""UK construction companies once again reported challenging business conditions and falling workloads in December, but the speed of the downturn moderated from the five-and-a-half-year record seen in November. Many firms cited subdued demand and fragile client confidence.

""Despite a lifting of Budget-related uncertainty, delayed spending decisions were still cited as contributing to weak sales pipelines at the close of the year.""

Moore noted: ""Total new orders nonetheless decreased to a much lesser degree than in November, while business activity expectations for the year ahead rebounded to a five-month high.""

S&P Global said approximately 37% of the survey panel predicted that output will increase in the year ahead, while 20% predicted a decline.

""Some survey respondents attributed greater optimism to projections of rising infrastructure spending, especially in the utilities sector,"" Moore said. ""There were also hopes that lower borrowing costs and easing inflationary pressures could boost demand across the construction sector.""

The UK construction PMI is compiled by S&P Global from questionnaire responses by a panel of about 150 construction companies.

The data was collected between December 4 and 22.

But as Scientific American and many other outlets have previously reported, some health experts have urged caution when using ChatGPT for health care reasons—and especially for mental health. The company has faced legal scrutiny in recent years after several people, including at least two teenagers, died by suicide after interacting with ChatGPT. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other experts are more positive. Peter D. Chang, an associate professor of radiological sciences and computer science at the University of California, Irvine, says the tool represents a “step in the right direction” toward more personalized medical care. But he also cautions that users should approach any AI-generated medical advice with a grain of salt. “Maybe don’t do exactly what it says but use it as a starting point to learn more.”

“Absolutely there’s nothing preventing the model from going off the rails to give you a nonsensical result,” Chang says.

Growth outlook strengthens as acquisition talks and partnerships advance

Eli Lilly is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire Ventyx Biosciences in a deal valued at over $1 billion, which is expected to expand its drug portfolio, especially in inflammatory disease treatments. The potential acquisition could further bolster growth prospects within the company’s pipeline. Recent news also highlights Lilly’s projected revenue gains and strategic partnerships focused on new oral therapies.

Overbought signals emerge as buyers press against resistance

Momentum remains clearly positive, with both MACD and ADX signaling bullish strength on the daily chart. RSI at 55.78 suggests bullish but not overbought conditions, though both Stochastic RSI and Bull/Bear Power flag emerging overbought zones and strong buyer dominance intraday. The Awesome Oscillator is neutral. Today’s session opened with a modest upward gap, and the price is currently near the session’s high. Intraday volatility is moderate, with a clear upward tone as buyers continue to exert pressure after the open. Some divergence is noted with oscillators reflecting mounting overbought signals even as momentum remains robust, so caution is warranted as price approaches potential exhaustion levels. Nearest support is seen at the Ichimoku Kijun ($1,036.88), with next dynamic resistance aligning near the 50-day Moving Average and the round $1,100–$1,110 zone.

Breakout risks climb as upward bias meets volatility zone

Over the next five trading days, LLY is likely to trade within a $1,075 to $1,125 volatility band relative to current levels. The probability of further upward movement is high (over 80%), while the chances of a meaningful pullback remain low. The baseline scenario sees price consolidating around $1,100, but a sustained bullish push could trigger a breakout above $1,125, whereas heightened selling might test support near $1,075. Multi-timeframe momentum continues to favor buyers, though short-term volatility risks persist as overbought readings intensify.

Previously it was reported that Eli Lilly and Company is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, consistently trading above key moving averages across all timeframes, with technical indicators such as MACD and ADX in buy territory and RSI remaining bullish without reaching overbought levels. The stock is supported near $1,035–$1,040 and faces resistance around $1,095–$1,100, while momentum and institutional activity suggest further upside is likely despite some mixed oscillator signals.",https://files.tradersunion.com/images/analytics-news/eli-lilly/eli-lilly_01.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 17:02:42.464565

ChatGPT Health is not intended for diagnosis and treatment, and it's not supposed to replace medical care, OpenAI said. Rather, the experience is supposed to help users navigate everyday questions, and it aims make ChatGPT's responses more relevant by grounding them in a user's own health information.

""ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,"" Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, wrote in a post on Substack.

OpenAI said ChatGPT Health has its own dedicated space within the chatbot, so all of those files, conversations and connected apps are stored separately from other chats. Information and memories from ChatGPT Health will not flow outside of that space, and those conversations will not be used to train OpenAI's foundation models, the company said.

The startup has partnered with b.well, which provides the health data connectivity infrastructure that will allow users to share their medical records with ChatGPT Health.

Users will also be able to connect to Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, the lab testing startup Function and other data. Services can be connected from tools or apps in settings.

ChatGPT Health was developed in ""close collaboration"" with physicians, OpenAI said.

OpenAI has deepened its push into health care in recent months.

After the company launched its GPT-5 model in August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC that health care was ""maybe the area where there's the strongest improvement of any category.""

In May, it released a benchmark called Health Bench that is designed to measure how well AI models perform in realistic health scenarios.

The startup said Wednesday that ""hundreds of millions"" of people ask health and wellness questions each week.

ChatGPT Health will initially be made available to a small group of early users that will offer feedback and refine the experience. OpenAI said it will expand access in the coming weeks.

BALTIMORE and SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- OpenAI has selected b.well as the underlying health data connectivity infrastructure enabling users to securely connect their medical records for more personalized health AI interactions in ChatGPT Health.

Through this collaboration, users can explicitly authorize access within ChatGPT to securely connect their health data and medical records from U.S. healthcare providers. This enables health-related conversations in ChatGPT Health to be grounded in a user's own longitudinal health information, delivering more relevant, context-aware insights. The integration is designed to put consumers in charge of where and how they can safely and securely access their health information.

""One of the most common and meaningful ways people use ChatGPT today is for health and wellness information,"" said Ashley Alexander, VP of Health Products, OpenAI. ""By working with trusted brands like b.well, we're able to make the user experience even more useful and personalized.""

b.well operates a highly connected health data network designed to support consumer-mediated access to live clinical data across more than 2.2 million providers and 320 health plans, labs, and other sources. Built on FHIR-based APIs and trusted healthcare exchange frameworks, the network maintains strict controls around identity verification, consent management, data security, and auditability.

""We know patients are already using ChatGPT for health information and advice. Allowing patients to securely and privately integrate their own health data will make those interactions much more contextually relevant and accurate,"" said Kristen Valdes, CEO and Founder of b.well. ""b.well was built to make healthcare simpler for consumers and their families. We're excited that this collaboration meets consumers where they are — talking to ChatGPT — and brings more personalized interactions so they can better engage in their health and well-being.""

OpenAI is leveraging b.well's SDK for Health AI to activate this connectivity and accelerate the delivery of AI-driven health experiences.

The b.well SDK for Health AI transforms connected health data into clean, aggregated, AI-optimized inputs for large language model (LLM) applications, enabling organizations to deploy and scale AI-driven health experiences in weeks rather than months or years. The SDK supports secure use of both structured and unstructured clinical data — including patient summaries, lab and vital trends, clinical notes such as progress notes and discharge summaries, diagnostic interpretations, care plans, and coverage information — while optimizing data delivery for performance, cost efficiency, and fast response times. This approach allows AI systems to generate answers in seconds, even when working with years of longitudinal patient records.

""Today, AI is only able to work across a small part of the patient record. The b.well Health SDK for AI finally enables AI to work across the full patient record — spanning multiple EMRs and with complete access to both structured data and unstructured data,"" said Imran Qureshi, Chief AI and Technology Officer at b.well. ""We are excited about the power of combining OpenAI's industry-leading AI with b.well's industry-first AI SDK to help consumers make informed decisions about their health.""

The work with OpenAI reflects a broader industry shift toward B2B health infrastructure models — where AI and consumer platforms rely on proven interoperability networks rather than building healthcare connectivity from scratch. By leveraging b.well's existing network, OpenAI can accelerate development while aligning with U.S. healthcare data standards and privacy regulations.

This announcement builds on b.well's growing role as foundational infrastructure for technology companies integrating health data into consumer experiences, following similar work with major global technology leaders.

Uber shares have fallen about 17% since late September, leaving the valuation near last year’s lows despite what the analysts see as limited near-term competitive impact from AVs.

Jefferies wrote that the selloff echoes late 2024, when similar fears preceded a sharp rally. They added that the multiple has returned to levels that previously paved the way for an approximately 70% rally through much of 2025.

The analysts contend that AV adoption will have “nearly zero impact on growth through 2027,” as Uber’s expansion increasingly depends on markets outside San Francisco, where autonomous testing has been concentrated.

They estimate that even with Waymo’s rapid progress, the impact on Uber’s bookings growth will be negligible relative to overall demand growth.

Waymo reported about 450,000 paid rides per week in December and is targeting one million weekly rides by the end of 2026. Even at that scale, Jefferies estimates Waymo would account for roughly 1.2% of US rideshare volume, translating into headwinds of just 0.07% and 0.11% to Uber’s bookings growth in 2026 and 2027, respectively. “Which pales in comparison to overall growth in the high-teens,” the analysts wrote.

Investor attention has also shifted toward Tesla’s autonomous ambitions, which some view as a greater long-term threat due to its manufacturing capacity.

However, Jefferies argues that economics remain a constraint. “Our analysis shows that even after reaching scale in 5+ years, a standalone AV fleet would still have costs per trip that are slightly above rideshare,” the analysts wrote, citing lower utilization and the need to build capacity for peak demand.

Against that backdrop, Jefferies sees Uber as well-positioned to benefit rather than be displaced by AVs. “Over the past two years, UBER has grown its stable of AV partnerships to over 20, creating an ecosystem that reduces reliance on any single provider,” the analysts wrote.

They added that Uber’s large user base and fleet management expertise should help it integrate autonomous supply while maintaining an asset-light model.

Jefferies maintained a $120 price target on Uber, implying roughly 40% upside from current levels, and said it expects durable mobility growth and continued progress on AV partnerships to drive the shares higher despite near-term headline risk.

ID20,HP Inc,2026-01-07 19:48:44+00:00,Engadget,HP's new EliteBoard made me believe in keyboard computers again - Engadget,Devindra Hardawar,,,,,https://www.engadget.com/computing/hps-new-eliteboard-made-me-believe-in-keyboard-computers-again-033000022.html,"A keyboard computer has always been on my wishlist — that is, a computer where the entire machine was stuffed into a keyboard.
It turns out putting an entire computer behind a screen was more compelling than stuffing them into a keyboard.
Sadly, the overall setup was a jumble of wires, and not the clean layout I expected from a keyboard PC.
Once I was able to start up Windows though, I was less annoyed and more amazed that the keyboard contained an entire computer.
While the EliteBoard is targeted at commercial users, HP is considering it an experiment to see how people respond to a keyboard PC.","A keyboard computer has always been on my wishlist — that is, a computer where the entire machine was stuffed into a keyboard. Perhaps I caught a glimpse of the Commodore 64 at an impressionable age, but regardless, the idea has always been intriguing to me. At CES 2026, HP is bringing that concept back with the new EliteBoard G1a, which is dubbed a “Next Gen AI PC.”

It's an IT administrator's dream: It looks a typical desktop keyboard, but it has the full power of a Copilot+ AI PC inside. You can equip it with Ryzen 5 or 7 CPUs and their embedded Radeon 800 GPUs, up to 64GB of RAM and as much as 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. All you need to do is add a monitor and a mouse, and you've got a full-fledged desktop setup.

The more I think about it, the more sad I am that the arc of the computing industry trended towards standardized desktops and laptops. There was a brief spark of interest with the UMPC (ultra mobile PC) trend in the 2000's, which Engadget covered extensively as a young blog, as well as ASUS's Eee keyboard. But they couldn't survive the rise of the smartphone and tablet. It turns out putting an entire computer behind a screen was more compelling than stuffing them into a keyboard.

I was able to test out an early EliteBoard prototype, and while the experience wasn't perfect, it's still an intriguing computing option. I had trouble setting it up initially because it only had two USB-C ports on its rear, which meant I had to find a way to power it through one port and pass a video signal through the other. Thankfully, my Anker USB-C charging hub was able to juice it up, and I also had a USB-C hub with an HDMI port, which allowed me to connect to my monitor.

Sadly, the overall setup was a jumble of wires, and not the clean layout I expected from a keyboard PC. Once I was able to start up Windows though, I was less annoyed and more amazed that the keyboard contained an entire computer. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised, as Intel's Compute Stick placed a functional PC in a much smaller case, but unlike the failed product, the EliteBoard actually felt usable. I was able to load up several browser windows with tabs, edit a few photos and even play a few light games, like Vampire Survivors. And yes, typing on it felt pretty great too.

Since I was testing out prototype hardware, I agreed not to benchmark the EliteBoard. But from the performance I saw, it felt about the same an entry-level laptop. Basically, it's perfectly suited to its main task: Being a boring office computer. Back in my IT days, I certainly would have preferred deploying a few light keyboards instead of the tank-like Dell desktops we typically ordered.

While the EliteBoard is targeted at commercial users, HP is considering it an experiment to see how people respond to a keyboard PC. There's a chance we could see one that's eventually meant for mainstream consumers. I'm not sure if that's exactly, necessary, though. The whole concept of a desktop PC mainly appeals to tinkerers and IT folks. And for anyone who wants to get their hands on an EliteBoard soon, there's really nothing stopping you.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9FzrEqYh99.2zeZe5jHYIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MTk-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:14.631138

If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.

An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Press release from the issuing company:

This week at CES 2026, HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) debuted new technologies that position personal fulfilment as the next frontier for driving business growth. Knowledge workers worldwide are feeling under pressure; just 20% have a healthy relationship with work. But given the right tools and technology, the likelihood of workers having a healthy work relationship more than doubles – and increases five-fold when the workforce sees their company investing in them. In an era marked by disruption and change, HP recognizes a growing fulfilment deficit in the workforce and is committed to empowering organizations to transform this challenge into an opportunity for innovation and resilience.

HP Innovations Designed for the Future of Work

As businesses navigate unprecedented challenges, HP remains steadfast in its commitment to pioneering solutions that foster professional fulfilment and accelerate business growth, ensuring that the future of work is both human-centered and technology-driven.

Delivering AI-powered productivity right at the printer, HP introduced the first integration of Microsoft Copilot into HP Office Print devices with HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot, providing document summarization, translation, and smart organization to help businesses work faster, smarter, and more securely.

Keep hybrid work running smoothly and strengthen IT’s ability to maintain business continuity across distributed environments with enhancements to the company’s Workforce Experience Platform (WXP) employee device management features.

Pair your new HP PC with intuitive, ergonomic, and sustainable peripherals for every workspace, including a stylish pink version of the HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M, a new compact USB-C HP 65W GaN Wall Charger, lightweight and durable HP Protective Series laptop sleeves, and more.

Cole will be CEO-Designate as of January 19, 2026, and will officially assume the CEO role on February 16, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) said in a statement on Tuesday (January 6).

Cole will succeed Andy Mooney, who led Fender as CEO since 2015 and will be retiring.

Mooney leaves Fender after more than a decade in the CEO role, leading the company through a period of technological innovation that included the launch of subscription-based digital software.

Fender launched the Fender Play app – an online learning platform for guitars and other string instruments – in 2017. In 2025, the company launched Fender Studio, an app for recording music and jamming.

Cole has been with Fender since 2015, most recently serving as President of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, a role in which he led a number of initiatives including the launch of Fender’s APAC headquarters in Tokyo and launching the first-ever Fender flagship store in Harajuku, Tokyo, in 2023.

Fender credits Cole with expanding the company’s presence in 14 APAC markets.

“Bud has been one of the most impactful leaders within our organization. He has a deep understanding of the Fender brand, our global players, and the commercial and operational foundation required to propel us into the future,” said Mark Fukunaga, Executive Chairman of the FMIC Board.

“His track record of building teams, expanding markets, and elevating Fender’s presence around the world makes him uniquely qualified to lead the next chapter of growth. On behalf of the Board, I also want to thank Andy Mooney for his leadership over the past decade and for the significant contributions he has made to the company.”

“[Cole’s] track record of building teams, expanding markets, and elevating Fender’s presence around the world makes him uniquely qualified to lead the next chapter of growth.”

Mark Fukunaga, Fender

“Leading Fender has been a highlight of my career. I’m deeply grateful for the creativity and commitment of the Fender teams around the world and proud of what we’ve accomplished,” Mooney said in a statement.

“I’m excited to pass the baton on to Bud and confident that under his leadership, Fender will continue to inspire players for generations to come.”

Prior to joining Fender, Cole held senior leadership roles at Pernod Ricard Group, LVMH, QVC, and Ralph Lauren, building a globally focused career that has seen him work in some 60 countries.

Fender stresses that Cole is a lifelong musician whose first guitar was an acoustic Fender La Brea, followed by a Fender Made-in-Japan 1969 Thinline Telecaster reissue purchased in 1989, which Cole still plays today.

A graduate of Arizona State University, Cole’s first job interview out of college was for a PR position at Fender – a role he didn’t land. That makes his eventual appointment as CEO “especially meaningful,” Fender said.

Founded in 1946, FMIC will celebrate its 80th anniversary this year. Along with the Fender brand, the company owns and operates Squier, Gretsch guitars, Jackson, EVH, Charvel, Bigsby, and PreSonus.",https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2026/01/Edward-Bud-Cole-Fender-Musical-Instruments-Corporation-CEO-Designate-Photo-Credit_-Naoki-Tsuruta-.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:34.880022

Texas-based H-E-B placed first for the fifth time in nine years. Market Basket ranked second for the second time, while Wisconsin-based Woodman’s entered the rankings for the first time and placed third, replacing Costco in the ranking. It marks the first time the top three retailers in the index are all regional chains.

Costco ranked fourth, followed by Aldi, WinCo Foods, Trader Joe’s, Amazon, Wegmans and ShopRite, rounding out the top 10.

Walmart, which owns over 20% of the market share in the grocery industry, finished 11th, and its warehouse retailer, Sam’s Club, was 14th. Publix was 13th and Kroger was 18th.

Woodman’s rise to third place was attributed to strong performance in price, promotions and rewards, as well as quality and operations. Amazon, which ranked first in 2021 and 2022, fell two spots, while Sam’s Club dropped six places. Dunnhumby said the declines were linked in part to a reduced emphasis on digital capabilities in the 2025 rankings and weaker performance on price and quality measures.

The study found that 41% of a retailer’s long-term success is tied to customers’ perception of savings through pricing, promotions and rewards, an increase of three percentage points from last year and the highest level recorded. It remained the most influential factor among five customer perception measures used in the index.

“2025 threw a lot of curveballs at the U.S. consumer,” said Matt O’Grady of dunnhumby, citing concerns about higher prices, fewer job opportunities and stagnant wages. He said shoppers across income levels are becoming more price conscious.

The Retailer Preference Index combines financial performance with customer perception data. It evaluates 81 retailers that sell food and everyday household items. Financial data is provided by Flywheel, while customer perception data is drawn from a dunnhumby survey of more than 11,000 U.S. grocery shoppers. The five factors measured are price, promotions and rewards; quality; digital capabilities; operations; and speed and convenience.

The report found that U.S. consumers place a higher priority on saving money on groceries than consumers in other developed countries, according to a global dunnhumby analysis that referenced data from the Social Progress Imperative. Dunnhumby’s Consumer Trends Tracker showed that 56% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency expense, a figure that has worsened since December 2024. The study also estimated that 58 million Americans experience food insecurity and occasionally skip meals because of affordability concerns.

The analysis noted a narrowing gap between price-focused retailers and traditional grocers on perceptions of quality, particularly among chains such as Walmart and Aldi. As a result, quality has become a more prominent competitive factor alongside price.

Retailers in the top quarter of the rankings outperformed competitors in grocery revenue growth over the past year and the past five years and gained long-term market share, according to the report.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/bltf8f74c7051c741b9/695ead361ea87d090e625ebf/The_newest_H-E-B_store_in_the_Dallas_market_in_Prosper_Texas.webp?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-07 21:00:28.147109

Impact of Marketing Investments on 2025 Holiday Season

Sales generated through consumers visiting a retail site from social media increased 40.3% year over year, with social media generating 4.6% of holiday revenue, up from 3.3% of revenue in 2024. This is separate from social media influencers, which generated one in five online holiday purchases (20.4% of sales from affiliates and partners) up from 17.6% share of revenue from the 2024 holiday season. Paid search and email also drove a significant share of revenue, according to Adobe without providing specific figures.

Generative artificial intelligence chat services, like ChatGPT, also increased its share of referring sales, according to Adobe data. Consumers especially used these tools to find deals and research products. Traffic to U.S. retail sites from generative AI increased 670% year over year. Adobe did not reveal the percent of traffic that comes from generative AI.

“While the base of users remains modest, the uptick shows the value AI can deliver as a shopping assistant,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a press release. “These services were used most in categories including video games, toys, appliances, electronics and personal care products.”

Discounts

Retailers’ strong discounts drove the considerable increase in online sales this holiday season, according to Adobe. In many categories, the average peak discount rate was higher than in 2024:

Electronics — 30.9% off listed price compared with 30.1% in 2024

Toys — 29.6% peak discount (vs. 28%)

Apparel — 25.1% peak discount (vs. 23.2%)

Televisions — 24.3% peak discount (vs. 24.2%)

Computers — 23.4% peak discount (vs. 22.8%)

Sporting goods — 20.3% peak discount (vs. 19.5%)

Appliances — 20.2% peak discount (vs. 19.2%)

Furniture — 18.8% peak discount (vs. 19%)

Deep discounts also enticed shoppers to purchase higher-ticket items and many shoppers “traded up,” according to Adobe.

Barclays cited the growing interest in cryptocurrencies as part of the reason for its strategic investment. The U.S. banking giant also highlighted progress in regulatory processes in several jurisdictions, adoption, and emerging use cases, adding that both companies will remain committed to the responsible development of tokenized money within the regulatory perimeter.

Stablecoins in particular are increasingly becoming a popular segment of the industry after President Trump signed into law the much-awaited GENIUS Act last July. The bill provides clarity for regulating cryptocurrencies tied to real-world assets.

Commenting on the announcement, Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays, said: “Interoperability is essential to unlock the full potential of digital assets. As the landscape of tokens, blockchains, and wallets evolves, specialist technology will play a pivotal role in delivering connectivity and infrastructure to enable regulated financial institutions to interact seamlessly.”

Tony McLaughlin, CEO of Ubyx, commented: “Our mission is to build a common globalised acceptance network for regulated digital money, including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins. Bank participation is vital to provide par value redemption through regulated channels. We are entering a world in which every regulated firm offers digital wallets in addition to traditional bank accounts.”

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10.01%.

For the last reported quarter, The Bank of New York Mellon came out with earnings of $1.91 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 per share, representing a surprise of 8.52%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.94 per share, delivering a surprise of 11.49%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For The Bank of New York Mellon, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

The Bank of New York Mellon has an Earnings ESP of +3.13% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 13, 2026.

When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The Vera Rubin platform is not a single chip. Instead, it is a full system made of six chips that work together as one AI computer. Nvidia stated that the platform is already in full production, with shipments planned for the second half of 2026.

For now, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that Nvidia’s prior estimate of $500 billion in data center chip revenue through year-end has increased. She said customer demand has come in higher than expected across both current and future products.

Meanwhile, NVDA shares closed Tuesday at $187.24, showing little change on the day despite the announcements.

Performance Gains and Revenue Outlook

At the center of the platform is the Rubin graphics chip, which includes 288 gigabytes of HBM4 memory. This allows data to move much faster than in Nvidia’s current Blackwell system. Nvidia said the new setup offers close to three times the memory speed per chip.

In addition, the full rack system uses 72 Rubin chips along with Vera CPUs and other Nvidia hardware. As a result, Nvidia says the system can deliver up to five times more performance for AI tasks that run after models are trained.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said demand for both training and everyday AI use continues to rise. As a result, Wall Street now expects Nvidia to generate about $321.2 billion in revenue in calendar 2026, which would be about 57% growth from the prior year.

China Demand and Global Expansion

Separately, Huang said demand from China for Nvidia’s H200 chips remains very strong. He confirmed that production is active after the U.S. government signaled support for exports under a revenue-sharing plan. He added that final approval would be clear once orders are placed.

At the same time, Nvidia plans to expand its workforce in Israel. The company aims to double its staff there to ten thousand workers and build a new campus in Kiryat Tivon. This move reflects Nvidia’s long-term investment plans as AI demand continues to grow.

Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

On the Street, Nvidia holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target is $263.39, implying a 40.67% upside from the current price.

Albertsons saw net sales and other revenue increase by just under 2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, to about $19.1 billion, driven primarily by strong growth in pharmacy sales, the supermarket operator announced Wednesday.

Identical sales were up by 2.4%, an amount that was depressed by between 10 and 20 basis points by the delay in the distribution of SNAP benefits caused by the federal government shutdown last autumn.

Shoppers showed growing signs of price sensitivity during the quarter, with even higher-income shoppers paying more attention to costs, CEO Susan Morris said during a Wednesday morning earnings call.

Dive Insight:

The shaky economic conditions that defined Albertsons’ latest quarter affected shopping behavior across the income spectrum, with customers who earn less buying fewer items per trip, prioritizing essentials and making more frequent visits to stores, Morris said. Middle-income households, which Morris said had been “relatively resilient,” traded down in some categories as their spending capacity took a hit, while spending patterns among more affluent customers remained stable even as these shoppers became more conscious of price and value, she said.

In response, Albertsons stepped up personalized promotions and loyalty program enhancements during Q3 while also turning to “surgical management of cost inflation,” Morris said. The retailer continued to invest in its private label portfolio and is on course to increase its own brands penetration from 25% to 30%, she said.

“We also very carefully manage the pass through inflation to deliver value for customers across the entire company, ensuring affordability while protecting margins,” Morris said. The grocer leaned into artificial intelligence systems as it sought to deliver relief to shoppers while also charting its future course, she added.

Albertsons is also looking to digital relationships with shoppers to drive sales, Morris said, noting that the “Ask AI” search tool the company introduced in 2025 drove a 10% increase in basket size among people who use the capability.

“By leveraging AI, we’re creating differentiated experiences that go beyond convenience. They increase basket size, drive repeat trips and deepen loyalty,” Morris said.

Albertsons’ online sales rose 21% during Q3, while digital penetration reached about 9.5%, she said. Albertsons believes that its e-commerce business could become profitable as soon as the end of this year, President and CFO Sharon McCollam said during the call, adding that the company does not include retail media sales when calculating its digital profitability.

McCollam said Albertsons expects to face significant headwinds during the coming months stemming from Medicare drug price reductions related to the federal Inflation Reduction Act, the first round of which went into effect at the start of 2026. The company forecasts that the changes will depress identical sales during Q4 by about two-thirds of a percentage point and shave as many as 18 basis points off that metric for the full fiscal year, she said.

Albertsons has narrowed its guidance for fiscal 2025 as a result of the challenges posed by the government’s moves to reduce drug prices for consumers.

Here’s My Take Jensen Huang’s CES keynote wasn’t just about showing off new hardware.
Huang’s CES keynote made it clear that Nvidia isn’t waiting for this future to arrive.","Greetings from “the most powerful tech event in the world!”

I’m writing to you from Las Vegas, where I’m attending CES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show. This is the massive annual trade show that showcases the next generation of technology.

And I’ve already seen some wild things. Including this guy here…

Who I’ll save for a future issue.

But today, I want to cover Jensen Huang’s keynote, just like I did last year.

I wasn’t able to watch it live because I was attending the Boston Scientific and Hyundai keynote, although I’ll have a chance to see Huang speak at the Sphere later this week.

Still, I watched every minute of his CES keynote as soon as I got back to my hotel room.

And I don’t think it’s something we can afford to gloss over.

Because what he delivered was more than just a product showcase. It was Jensen Huang telling us where artificial intelligence is headed next…

And which companies are positioning themselves to control it.

From Cloud AI to Physical AI

For most of the last two years, artificial intelligence has been based almost entirely in the cloud.

We’ve measured progress by model size, training runs and how many tokens a system can generate per second.

That phase created enormous value. It also made Nvidia one of the most important companies in the world.

But Jensen Huang made something clear at CES this week.

That phase is ending.

The next phase of AI is not about generating words or images. It is about systems that can perceive the physical world, reason about it and take action on it. And Nvidia intends to supply the computing platform that makes this possible.

That’s why Huang spent so much time talking about physical AI in his keynote.

And it’s not just talk. During the keynote, he introduced Nvidia’s next major computing platform, Vera Rubin, which will enter production later this year.

Vera Rubin is a full-system architecture that combines Nvidia’s custom CPU, next-generation GPUs, high-bandwidth memory, networking and data processing units into a single rack-scale machine.

In layman’s terms, it represents a shift from AI as software to AI as an operating system for physical machines.

According to Nvidia, a full Vera Rubin NVL72 system can deliver more than 3 exaFLOPS of inference performance. That’s more than double what the previous generation delivered.

More important than that raw number is what it enables. These systems are designed to run massive AI workloads continuously, with lower training costs and far higher throughput than before.

And that’s a huge deal because physical AI is compute-hungry in a way that cloud-only AI isn’t.

Training a language model is expensive. But training a system to drive a car, operate a robot or control industrial equipment is far more demanding.

These systems must process sensor data in real-time and simulate thousands of possible outcomes before acting. And they must do it reliably, not once, but every second of every day.

Nvidia is aligning its entire platform around making that possible.

Huang also unveiled Alpamayo, a new reasoning-focused AI stack designed for autonomous vehicles.

The key problem for driverless vehicles is that seeing the world isn’t enough. Autonomous systems tend to fail in unusual situations outside their training data.

Nvidia is trying to solve that by pairing perception with reasoning, so vehicles can think through a situation before acting.

Mercedes-Benz plans to ship vehicles using this system in early 2026.

Nvidia paired that announcement with demonstrations of its simulation software, which allows companies to generate vast amounts of synthetic training data. With it, robots, vehicles and industrial systems can be trained in virtual environments before they ever touch the real world.

Nvidia says these tools are already being used by robotics companies and manufacturers to accelerate development and reduce costs.

Taken together, Huang’s message from CES shows that — once again — he’s seemingly pivoting at exactly the right moment.

Nvidia is aiming to become the operating system for intelligent machines.

And the company can afford to make that bet because its current business is throwing off an extraordinary amount of cash.

In its most recent reported quarter, Nvidia generated roughly $57 billion in revenue, with data center sales dominating growth. Those numbers were driven by cloud providers racing to build AI infrastructure.

But cloud demand alone doesn’t justify the scale of investment Nvidia is making now.

Physical AI does.

Autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, logistics systems and intelligent factories represent a much larger and longer-lasting market than chatbots. These systems will require continuous upgrades, ongoing training and massive compute budgets.

And that changes the economics. It also helps explain Nvidia’s competitive position.

Because building a fast chip is difficult. Building an integrated platform that spans hardware, networking, software, simulation and developer tools is even harder.

But once companies commit to that full stack, switching becomes costly.

That’s the payoff Nvidia is banking on.

Here’s My Take

Jensen Huang’s CES keynote wasn’t just about showing off new hardware.

It was about drawing a line between the AI era we’re living through now and the one that comes next.

This current one is all about models and cloud computing. But we’re quickly moving into a new phase that’s all about machines acting in the real world.

Nvidia is building the control system for that future, and the scale of that opportunity is larger than anything the company has pursued before.

Huang’s CES keynote made it clear that Nvidia isn’t waiting for this future to arrive.

In September 2025, it launched the People-First AI Fund to support nonprofits “working at the intersection of innovation and public good.” Two months later, the foundation announced its first recipients.
If the People-First AI Fund can help recipients operate more efficiently, the initiative will emerge as a compelling case study of how a grantmaker can leverage AI to drive meaningful, short-term impact.
The fact that the foundation selected 208 People-First AI Fund recipients after reviewing close to 3,000 applications within two months suggests its officers were up to the task.
To this point, many People-First AI Fund grantees provide direct services in fields like veterans support, health, STEM education and food security.","In November of 2025, OpenAI restructured as a public benefit corporation — a for-profit company with a commitment to making a positive impact on society and the environment while generating financial return. The nonprofit that controlled OpenAI, rebranded as the OpenAI Foundation, received a 26% equity stake valued at $130 billion in OpenAI Group PBC.

The restructuring generated a litany of questions, not the least of which was what the OpenAI Foundation’s grantmaking would look like. Fortunately, the company had offered some clues in the run-up to the announcement.

In September 2025, it launched the People-First AI Fund to support nonprofits “working at the intersection of innovation and public good.” Two months later, the foundation announced its first recipients. It would disburse $40.5 million in unrestricted grants to 208 U.S.-based nonprofits by the end of the year, and a second wave of $9.5 million in board-directed grants would be announced in the following months.

At a time when some funders are grappling with ways to anticipate AI’s more profound impacts on society, People-First AI Fund grantees, some of which have never used AI or are in the early adoption phase, hope to leverage the technology to optimize service delivery in areas like mental health, education and food security.

Many organizations in the direct services field have struggled to generate sustainable philanthropic support in recent years, as small donor support declines, and some funders pivot to advocacy and organizing to address the root causes of problems. Federal funding cuts and lapsed foundation funding over the past 12 months have exacerbated this challenge. If the People-First AI Fund can help recipients operate more efficiently, the initiative will emerge as a compelling case study of how a grantmaker can leverage AI to drive meaningful, short-term impact.

“One thing the grantees have in common is that they’re community-driven,” said Daniel Zingale, who convened OpenAI’s nonprofit commission, which supported an engagement process to inform how OpenAI’s philanthropy can address long-term systemic issues. “And what we heard, wherever we went, was that AI should benefit all of humanity, and humanity needs a seat at the table.”

How the People-First AI Fund came together

The seeds of the fund were planted in April of last year, when OpenAI assembled a nonprofit commission tasked with informing OpenAI’s philanthropic efforts.

The company “communicated a genuine interest in getting community input,” said Zingale, who previously served as senior vice president of the The California Endowment and strategist to California Govs. Gavin Newsom and Arnold Schwarzenegger. “If you believe that AI carries with it extreme promise and extreme peril, then who are the people that you would want to tip that balance toward benefiting humanity?”

The commission’s advisors held listening sessions with over 100 organizations and over 500 individuals throughout California. “The commission called the shots in terms of whether we would do a listening tour and who we would invite,” he said. “I think we did a good job at getting cross-representation across the communities — faith-based groups, academia, community organizing, farm workers.”

The commission published its report in July. Its authors encouraged the company’s philanthropy to zero in on three priorities: invest in the people sector and close economic gaps, democratize the understanding and influence of AI, and unlock AI to transform and scale philanthropy.

In an October 28 post announcing the company’s restructuring, OpenAI Board of Directors Chair Bret Taylor said the OpenAI Foundation “will initially focus on a $25 billion commitment” across two areas: health and curing diseases, and supporting “practical technical solutions for AI resilience, which is about maximizing AI’s benefits and minimizing its risks.”

While Taylor’s post didn’t provide a timeline for disbursing those funds, I noted the potential challenge of scaling up the foundation’s grantmaking machinery. The fact that the foundation selected 208 People-First AI Fund recipients after reviewing close to 3,000 applications within two months suggests its officers were up to the task. The $40.5 million the foundation will disburse through the fund by the end of 2025 was a 440% increase over the previous year’s grantmaking outlay of $7.5 million.

“We tried to make the process user friendly and not burdensome or bureaucratic,” Zingale said. “Obviously, it needed to be thorough and done with integrity, but I think it demonstrated that it doesn’t have to put already strained community organizations through an arduous process.”

Contextualizing the People-First AI Fund within the larger funding ecosystem

Every funder wants to see AI developed in a way that benefits humanity. However — and at the risk of oversimplifying a large, interconnected and growing segment of the philanthrosphere — grantmakers’ AI-related work often falls into one of two buckets.

The first is more forward looking and conceptual in nature. Grantmakers seek to preserve the dignity of workers and the diminishment of human connection while staving off an AI-induced apocalypse. Funders tackling these issues include the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, Eric and Wendy Schmidt, Omidyar Network and the foundations behind the five-year, $500 million Humanity AI initiative.

The second bucket focuses on more tangible, short-term applications of AI to advance specific priority areas like global development (Gates Foundation), medical research (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), education (Salesforce), economic mobility (NextLadder Ventures and Robin Hood’s AI Poverty Challenge) and children’s mental health (Google).

Obviously, funders can simultaneously work on both priorities by, for example, planning for a world of mass automation in 2075 while providing workers with the skills to land a job today. Regardless of the issue or timeline in question, funders aim to ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed equitably so that the technology benefits the many and not the few.

Generally speaking, the work conducted by the community-focused grantees of OpenAI Foundation’s People-First AI Fund falls into this second category by addressing what it calls “immediate needs.”

These include AI literacy and public understanding so people “can engage with AI in ways that matter for their lives”; community innovations to improve access to essential services and strengthen civic life; and economic opportunity in the form of “meaningful, fairly distributed work as AI changes the labor landscape.” The second wave of People-First AI Fund grants will support organizations “already advancing transformative AI work across areas like health.”

Using AI to more effectively deliver direct services

People-First AI Fund recipients have annual budgets between $500,000 and $10 million. Their familiarity with AI ranges from “figuring it out, or they’re very anxious to figure it out,” Zingale said. “That was a discovery for us, to find out that a small organization in a rural corner of Montana is already incorporating AI.”

Zingale’s commentary suggests that organizational leaders realize that the AI genie is out of the bottle. Rather than push back against it, they can embrace it — or, at the very least, thoughtfully explore ways in which the technology can advance their missions.

To this point, many People-First AI Fund grantees provide direct services in fields like veterans support, health, STEM education and food security. It goes without saying that it’s been rough sledding for direct service providers over the past year. Many organizations lost federal funding, and those that didn’t receive federal support to begin with had to contend with increased demand due to the cuts inflicted on organizations in their geographic region. Looking ahead, analysts fear that proposed cuts in President Donald Trump’s 2026 fiscal budget will add additional strain on direct services providers.

“There’s a hearty representation of direct service organizations” in People-First AI Fund’s cohort, Zingale said. “We didn’t position [the fund] as a kind of emergency relief response, but again, when you listen to community at this moment in time, what you hear is that direct service providers are in desperate need of relief, and so that found its way into this cohort of grantees.”

Given the profound challenges facing direct services organizations, it will be interesting to see how grantees harness AI to deliver services and the extent to which the OpenAI Foundation shares its insights with the broader field.

“I think there’s a general understanding that there’s no going back,” Zingale said. “So how to you go forward in a way that meets people’s needs — maybe with less resources, but done more efficiently? And I think that there’s a great deal of hope that AI is part of the solution.”",https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2677731345-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 13:03:01.043893

Alaska has a long history with Boeing, which makes the Max miles from the airline’s Seattle headquarters.
Alaska has a fleet of 413 planes, which it expects to grow to 475 by 2030, and to more than 550 by 2035.
The airline is the fifth largest in the United States, though its 8 percent market share is still only about half that of United Airlines, which ranks fourth.
United, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines dominate the U.S. market.","Alaska Airlines said on Wednesday that it would buy 110 Boeing planes, part of an ambitious plan for growth fueled by its recent acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. The order is the largest in the airline’s history and will support Alaska’s expansion, including to destinations abroad.

“This fleet investment builds on the strong foundation Alaska has created to support steady, scalable and sustained growth,” Ben Minicucci, Alaska’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We are incredibly proud to be partnering with Boeing, a Pacific Northwest neighbor and a company that stands as a symbol of American innovation and manufacturing.”

For Boeing, the deal contributes momentum to its turnaround since a harrowing incident two years ago when a panel blew off one of its 737 Max planes operated by Alaska Airlines. No one was seriously injured, but that flight raised concerns about the quality of Boeing’s planes and prompted major changes at the company.

Alaska did not disclose the value of the deal with Boeing, but typically an order of this size would cost billions of dollars. The airline will receive five 787 Dreamliners, two-aisle planes that it plans to use for long-distance international flights; and 105 Max 10s, the model’s largest version. The Max 8 and Max 9, single-aisle planes used for short and medium-haul routes, have been flying for years, with the Max 10 widely expected to be certified by federal authorities later this year.

Alaska has a long history with Boeing, which makes the Max miles from the airline’s Seattle headquarters. The airline has historically operated an all-Boeing fleet, though it acquired a few dozen Airbus planes in its merger with Hawaiian Airlines, which will continue to fly under Hawaiian’s own brand.

Alaska has a fleet of 413 planes, which it expects to grow to 475 by 2030, and to more than 550 by 2035. The airline is the fifth largest in the United States, though its 8 percent market share is still only about half that of United Airlines, which ranks fourth. United, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines dominate the U.S. market.

Alaska is in the middle of a major expansion, both on the West Coast and abroad. Last year, the airline began flying from Seattle to Tokyo and Seoul. This summer, it plans to add flights to Rome, London and Reykjavik, Iceland. Alaska recently revamped its loyalty program and is adding more premium seats to its planes while also building new airport lounges, all in an effort to attract and retain high-spending travelers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/09/multimedia/07biz-boeing-alaska/09storm-pnw-hqfw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 14:04:10.402195
ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-07 16:39:18+00:00,ctech,Jensen Huang: “Nvidia's team in Israel is incredible. I'll be visiting soon.” | Ctech,Elihay Vidal,,,,,https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/sjnagzjeze,"LAS VEGAS - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered rare insight into the company’s operations in Israel at a press conference during CES 2026 on Tuesday, emphasizing the central role the country plays in the world’s most valuable technology company.
“Our team in Israel is incredible.
They're hardworking, they're smart, they're dedicated, they care about the company, they care about their people, they care about the country,” Huang said when asked about Nvidia’s presence in Israel.
“Nvidia’s BlueField-4 DPU and three networking components, the ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, NVLink 6 Switch, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch all came out of Israel.
We have people in our Israel office who have been with the company for 20-25 years.","LAS VEGAS - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered rare insight into the company’s operations in Israel at a press conference during CES 2026 on Tuesday, emphasizing the central role the country plays in the world’s most valuable technology company. Nvidia, with a market capitalization of approximately $4.55 trillion, has been operating in Israel since its $6.9 billion acquisition of networking firm Mellanox in 2019. The acquisition transformed Mellanox’s Yokneam headquarters into Nvidia’s primary Israeli hub, which now employs roughly 3,000 of the company’s 5,000 Israeli staff.

“Our team in Israel is incredible. They're hardworking, they're smart, they're dedicated, they care about the company, they care about their people, they care about the country,” Huang said when asked about Nvidia’s presence in Israel. “The sacrifices they make for each other, for their country, is incredible, and we’ve been very, very successful there.”

Huang highlighted Israel’s role in the development of key Nvidia chips. “Nvidia’s BlueField-4 DPU and three networking components, the ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, NVLink 6 Switch, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch all came out of Israel. So, four out of six chips came out of Israel. Pretty amazing. And maybe next time, six out of six chips.”

The CEO also emphasized the company’s culture and approach to talent management. “Our turnover is incredibly low. You know, it’s probably one or two percent in Israel. People stay for a very long time. We have people in our Israel office who have been with the company for 20-25 years. This is quite an extraordinary thing. Our ability to attract great people is second to none, and our ability to retain them is absolutely world class.”

Huang connected these achievements to Nvidia’s broader corporate philosophy: “We dedicate ourselves to choosing good work for the company to do, that’s one of the responsibilities of the CEO, to choose what kind of work we should be doing and what kind of work we shouldn’t be doing. The quality of the work, the purpose of the company, all of it comes together, and it’s pretty magical in Israel.”

The praise comes amid Nvidia’s ongoing expansion in the country. Last month, the company formally confirmed plans to establish a 160,000-square-meter campus in Kiryat Tivon, expected to employ roughly 10,000 workers. The facility will be built on 90 dunams of state-owned land granted with an exemption from public tender, representing one of the largest private technology investments in Israel in recent years.

Nvidia’s Israeli operations now represent a central node for the company’s global hardware development. Huang’s remarks underline not only the technological importance of Israel’s workforce but also the strategic commitment Nvidia has made to the country, a hub for advanced networking, AI, and high-performance computing technologies.",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2026/01/06/HkxXFbZjEWg/HkxXFbZjEWg_0_108_3000_1689_0_large.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 13:14:24.839376

Since launching its in-store digital display network, Albertsons Media Collective has delivered strong results and attracted more than 50 unique advertising partners eager to tap into the power of retail media, while staying focused on rapid growth and expansion.

Unlike traditional attribution models that assign credit to purchases that may have occurred anyway, Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market framework measures the true incremental impact of in-store media, isolating the effect of advertising as the sole driver of lift. The incrementality solution operates at the store level, comparing sales performance in test stores exposed to ads against a rigorously selected set of control stores with no media exposure. By estimating the counterfactual, what would have happened without advertising, the model delivers a statistically validated measure of true lift.

Albertsons Media Collective, NBCUniversal debut CTV closed-loop measurement

Albertsons Media Collective’s in-store incrementality measurement addresses one of the industry’s most persistent challenges: accurately measuring in-store media, which operates outside the signal-rich, identity-connected environment of other digital channels. Designed specifically to alleviate this complexity, the matched market framework delivers true incrementality by attributing sales, orders and unit lift solely to media exposure rather than correlation. The solution leverages nearly 60 variables for advanced store-level matching to reduce bias and noise, scales nationally across diverse store formats and works across both existing and new in-store screens, including deli and pharmacy placements.

“For too long, in-store media has been measured with tools that confuse correlation for impact,” said Liz Roche, vice president of media and measurement at Albertsons Media Collective. “Our matched market incrementality approach cuts through that noise. By isolating causal lift at the store level, we’re showing brands the actual impact of in-store media activation—and giving them confidence that their investment is driving net-new sales. We look forward to advancing the measurement capabilities we offer in the future with closed-loop measurement, while remaining compliant with and closely aligning our measurement roadmap with IAB current and future standards for in-store media.”

Albertsons Media Collective cited a recent campaign for Mondelēz International that it said highlights the effectiveness of in-store media when measured through Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market incrementality framework.

Designed to promote Sargento Cheese Bakes, a snack cracker from Mondelēz, the campaign aimed to drive household penetration, category growth and incremental sales. Mondelēz integrated in-store digital screens with high-engagement onsite and offsite media to build awareness and drive conversion among Albertsons shoppers. The addition of in-store screens contributed to a significant sales lift, demonstrating the incremental value of in-store activation within an omnichannel strategy.

“In-store is one of the most influential moments in the path to purchase, but historically it’s been difficult to measure with precision,” said Melissa Pitmon, customer director, OmniChannel, Mondelēz. “Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market measurement gave us clear, causal insight into how in-store media drove incremental sales, helping us optimize with confidence and validate the true impact of our investment.”

Albertsons Media Collective is a full-funnel media platform that reaches known shoppers across channels, now complete with in-store media which unlocks the full power of the omnichannel experience at the moments closest to the point of purchase. After bringing incrementality onsite and offsite, bringing incremental results to in-store media helps advertising partners truly understand collective growth.

Given the strong in-store results achieved since the launch of the in-store digital display network, Albertsons Media Collective is focused on expansion. In 2026, the in-store fleet will include about 800 additional stores, offering scaled coverage and strategic continuity, with presence across 10 divisions.",https://drugstorenews.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/2026-01/albertsons_instore_news_image_2.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:10.606823
ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-07 15:42:28+00:00,Quartz,Nvidia is putting its AI muscle behind autonomous vehicles - Quartz,"Shannon Carroll, qz.com",,,,,https://qz.com/nvidia-mercedes-benz-cla-parternship-drive-av,"So why wouldn’t it want to take the wheel in the global autonomous vehicle push, too?
CEO Jensen Huang tells Xu that his job is “to make everything that moves autonomous.” This is a crucial start.
“Everything that moves will ultimately be fully autonomous,” he said, also framing the era shift toward “physical AI,” with autonomous vehicles as one of the three categories of “robots” that matter.
Autonomy has spent years as a promise; Nvidia wants it to behave like infrastructure.
L2++ gets Nvidia into real cars without demanding a leap of faith, and Alpamayo pushes the hardest problems upstream into models and simulation — where Nvidia’s advantage is already industrial.","Nvidia is everywhere. Its logo has become the watermark of modern computing. It sits under AI-era compute, cloud infrastructure, PC graphics, and the industrial automation that’s quietly remaking factories. So why wouldn’t it want to take the wheel in the global autonomous vehicle push, too?

But Nvidia isn’t really chasing “self-driving cars.” Nvidia is doing something closer to chasing autonomy as an industrial stack — a set of chips, models, simulation tools, and safety systems that other companies can plug into, iterate on, and ship, without betting their entire company on a robotaxi moonshot. That framing sounds semantic until you sit inside one of Nvidia’s demo vehicles and listen to the company’s automotive leadership talk like they’re building a supply chain, not a sci-fi future.

Now, Nvidia’s first big “in cars” proof point has a pilot: The company’s Drive AV software is launching in the all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan, with an enhanced Level 2 (Nvidia calls it L2++) point-to-point driver-assistance system that Nvidia expects will hit U.S. roads this year. Mercedes is selling the tech, which it calls MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO for $3,950 for three years in the U.S., with monthly and yearly pricing still to come; Tesla, meanwhile, sells its Full Self-Driving for $8,000 a year or $99 a month. That’s great business for Mercedes, but it says something bigger about the changing AV landscape. What Nvidia is launching is the kind of autonomy that could actually ship at scale: driver assistance that still assumes a human behind the wheel — but with tech that Nvidia says can improve over time through software; the MB.OS design is built to enable over-the-air updates for future upgrades and features.

At a recent San Francisco ride-along tied to the Mercedes-Benz demo, Nvidia executives framed the company’s automotive push as a full-stack effort: the in-car computer, the models, the validation loop, and the industrial-scale training infrastructure behind it.

Xinzhou Wu, who leads Nvidia’s automotive group, said at the demo that the partnership has been over four years in the running, a full-stack and multiyear proof point for that mass-market approach. Under the hood — literally — Wu described what Nvidia is running in the demo vehicles: a “hybrid stack” that pairs an end-to-end model with a more traditional, “classical” stack that’s already deployed in Mercedes vehicles in Europe. The coupling is the point: The end-to-end model drives a more humanlike feel; the classical stack provides an interpretable backstop, with a “safety monitor” choosing the safer trajectory.

Physical AI, Wu said, is “a deep problem to solve for the next decade."" That frame positions Nvidia as the one vendor already built to supply all three layers — vehicle compute, data-center compute, simulation — and it reframes the autonomy arms race as a compute and tooling problem more than a map-and-sensors problem. In that worldview, the winners are the companies that can compress the loop: train faster, simulate more edge cases, deploy more safely, and keep the system improving without breaking the trust contract with drivers.

CEO Jensen Huang tells Xu that his job is “to make everything that moves autonomous.” This is a crucial start.

Underneath the architecture

Nvidia’s AV push is built to scale through partnerships like the one with Mercedes — the company supplying the compute-heavy backbone and tooling, and the automaker owning the vehicle, the brand, and the customer relationship. During the CLA test drive, Ali Kani, Nvidia’s VP of automotive, described the system in the most Nvidia way possible: as something engineered end-to-end, trained on Nvidia infrastructure, tested in the cloud, and gated by the process.

In a separate briefing, Kani zoomed out to full Nvidia-prophetic. “Everything that moves will ultimately be fully autonomous,” he said, also framing the era shift toward “physical AI,” with autonomous vehicles as one of the three categories of “robots” that matter. The rhetoric is big — maybe too big in an era where people still don’t entirely trust this technology — but it fits the underlying strategy: autonomy becomes another domain where Nvidia can supply... everything.

The near-term version, though, stays grounded in passenger-car reality: driver assistance, careful safety layering, and a partnership model designed to scale. The company isn’t trying to wrestle control of the wheel, rather building the system that makes more of the drive feel automatic — and then building the compute loop that enables that capability to improve. The global AV push has plenty of contenders chasing the spotlight. Nvidia’s move is quieter, more infrastructural, and therefore perhaps more dangerous in the way that platform plays tend to be.

Alpamayo, the long-tail bet

If the Mercedes CLA launch is Nvidia’s “in cars” proof point, Alpamayo is the part where Nvidia tries to turn autonomy into an ecosystem — and keep its hands on the tooling that determines who’s getting behind the wheel next.

Alpamayo is billed as a family of open-source models, simulation tools, and datasets aimed at “safe, reasoning-based” autonomous driving — specifically the ugly, rare “long tail” cases that still break systems in ways that never show up in a glossy demo loop. Nvidia’s attempt to make “reasoning” a product layer in autonomy and to standardize the upstream toolchain that improves systems over time. The pitch is that traditional autonomy architectures split perception and planning in ways that can limit scalability when something weird happens; end-to-end learning has moved the ball, but edge cases still demand models that can reason about cause and effect when the situation falls outside training experience.

Alpamayo introduces “chain-of-thought, reasoning-based” vision-language-action (VLA) models designed to think through novel scenarios step by step, with improved explainability that is “critical to scaling trust and safety,” according to the company, and the whole effort is “underpinned by the NVIDIA Halos safety system.” CEO Jensen Huang is leaning all the way into the moment-language, calling it “the ChatGPT moment for physical AI,” and arguing that Alpamayo can help vehicles “think through rare scenarios” and “explain their driving decisions,” as “the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”

Nvidia says Alpamayo models are teacher models, “rather than running directly in-vehicle,” meant to be fine-tuned and distilled into the runtime backbones of complete AV stacks. That makes Alpamayo feel less like “new feature coming to your Mercedes” and more like Nvidia trying to standardize the way autonomy gets built — the same platform instinct, aimed at the training/simulation layer where Nvidia already knows how to win.

Autonomy has spent years as a promise; Nvidia wants it to behave like infrastructure. L2++ gets Nvidia into real cars without demanding a leap of faith, and Alpamayo pushes the hardest problems upstream into models and simulation — where Nvidia’s advantage is already industrial. If this play works, the most important autonomy company won’t be the one with the biggest fleet. It’ll be the one that makes everyone else’s autonomy ship.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/Mercedes-Benz%20CLA%20L2%20Image.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 13:02:56.526729

The chips promise to eliminate water chiller requirements in data centers, potentially disrupting an established supply chain built around traditional cooling infrastructure.

Key Takeaways:

Johnson Controls and Trane Technologies dropped 7.5% and 5.3% respectively, hitting multi-month lows after Huang’s CES remarks

Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform, featuring six integrated chips now in full production, claims to eliminate water chiller needs in data center operations

Data centers contribute 10% of Trane Technologies’ revenue and low-double-digit percentages for Johnson Controls, putting substantial business at risk

Huang delivered his comments Monday evening at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where he revealed the Vera Rubin platform has entered full production ahead of its expected 2025 debut. His declaration that “no water chillers are necessary for data centres” sent immediate shockwaves through markets Tuesday morning.

Johnson Controls International plummeted to $112.40, while Trane Technologies sank to $370.40. Both companies ranked among the S&P 500’s worst performers for the session, reflecting investor concerns about their exposure to data center cooling contracts.

Barclays analysts, in research led by Julian Mitchell, acknowledged the gravity of Huang’s statements despite their initially dramatic tone. “Given the primacy of Nvidia to the whole AI ecosystem, one should not take their comments lightly,” they wrote, identifying the most vulnerable players in the cooling sector.

The investment bank’s analysis reveals varied exposure levels across manufacturers. Johnson Controls faces low-double-digit percentage dependence on data center sales, while Trane Technologies derives approximately 10% of revenue from this segment. Carrier Global, which saw shares decline 1.1%, has roughly 5% exposure.

Not every company in the infrastructure space faces headwinds from Nvidia’s announcement. Barclays pointed to potential beneficiaries, including nVent Electric, which avoids space cooling and chiller products but maintains solid positioning in data center liquid cooling systems. The firm’s shares edged 0.5% higher.

Vertiv Holdings, despite a 2.1% share decline, may also capitalize on the transition. The company brings established expertise in precision air cooling alongside competitive liquid cooling capabilities, positioning it to adapt as infrastructure requirements evolve.

The Vera Rubin platform combines six distinct Nvidia chips into an integrated system designed for AI workloads. The architecture apparently generates less heat than current solutions, enabling data centers to operate without traditional water-based cooling infrastructure that has dominated the industry for decades.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DH1L4415-HDR-20220527-r5-resize.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:01:07.474492

SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS OF THE NOTES

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, the following provisions will apply for purposes of the Notes.

Market Disruption Events

If the Calculation Agent determines that, on the Initial Valuation Date or any Observation Date (each, a “Valuation Date”), a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the Underlier, that Valuation Date will be postponed to the immediately succeeding Index Business Day (as defined under “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement) on which no Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing. In no event, however, will a Valuation Date be postponed by more than five scheduled Index Business Days. If the Calculation Agent determines that a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the Underlier on that fifth day, the Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Value of the Underlier for that fifth day in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.

If any Observation Date is postponed, the relevant Contingent Coupon Payment Date will be postponed such that the number of business days from the Observation Date to the Contingent Coupon Payment Date remains the same.

With respect to the Notes, a “Market Disruption Event” means:

●the occurrence of a Trading Disruption Event, an Index Market Disruption Event or an Index Disruption Event (each as defined and described under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement); or

●the failure of the Index Sponsor to calculate and publish the official closing level of the Underlier on an Index Business Day

in each case as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion.

Discontinuation of the Underlier; Alteration of Methodology or Calculation of the Underlier

If the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Underlier and the Index Sponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the discontinued Index (such index being referred to herein as a “Successor Index”), then the Closing Value of the Underlier on any relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined will be determined by reference to the level of that Successor Index at the time of daily final publication, or close of trading on the relevant exchange or market for that Successor Index, as applicable, on that date. If a Successor Index is selected by the Calculation Agent, the Successor Index will be used as a substitute for the Underlier for all purposes under the Notes, and the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion adjust any variable described in this pricing supplement, including but not limited to any level (including but not limited to the Initial Underlier Value, the Coupon Barrier Value, the Barrier Value, the Final Underlier Value and the Closing Value on any relevant date), or any combination thereof. The Calculation Agent will make any such adjustment with a view to offsetting, to the extent practicable, any difference in the relative levels of the Index and the Successor Index at the time the Index is replaced by the Successor Index.

If an Index Cancellation occurs on or prior to any Observation Date or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined and is continuing on that date, then the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion determine to compute the Closing Value of the Underlier in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating the Underlier or Successor Index, as applicable, last in effect prior to that Index Cancellation.

An “Index Cancellation” will occur if (a) the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Closing Value of the Underlier on or prior to any Observation Date (or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined) and that discontinuation is continuing on that day and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Index is available at that time or (b) the Calculation Agent has previously selected a Successor Index and publication of that Successor Index is discontinued prior to, and that discontinuation is continuing on, any Observation Date (or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined).

If at any time the method of calculating the Underlier or a Successor Index, or the level thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the Underlier or a Successor Index is in any other way modified such that the Underlier or that Successor Index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the level of the Underlier or that Successor Index had those changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion determine to make such calculations and adjustments as the Calculation Agent determines may be necessary in order to arrive at a level for the Underlier or Successor Index comparable to the Underlier or Successor Index, as the case may be, as if those changes or modifications had not been made, and determine whether the Notes are automatically redeemed and calculate the payment at maturity or any other payment to be made on the Notes with reference to the Underlier (or Successor Index), as adjusted.

Material Index Amendment Events

If a Material Index Amendment Event occurs prior to the Final Valuation Date, the Calculation Agent may elect in its sole discretion to cause the Maturity Date to be accelerated to a date no later than the tenth business day following the occurrence of that Material Index Amendment Event. In the event of such an acceleration, the amount payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date as so

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

●You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Underlier falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of the Underlier rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes in the event that the Final Underlier Value falls below the Barrier Value.

●You anticipate that the Closing Value of the Underlier will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of the Underlier will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Underlier Value will fall below the Barrier Value.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept that the performance of the Underlier will be affected by a decrement of 6% per annum.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept that the investment strategy used to construct the Index may not be successful and may underperform any alternative strategy that might be constructed from the Futures Index.

●You seek an investment that entitles you to rights with respect to the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to, the securities composing the Reference Index.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be automatically redeemed.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENTS DURING THE TERM OF THE NOTES

The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are not automatically redeemed.

* The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value or Coupon Barrier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value will be equal to 70.00% of the Initial Underlier Value.

For information regarding recent values of the Underlier, please see “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” in this pricing supplement.

Example 1: The Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the first and second Observation Dates, but the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each other Observation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first and second Observation Dates, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $11.958 per $1,000 principal amount Note (1.1958% of the principal amount) on each related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the remaining Observation Dates, the Contingent Coupons applicable to those Observation Dates will not be payable at any time.

Example 2: The Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates, but the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than the Coupon Barrier Value on the first and final Observation Dates.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the first Observation Date, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $11.958 per $1,000 principal amount Note (1.1958% of the principal amount) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates, the Contingent Coupons applicable to those Observation Dates will not be payable on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Dates; however, because the Closing Value of the Underlier on the final Observation Date is greater than the Coupon Barrier Value, the Contingent Coupons that would have been paid on the second through fifty-ninth Contingent Coupon Payment Dates had the Closing Value of the Underlier been greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates will be paid on the final Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■Hypothetical Barrier Value: 50.00 (50.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT automatically redeemed.

* The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of 50.00 have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value will be equal to 70.00% and 50.00%, respectively, of the Initial Underlier Value.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The value of the Underlier increases from an Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of 150.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

Example 1 demonstrates that you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Underlier. Even though the Underlier appreciated significantly, the payment at maturity is limited to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

Example 2: The value of the Underlier decreases from an Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of 80.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

INFORMATION REGARDING THE UNDERLIER

The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index (the “Index”) is a rules-based proprietary index created and owned by Barclays Bank PLC. The Index is operated by Barclays Index Administration, a distinct function within Barclays Bank PLC (in such capacity, the “Index Sponsor”). The Index Sponsor has appointed a third party, MerQube, Inc. (together with any successor thereto, the “Index Calculation Agent”), to calculate and maintain the Index. The Index is reported by Bloomberg under the ticker symbol “BXIIUT4E.”

The Index attempts to provide variable exposure of up to 400% to the Barclays US Tech Tracker ER Index (the “Futures Index”), with greater exposure when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower (subject to the maximum exposure of 400%) and lesser exposure when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher (subject to a minimum exposure of 100%). The Futures Index tracks the excess return of a notional rolling position in the first nearby futures contract on the Nasdaq-100 Index® (the “Reference Index”). For more information about the Futures Index, see “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Background on the Barclays US Tech Tracker ER Index” in the accompanying underlying supplement. The Reference Index is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. For more information about the Reference Index, see “Indices—The Nasdaq-100 Index®” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

The Index is subject to a 6% per annum decrement, deducted daily. The decrement will offset appreciation of the Futures Index, heighten depreciation of the Futures Index and generally act as a drag on the performance of the Index. The Index will trail the performance of an identical index without a decrement.

The Index applies an exposure (the “Index Exposure”) of between 100% and 400% to the Futures Index, with the aim of increasing exposure (subject to the maximum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower and decreasing exposure (subject to the minimum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher. The Index Exposure is not adjusted according to a predetermined schedule. Instead, on each Index Business Day (as defined below), the Index determines a new target exposure to the Futures Index, but the Index Exposure will be adjusted only if the new target exposure differs sufficiently from the current Index Exposure. Otherwise, the Index will maintain its current Index Exposure.

On each Index Business Day, the target exposure of the Index to the performance of the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is set equal to (a) a volatility level of 40% (the “volatility threshold”) divided by (b) the realized volatility of the Futures Index, subject to a maximum exposure of 400% and a minimum exposure of 100%. The Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index will equal the maximum exposure of 400% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is less than or equal to 10% and will equal the minimum exposure of 100% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is greater than or equal to 40%. The Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index will be between 400% and 100% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is between 10% and 40%. For example, if the realized volatility of the Futures Index is equal to 20%, the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will equal 200% (or 40% / 20%). No assurance can be provided that the realized volatility of the Index will approximate the volatility threshold. The realized volatility of the Index may be greater or less than the volatility threshold, perhaps significantly.

The Index Exposure remains unchanged on each Index Business Day, unless a newly calculated target exposure based on the realized volatility of the Futures Index on a subsequent Index Business Day would be, on an absolute basis, 40% or more above or below the current Index Exposure. For example, if the Index Exposure is 200%, the Index Exposure will remain unchanged unless the target exposure is greater than 240% or less than 160%. If an Index Exposure adjustment is triggered, the Index will adjust the Index Exposure on the immediately following Index Business Day (a “Rebalancing Day”), subject to the occurrence of a Trading Disruption Event (as defined and described under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index” in the accompanying underlying supplement).

The Index Calculation Agent began calculating the Index on a live basis on April 22, 2025.

“Index Business Day” means any day on which the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (or any successor thereto) is scheduled to be open for business for equity futures contracts.

The Index is an “excess return” index, and not a “total return” index, because the Futures Index provides notional exposure to futures contract returns that reflect changes in the price of those futures contracts and does not reflect interest that could be earned on funds notionally committed to the trading of futures contracts, resulting in an implicit financing cost.

Certain features of the Index, including the decrement described above, are designed to make it possible for certain economic terms of the Notes to be more favorable to you than would otherwise be the case, all else being equal. However, there can be no assurance that these more favorable terms will offset the negative effects of these features on the performance of the Index, and your return on the Notes may ultimately be less favorable than it would have been without these more favorable terms but with an index that does not contain these features.

The Index is subject to risks associated with the use of significant leverage. When leverage is employed, any movements in the values of the Futures Index will result in greater changes in the value of the Index than if leverage were not used. In particular, the use of leverage will magnify any negative performance of the Futures Index, which, in turn, would negatively affect the performance of the Index. The use of leverage will cause the volatility of the Index to be greater, perhaps

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underlier, the Futures Index, the Reference Index or their components. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not automatically redeemed, and if the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes—The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date a Contingent Coupon plus all previously Unpaid Contingent Coupons, if any, only if the Closing Value of the Underlier on an Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Underlier on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date will not be payable on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If a Contingent Coupon is not paid on any Contingent Coupon Payment Date, that Contingent Coupon will be paid as an Unpaid Contingent Coupon on a later Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Underlier on a subsequent Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of the Underlier—The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Underlier, which may be significant, even though you will be fully exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value if the Notes are not automatically redeemed and the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Will Be Different Depending on the Sequence of Closing Value of the Underlier on Different Observation Dates—Depending on the sequence in which the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on specific Observation Dates (if at all), you could receive a lesser or greater return regardless of the number of Observation Dates on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. For example, if the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first fifty-nine Observation Dates but is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the final Observation Date, you will receive sixty Contingent Coupons (fifty-nine in the form of Unpaid Contingent Coupons). However, if the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first two Observation Dates but on no subsequent Observation Dates, you will receive only two Contingent Coupons, even though the Closing Value of the Underlier was greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on twice as many Observation Dates as in the previous example.

●Automatic Redemption and Reinvestment Risk—If the Notes are automatically redeemed, the holding period over which you may receive Contingent Coupons could be as short as approximately one year. The payment upon an automatic redemption, together with any Contingent Coupons that you may have received on prior Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been automatically redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are automatically redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after an automatic redemption. The automatic redemption feature of the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the Underlier determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of the Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Automatic Redemption—You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any automatic redemption. If you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Underlier has increased from the Initial Underlier Value. See “—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk—Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The Contingent Coupon is determined based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Underlier. The Contingent Coupon will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would be if the level of expected volatility of the Underlier taken into account in determining the terms of the Notes were lower. As volatility of the Underlier increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Underlier on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Underlier Value will be less than the Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher Contingent Coupon reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive Contingent Coupons with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the Contingent Coupon been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive Contingent Coupons and/or that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index or the Securities Composing the Reference Index—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or the securities composing the Reference Index. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have any rights with respect to the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the securities composing the Reference Index would have.

●Tax Treatment—Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier Generally

●The Index May Not Be Successful or Outperform Any Alternative Investment Strategy That Might Be Employed with Respect to the Futures Index—There can be no assurance that the investment strategy on which the Index is based will be successful or that the Index will outperform any alternative strategy that might be employed with respect to the Futures Index.

●The Value of the Index Will Reflect a 6% per Annum Decrement, Deducted Daily—The performance of the Index will be reduced by the decrement of 6% per annum, deducted daily. As a result of the decrement, the Index performance will trail that of a hypothetical, identically constituted index from which no such decrement is deducted.

The decrement will place a significant drag on the performance of the Index, potentially offsetting positive returns on the Index’s investment strategy, exacerbating negative returns of its investment strategy and causing the value of the Index to decline steadily if the return of its investment strategy is relatively flat. The Index will not appreciate unless the return of its investment strategy is sufficient to offset the negative effect of the decrement, and then only to the extent that the return of its investment strategy is greater than the decrement. As a result of the decrement, the value of the Index may decline even if the return of its investment strategy is positive.

●The Index Is Subject to Risks Associated with the Use of Significant Leverage—The Index applies an exposure of between 100% and 400% to the Futures Index, with the aim of increasing exposure (subject to the maximum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower and decreasing exposure (subject to the minimum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher. Under normal market conditions in the past, the Futures Index has tended to exhibit a realized volatility below 40%. Accordingly, based on hypothetical back-tested and historical performance, the Index has

generally employed leverage in the past, except during periods of elevated volatility. When leverage is employed, any movements in the value of the Futures Index will result in greater changes in the value of the Index than if leverage were not used. In particular, the use of leverage will magnify any negative performance of the Futures Index, as well as the negative effect of the implicit financing cost embedded in the Futures Index, which, in turn, would negatively affect the performance of the Index. The use of leverage will cause the volatility of the Index to be greater, perhaps significantly greater, than the volatility of the Futures Index, and no assurance can be given that the annualized realized volatility of the Index will approximate the volatility threshold of 40%. The exposure of the Index to the Futures Index may be relatively high during periods of negative performance of the Futures Index and/or relatively low during periods of positive performance of the Futures Index, which would adversely affect the performance of the Index, perhaps significantly. In situations where a significant increase in volatility of the Futures Index is accompanied by a significant decline in the value of the Futures Index, the value of the Index may decline significantly before the next Rebalancing Day when the Index’s exposure to the Futures Index would be reduced. If, on any Index Business Day, the value of the Index as calculated is negative or zero, the value of the Index on that Index Business Day will be zero, and the value of the Index will stay at zero. In this scenario, you will not receive any further Contingent Coupons and you will lose the entire principal amount of your Notes at maturity.

●The Index Is Subject to Risks Associated with Its Methodology for Setting the Index Exposure—No assurance can be given that the Index’s methodology for setting the Index Exposure will be successful or outperform any alternative strategy that might be employed with respect to setting the Index Exposure.

On each Index Business Day, the target exposure of the Index to the performance of the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is set equal to (a) the volatility threshold of 40% divided by (b) the realized volatility of the Futures Index, subject to a maximum exposure of 400% and a minimum exposure of 100%. On any Index Business Day, the realized volatility of the Futures Index used to determine the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is equal to the lower of the short-term realized volatility of the Futures Index and the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index. The short-term realized volatility and long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index on an Index Business Day are calculated based on the daily returns of the Futures Index from the base date of the Index to that Index Business Day, with half-lives of 5 and 21 Index Business Days, respectively.

There is no guarantee that the methodology used by the Index to determine the realized volatility of the Futures Index will be representative of the realized volatility that the Futures Index will experience. Realized volatility is backward looking, and there is no guarantee that trends exhibited by historical realized volatility will continue in the future. In addition, the volatility of the Futures Index on any day may change quickly and unexpectedly, but it may take time for the realized volatility referenced by the Index to fully reflect those changes and for the target exposure of the Index to be adjusted accordingly. In particular, since the Index references the lower of the short-term and the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index, if the short-term realized volatility of the Futures Index increases suddenly, the Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index may not be reduced unless and until the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index also increases. In addition, the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will not be further reduced when the realized volatility of the Futures Index exceeds 40% due to the minimum exposure, and the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will not be further increased when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is below 10% due to the maximum exposure. Furthermore, the Index Exposure will be adjusted only if the newly calculated target exposure is, on an absolute basis, 40% or more above or below the current Index Exposure.

●The Index May Be Adversely Affected by a “Volatility Drag” Effect—The Index may be subject to a “volatility drag” effect due to the resetting leveraged exposure to the Futures Index. The drag effect is likely to occur when the value of the Futures Index moves in one direction prior to an Index Exposure adjustment and the other direction following that Index Exposure adjustment. Resetting the exposure of the Index after an increase but in advance of a decline in the Futures Index would cause the Index to have increased exposure to that decline, and resetting the exposure following a decline but in advance of an increase in the Futures Index would cause the Index to have decreased exposure to that increase. The more this fact pattern repeats, the lower the performance of the Index will be relative to the performance of the Futures Index. The Index may rebalance as frequently as daily, and the Index may be subject to a greater drag effect compared with an identical index that rebalances less frequently.

●The Index Sponsor Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Closing Value of the Index and the Amount Payable on the Notes and Their Market Value and Create Conflicts of Interest—The Index Sponsor, a distinct function within Barclays Bank PLC, is responsible for the operation of the Index, and the policies of the Index Sponsor concerning the calculation of the Closing Value of the Index could affect the Closing Value of the Index and, therefore, the amount payable on the Notes at maturity and the market value of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity.

The Index Sponsor may modify the methodology for calculating the Closing Value of the Index. In addition, as described in “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement, the Index Sponsor may make certain changes to the way in which the Index is calculated. For example, the Index Sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the Index upon the occurrence of certain market disruptions or other events, in which case it may become difficult to determine the Closing Value of the Index and the value of the Notes. In addition, the Index Sponsor may replace the Futures Index as the underlying index if a material change is made to the calculation methodology of the Futures Index or the Reference Index. The replacement underlying index may perform significantly worse than the Futures Index. Any such changes could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The circumstances in which the Index Sponsor might make any such a determination are described more fully under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The

Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, if a modification to the Index or the Futures Index constitutes a Material Index Amendment Event, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly. See “Supplemental Terms of the Notes—Material Index Amendment Events” above.

The role played by the Index Sponsor, and the exercise of the kinds of discretion described above and in the section entitled “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement, could present it with significant conflicts of interest in light of the fact that Barclays Bank PLC is the issuer of the Notes. The Index Sponsor has no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into consideration at any time.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or the Underlier or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●The Index Has a Limited Performance History—The Index Calculation Agent began calculating the Index on a live basis on April 22, 2025, and the Index Sponsor has published limited information about how the Index might have performed had it been calculated in the past. Because the Index is new and limited historical performance data exists, your investment in the Notes may involve a greater risk than investing in alternate securities linked to one or more indices with an established record of performance. A longer history of actual performance would be helpful in providing more reliable information on which to assess the validity of the methodology that the Index uses as the basis for an investment decision.

●Hypothetical Back-Tested Data Relating to the Index Does Not Represent Actual Historical Data and Is Subject to Inherent Limitations—All data relating to the period prior to the launch date of the Index, including the table and graphs set forth under “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” below, is purely theoretical and does not represent the actual historical performance of the Index and has not been verified by an independent third party. The information is based on a hypothetical estimate by the Index Sponsor using available historical data as to how the Index may have performed in the pre-launch date period. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions may produce different hypothetical historical information that might prove to be more appropriate and that might differ significantly from the hypothetical historical information set forth under “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” below. In addition, back-tested, hypothetical historical results have inherent limitations. These back-tested results are achieved by means of a retroactive application of a back-tested model designed with the benefit of hindsight. Hypothetical back-tested data should not be taken as an indication of future performance.

●Historical or Hypothetical Historical Levels of the Index Should Not Be Taken as an Indication of the Future Performance of the Index During the Term of the Notes—The actual performance of the Index over the term of the Notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, may bear little relation to the historical or hypothetical historical levels of the Index. Past fluctuations and trends in the Index are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations or trends that may occur in the future.

●The Index Is Not Actively Managed—The Index operates by pre-determined rules, as described under “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement. There will be no active management of the Index to enhance returns or limit losses. An actively managed investment may potentially respond more directly and appropriately to immediate market, political, economic, financial or other factors than the non-actively managed Index, which may adversely affect the Closing Value of the Index and the value of the Notes.

●The Index Is Comprised of Synthetic Assets and Liabilities—The exposure to the Futures Index at any given time is purely synthetic and will exist solely in the records maintained by or on behalf of the Index Sponsor. There is no actual portfolio of assets to which any person or entity is entitled or in which any person or entity has any ownership interest. Consequently, no person or entity will have any claim against any of the components of the Futures Index or the Reference Index at any time.

Risks Relating to the Futures Index

●The Futures Index Reflects the Price Return of the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index, Not the Total Return—The performance of the Index, and therefore the return on the Notes, is based on the performance of the Futures Index, which reflects changes in the market prices of the futures contracts composing the Futures Index and positive or negative yields associated with rolling those futures contracts. The Futures Index (and, in turn, the Index) is not a “total return” index that, in addition to reflecting those price and roll returns, would also reflect interest on a hypothetical cash position collateralizing the futures contracts composing the Futures Index. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

●Adjustments to the Futures Index Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes—The sponsor of the Futures Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or make other methodological changes to the

Futures Index that could affect its performance, and the sponsor of the Reference Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing the Reference Index or make other methodological changes to the Reference Index that could affect the performance of the Futures Index. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the Futures Index and, consequently, the value of the Notes.

●The Performance of the Futures Index Will Differ from the Performance of the Reference Index—A variety of factors can lead to a disparity between the performance of an equity index futures contract and its reference index, including the expected dividend yields of the equity securities included in the reference index, an implicit financing cost associated with the futures contract and policies of the exchange on which the futures contracts are traded, such as margin requirements. A decline in expected dividends yields or an increase in margin requirements may adversely affect the performance of the Futures Index. In addition, the implicit financing cost will negatively affect the performance of the Futures Index, with a greater negative effect when market interest rates are higher. During periods of high market interest rates, the Futures Index is likely to underperform the Reference Index, perhaps significantly. The negative effect of the implicit financing cost will be magnified when the Index is exposed on a leveraged basis to the Futures Index.

●Negative Roll Returns Associated with the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index May Adversely Affect the Value of the Futures Index and the Value of the Notes—Unlike equity securities, the futures contracts composing the Futures Index, by their terms, have stated expirations. As the futures contracts composing the Futures Index approach expiration, they are replaced by contracts of the same series that have a later expiration. For example, a futures contract notionally purchased and held in June may specify a September expiration date. As time passes, the contract expiring in September is replaced by a contract for delivery in December. This is accomplished by notionally selling the September contract and notionally purchasing the December contract. This process is referred to as “rolling.” Excluding other considerations, if prices are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months, the notional purchase of the December contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price of the September contract, thereby creating a negative “roll return.” Negative roll returns adversely affect the returns on the futures contracts composing the Futures Index and, therefore, the value of the Futures Index and any payments on, and the value of, the Notes. Because of the potential effects of negative roll returns, it is possible for the value of the Futures Index to decrease significantly over time, even when the levels of the Reference Index are stable or increasing.

●The Futures Index Is Subject to Significant Risks Associated with Futures Markets—Futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, the participation of speculators and government regulation and intervention. In addition, futures exchanges generally have regulations that limit the amount of the futures contract price fluctuations that may occur in a single day. These limits are generally referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of those limits is referred to as a “limit price.” Once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit, or trading may be limited for a set period of time. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at potentially disadvantageous times or prices. These circumstances could delay the calculation of the value of the Futures Index. These factors and others can cause the prices of the futures contracts composing the Futures Index to be volatile and could adversely affect the value of the Futures Index and any payments on, and the value of, your Notes.

●There Are Risks Associated with Investments in Securities Linked to the Value of Non-U.S. Equity Securities—Some of the equity securities composing the Reference Index are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Furthermore, the role played by Barclays Index Administration in its role as Index Sponsor creates additional conflicts of interest. See “—Risks Relating to the Underlier Generally—The Index Sponsor Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Closing Value of the Index and the Amount Payable on the Notes and their Market Value and Create Conflicts of Interest” above.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe value and expected volatility of the Underlier;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

odividend rates on the securities included in the Reference Index;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing topurchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.”

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you hold the Notes for more than one year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:02.761420

It has risen nearly 200% over the past three years. And it has rallied more than 500% over the past five years. If you bought this stock five years ago, you have benefited from its skyrocketing rise. What's behind this performance, and can it last?

Eli Lilly takes the lead from Novo Nordisk

The big story surrounding Eli Lilly is its leading position in the GLP-1 weight loss drug market. Its two GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have been massive hits. In fact, in the third quarter of 2025, Mounjaro's sales rose a huge 109% year over year. That astounding growth was eclipsed by Zepbound, which saw sales increase a shocking 185% in the quarter.

Sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound have been such a powerful driver of Eli Lilly's performance that they made up 57% of the company's sales in the third quarter of 2025. What's interesting here is that Eli Lilly was actually the second pharmaceutical company to market with a GLP-1 drug. The first to market was Novo Nordisk (NVO +1.92%).

The facts just laid out set the stage for the story behind the hidden risk that investors face with Eli Lilly's soaring stock. The unfortunate part is that the risk is, really, just business as usual in the highly competitive, technical, and regulated healthcare sector.

What happens if Eli Lilly isn't the GLP-1 king?

It is clear that Wall Street is rewarding Eli Lilly for its dominance in the GLP-1 space. While the stock's 53 times price-to-earnings ratio isn't out of line with its five-year average for this metric, it is far above the average pharma stock's P/E of around 30 times. If that dominance were to be challenged or lost, investors would likely react by repricing the shares, ultimately affording them a lower valuation.

The first sign of such a threat is already here, as Novo Nordisk received FDA approval to sell a pill version of its GLP-1 drug. GLP-1 shots have been a bit hit, but people prefer pills over shots. It wouldn't be surprising to see Novo Nordisk's pill regain some market share from Eli Lilly. This type of innovation is relatively common in the pharmaceutical industry. Eli Lilly's GLP-1 offering was, basically, just a better product, and it quickly gained a leading market position.

There's a very real possibility that Eli Lilly's GLP-1 drugs could lose ground to a more effective weight loss drug or a more convenient delivery method. To be fair, Eli Lilly isn't sitting around doing nothing. It is also working on a pill, but so are other companies.

For example, Pfizer (PFE +0.71%) just acquired a company with a promising weight-loss drug pipeline, and it agreed to distribute a Chinese company's GLP-1 pill if that pill is approved.

This risk is exacerbated by the fact that Eli Lilly is so heavily reliant on GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound to support its top line. However, there's a risk to consider even if Eli Lilly remains the dominant GLP-1 company. Pharmaceutical companies are granted a time-limited period of exclusivity to sell drugs they discover. That's meant to help the companies recoup the costs of developing important drugs. When patent protection expires, however, companies often face what is known as a patent cliff.

A patent cliff occurs when generic versions of a blockbuster drug begin to pull sales away from the original blockbuster. While Eli Lilly has a while to go before it faces a patent cliff with Mounjaro and Zepbound, it is inevitable that it will eventually face one. Given the importance of these two drugs to the company's income statement, the loss of patent protection will pose a significant problem.

Enjoy the ride with Eli Lilly while it lasts

While there is no way to predict the future, Eli Lilly faces very clear risks. None of the risks, however, is unusual for a drug company. The major issue is that the risks are exacerbated by the significance of Mounjaro and Zepbound to Eli Lilly's business. If you own or buy Eli Lilly because of its leading position in the GLP-1 drug space, you should carefully consider a future in which the company's GLP-1 drugs aren't as important to the world and the company as they are today.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849520%2F25_02_28-people-in-business-attire-leaving-the-starting-line-on-a-track-_mf-dload-gettyimages-89285817-1200x800-5b2df79.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:30.094422

""Hatch brings the depth, discipline, and proven execution capability required to responsibly deliver the Stibnite Gold Project,"" said Jon Cherry, President and CEO of Perpetua Resources.","The Western world is entering a strategic race to secure domestic supplies of critical minerals, creating a compelling opportunity set for investors focused on resource security and long-term value for active miners that include Military Metals Corp. (OTCQB: MILIF) (CSE: MILI), Perpetua Resources Corp. (NASDAQ: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA), United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY), MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML). Antimony and gold are moving to the forefront as strategically vital materials: antimony for defense systems, semiconductors, and advanced energy applications, and gold for financial stability, electronics, and secure communications. With global supply highly concentrated outside the U.S. and its allies, these markets are increasingly shaped by geopolitical risk, positioning domestic producers as scarce, strategic assets with growing pricing power. Chinese export restrictions of metals such as antimony have further exposed the vulnerability of Western supply chains, reinforcing the urgency for domestically anchored alternatives. From a market value perspective, critical minerals represent a rapidly expanding investment theme measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars globally, with demand expected to accelerate through the next decade. Gold remains one of the largest and most liquid commodity markets in the world, valued in the trillions with consistent institutional demand, while antimony—though smaller in absolute size—commands premium pricing due to its limited supply base and lack of substitutes in many defense and industrial applications. As supply constraints tighten and governments prioritize secure sourcing, both metals are poised to benefit from structurally higher prices and long-term demand visibility, enhancing project economics for domestic producers. Securing domestic supply from allied jurisdictions has become a cornerstone of this strategy, reinforcing resilience by prioritizing production in politically stable, transparent, and defense-aligned countries.

For investors, the U.S. government's evolving approach significantly improves the risk-reward profile of domestic critical minerals projects. Direct federal support—through grants, low-cost financing, offtake agreements, and potential equity participation—is reducing capital risk and accelerating development timelines. Complementary policies such as tax incentives, permitting reform, Defense Production Act funding, and strategic stockpiling are creating clearer demand signals and more predictable revenue frameworks. As capital increasingly flows toward assets aligned with national security and supply chain resilience, domestic antimony and gold projects offer investors exposure to policy-backed growth, downside protection, and the potential for premium valuations as strategic scarcity intensifies.

Military Metals Drills 23.2 Meters of 2.22% Antimony including 7.9 Meters of 4.9% Antimony and 23.2 Meters of 1.27 g/t Gold Including 6.2 Meters of 3.17 g/t Gold at Flagship Trojarová Project - Military Metals Corp. (CSE: MILI) (OTCQB: MILIF) (FSE: QN90) (the ""Company"" or ""MILI""), is pleased to report the first analytical results of the Company's definition drilling campaign at the 100% owned flagship Trojarová Antimony Gold Project (the ""Project"") in Slovakia as announced on November 4, 2025. The holes were designed to confirm historical drilling results and to support SLR Consulting's work towards establishing a current mineral resource estimate on the Project. These priority assay results represent the main mineralized zone from the first hole of the program, 25-TVA-001.

Highlights of the Results from hole 25-TVA-001 Include:

23.2 drilled meters (m) of 2.22 % Antimony (Sb) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m

Including: 7.9m of 4.9% Sb over a true width of 6.8m from 152.7m to 160.6m

23.2m of 1.27 g/t Gold (Au) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m

Including: 6.2m of 3.17 g/t Au over true width of 5.4m from 160.6m to 166.8m

Scott Eldridge, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, ""We are thrilled by these first results from the Trojarová Antimony Gold Project confirmation drilling campaign. This validation of the quality and continuity of historical results provides crucial confidence as we proceed with the completion of the project's first modern Mineral Resource Estimate which is expected to be completed by SLR Consulting this quarter. We are confirming that Trojarová hosts antimony mineralization consistent with earlier work but now supported by contemporary assays. In the context of Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act, these results underscore Trojarová's potential to become a strategically important antimony project for the European Union at a time when secure, domestic supply of critical minerals has never been more important. Trojarová stands out as the only known antimony project in Europe with extensive historical drilling that can now be supported by modern drilling and assays. This combination significantly enhances the project's strategic relevance as the EU works to secure reliable, home-grown supply of critical minerals.""

The Company is working to complete the logging and sampling of the remaining drill core and to expedite the release of complete assay results as quickly as possible. Further details of the complete drill program will be included in future releases as the campaign's data is verified and finalized including professional location surveys of final drillhole collar locations.

The complete results, (outlined in Table 1 to be viewed in actual press release), show a distinct metal zonation within the main zone. Antimony and gold mineralization are consistently present throughout the main zone with a distinct 7.9m interval of Antimony enrichment from 152.7m to 160.6m immediately overlying a 6.2m interval of gold enrichment between 160.6m and 166.8m. Antimony values in the enriched interval range from 0.76% to 12.8%. Gold values in the enriched interval range from 1.26 g/t to 10.45 g/t.

History of the Project and Historical Resource - Discovered nearly fifty years ago, Trojarová was the focus of extensive surface and underground exploration over 2km of strike length between 1983 and 1995, including 63 diamond drillholes totaling 14,330 meters, and 1.7 kilometers of underground workings. Historical exploration efforts culminated in a historical mineral resource estimate published by the Slovak Geological institute in 1992 (see ""Historical Resource Estimates"" in the press release issued today). Per this historical estimate, at a cut-off grade of 1.0% antimony, Trojarová hosts 2.46 million tonnes averaging 2.47% antimony and 0.635 grams per tonne gold in a mineralized zone averaging 3.32 meters wide, containing approximately 60,000 tonnes of antimony in situ.

The historical estimate at Trojarová was classified using the Slovak version of the newly post-Soviet Russian classification system, which uses categories not directly comparable to modern standards as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy & Petroluem (""CIM"") Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves. The Slovak Geological Institute, the State agency that carried out all exploration and underground development work at Trojarová, classified the resource as ""P1"" in the Slovak version of the Russian classification system. P1 is most comparable in CIM's classification system to ""Inferred Mineral Resources,"" which is defined by the CIM as that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current, and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current. For additional information relating to the historical estimate see below under the heading ""Historical Resource Estimates"".

The Company announced January 8th, 2025, that SLR Consulting had been engaged to complete a modern mineral resource estimate of the Trojarová Project. The current drill program supports this work by seeking to confirm historical results and validate preliminary resource models.

Preliminary modelling of historical data indicates the Trojarová deposit may display a trend of thickening and increasing antimony grades to the NW. The Company has targeted projected extensions of the deposit along this vector with 3 of the 7 planned drillholes with the aim to expand the current extents of the known deposit.

The analysts project 2031 sales of the duo at $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
The once-daily oral treatment is set for a potential launch in 2027 and has the potential to become a “paradigm-changing treatment for B-cell malignancies,” the report notes.
The oral second-generation cereblon E3 ligase modulator could be a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who've previously been treated with immunomodulatory drugs, Clarivate said.
Clarivate also selected Otsuka’s voyxact, which is expected to launch in 2026 and generate $955 million in 2031 sales.","Eli Lilly has dominated headlines in recent months, recently taking the crown as the most valuable company in the biopharma industry by market cap. And the song remains much the same in analytics firm Clarivate's Drugs to Watch 2026 report.

The annual outlook, which identifies (PDF) 11 potential blockbusters and transformative medicines, highlights two cardiometabolic treatments from the Indianapolis company, which have yet to be approved but could ultimately take the place of its current cash cows Mounjaro and Zepbound.

Lilly’s investigational treatments are daily GLP-1 pill orforglipron, which is slated for an FDA decision by March of this year, and triple-action, weekly injection retatrutide, which Clarivate expects will be ready for launch in 2028.

Both assets are under development in obesity, diabetes and a host of other related indications.

The Clarivate analysts project sales of orforglipron will reach a whopping $16 billion in 2031 and that retatrutide will generate revenue of $30 billion in the same year, an astounding figure which includes $10 billion in sales as an obesity treatment and $20 billion as a medicine for diabetes.

Clarivate’s report highlights the continued ascent of the obesity and metabolic disease market, as well as how Lilly has positioned itself to take full advantage. Morgan Stanley projects the overall cardiometabolic medicine market will reach $150 billion by 2035.

“The GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) revolution is entering a new phase of maturation and diversification,” Clarivate wrote. “Orforglipron and retatrutide exemplify the next generation of metabolic therapies: oral formulations that promise improved adherence, triple-hormone mechanisms that deliver superior weight loss and expanded therapeutic applications spanning from brain health to renal disease.”

As for the 2031 sales projections of the drugs on Clarivate’s 2026 list, orforglipron and retatrutide eclipse all others. The remaining medicines Clarivate highlighted have much lower sales projections than Lilly's, with no others expected to surpass the $2-billion threshold in 2031, according to Clarivate’s reckoning.

Johnson & Johnson is the only other company with two drugs named—bladder cancer treatment Inlexzo, which gained FDA approval in September of last year, and immunotherapy icotrokinra, which Clarivate expects will be launched this year. The analysts project 2031 sales of the duo at $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.

Inlexzo made the grade with Clarivate for its bladder-sparing, “paradigm-shifting” drug-releasing system, which allows for extended release of the chemotherapy gemcitabine directly to patients' bladders through an intravesical system that can be placed in minutes in an outpatient setting.

Icotrokinra, meanwhile, is poised to become the first-to-market targeted oral peptide designed to block the interleukin (IL)-23 receptor, which plays a key role in the inflammatory process in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis as well as ulcerative colitis, Clarivate said.

Clarivate also singled out two protein degrader cancer drugs, including BeOne Medicine’s BGB-16673. The once-daily oral treatment is set for a potential launch in 2027 and has the potential to become a “paradigm-changing treatment for B-cell malignancies,” the report notes. The asset could be effective at treating multiple hematological cancers as well, according to the analysts. Clarivate projects the drug's sales at $1.2 billion in 2031.

The other protein degrader on Clarivate's radar is Bristol Myers Squibb’s mezigdomide, which is expected to launch in 2026 and could generate $1.5 billion in 2031. The oral second-generation cereblon E3 ligase modulator could be a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who've previously been treated with immunomodulatory drugs, Clarivate said.

Yet another oncology drug on the list comes in the form of Celcuity’s gedatolisib, which is set up for launch this year and is expected to deliver $1.1 billion in sales in 2031.

Clarivate also selected Otsuka’s voyxact, which is expected to launch in 2026 and generate $955 million in 2031 sales. The first-in-class selective A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) inhibitor could serve as a “high-impact, disease-modifying entrant"" in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger’s disease, the Clarivate team predicts.

The analytics team made another rare disease pick in GSK’s Exdensur, which was approved in December and is expected to generate sales of $510 million in 2031. The monoclonal antibody, which targets IL-5, is the first approved ultra-long-acting biologic with a six-month dosing schedule for severe asthma, providing greater convenience over currently available IL-5 inhibitors that require monthly or bimonthly dosing.

Also on Clarivate’s list are two drugs that recently suffered untimely rejections from the FDA. Sanofi’s multiple sclerosis treatment tolebrutinib is a potential first-in-class, brain-penetrant Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. But its prospects have been dampened by both efficacy and safety concerns raised in an FDA complete response letter (CRL).",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-486691192.jpg?VersionId=D1l6TNpezWwcJX_KqmWnaiIJECgJArJS,N,,2026-01-07 12:01:20.786882

Traders may take a step back from the markets following the advance seen to start the first full trading week of the new year.

However, it is worth noting that the futures were pointing to a roughly flat open on Tuesday before the Dow and the S&P 500 both climbed to new record closing highs over the course of the session.

The futures remained little changed after payroll processor ADP released a report showing private sector employment in the U.S. increased by slightly less than expected in the month of December.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 41,000 jobs in December after falling by a revised 29,000 jobs in November.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 47,000 jobs compared to the loss of 32,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

""Small establishments recovered from November job losses with positive end-of-year hiring, even as large employers pulled back,"" said ADP chief economist Dr. Nela Richardson.

After turning in a strong performance to kick off the first full trading week of the new year, stocks saw further upside during trading on Tuesday. With the continued upward move, the Dow and the S&P 500 reached new record closing highs.

The major averages ended the day just off their highs of the session. The Dow jumped 484.90 points or 1.0 percent to 49,462.08, the Nasdaq climbed 151.35 points or 0.7 percent to 23,547.17 and the S&P 500 rose 42.77 points or 0.6 percent to 6,944.82.

The Dow benefitted from a sharp increase by shares of Amazon (AMZN), with the online retail giant surging by 3.4 percent.

Amazon jumped to a new record closing high after announcing it is rolling out Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers in what is seen as an effort to more directly compete with ChatGPT and Gemini.

Strong gains by Amgen (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM) and IBM Corp. (IBM) also contributed to the jump by the blue chip index.

The continued advance by the broader markets came despite a lack of major catalysts, as traders look ahead to the release of several key U.S. economic reports in the coming days.

The highlight of the week is likely to be the release of the Labor Department's closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.

The data could impact the outlook for interest rates ahead of the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy meeting later this month.

While the Fed is likely to leave rates unchanged at its January 27-28 meeting, the central bank is widely expected to cut rates by at least another quarter point in the coming months.

Computer hardware stocks turned in some of the market's best performances on the day, with the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index soaring by 4.3 percent.

A sharp increase by the price of gold also contributed to substantial strength among gold stocks, as reflected by the 4.1 percent surge by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index.

Biotechnology stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, resulting in a 3.0 percent jump by the NSYE Arca Biotechnology Index.

Semiconductor, retail and healthcare stocks also showed notable moves to the upside, while significant weakness was visible among energy stocks amid a pullback by the price of crude oil.

The dollar moved in a tight range as investors looked ahead to the release of some key U.S. economic readings this week that could set the tone for the Federal Reserve's rate outlook.

The AI Marketing Cloud provider revealed that the collaboration would utilize OpenAI’s models to power conversational intelligence and agentic functions into the product.

This partnership will further enable Zeta to increase the speed at which it understands the customer market and how its strategies are driving meaningful engagement.

David A. Steinberg, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Zeta Global, explained how this collaboration would allow Zeta to expand its vision for Athena and its role in the enterprise marketing sector.

“AI is moving from the edges of marketing to the center of how enterprises operate, and Athena embodies that shift,” he said.

“It transforms the Zeta Marketing Platform into an intelligent operating system for growth – one that can listen, reason, and act on behalf of marketers.

“Together with OpenAI, we’re making this new way of working easy to adopt and scale, so brands can move faster, spend smarter, and win the moments that matter most.”

By utilizing OpenAI’s models for Athena, this will allow Zeta Global to input more natural conversational responses and decision-ready answers directly into marketing workflows.

Athena is embedded within the Zeta Marketing Platform, meaning that when in use, marketers are not required to switch between analytics tools, dashboards, or reporting systems, allowing analysis and execution to remain connected.

Athena will interpret the data and present possible conclusions that turn raw metrics into summarized insights with clear implications. This allows marketing teams to ask Athena questions on audience responses, email performance, or conversion rates declines, and in return receive actionable insights without needing multiple tools.

Furthermore, Zeta will also be expanding early beta access for its two Athena applications, Insights and Advisor, responding to customer uptake in adoption interest.

So, let’s take a closer look at what customers can expect from these solutions:

Insights with Athena

This application can be used by marketers as a conversational analytics assistant. Marketing teams can ask audience and product performance-related questions, as well as research possible trends and opportunities in plain language to receive instant, insight-heavy results.

Athena utilizes OpenAI’s models to pull relevant data, trends, and insights to generate answers, visualizations, and dashboards.

It can also identify shifts in customer behavior and engagement patterns across multiple channels, eliminating the need for manual database creation or navigating multiple tools for faster, more intuitive insight gathering.

Advisor with Athena

This app functions as an AI marketing strategist, utilizing goal-driven optimization capabilities to review ongoing marketing campaigns, performance metrics, and historical data. From here, it can recommend next steps to adjust targeting, modify creative content, or budget reallocating to improve outcomes.

In limited circumstances, Athena can automatically execute actions in configured accurately, including sending revised campaigns to selected audiences or launching follow-up sequences.

By automating analysis and decision-making, the app can advise marketing teams to act on insights quickly without waiting for manual reports to come in.

Giancarlo ‘GC’ Lionetti, Chief Commercial Officer at OpenAI, emphasizes how this partnership will allow Zeta Global to expand its data analysis capabilities with AI.

“Zeta shows how advanced AI moves beyond insight and into action,” he said.

“By working together, we are bringing agentic intelligence directly into everyday marketing workflows, helping enterprises move faster and act with confidence.”

What This Means For The Customer Journey

By implementing the Insights app, marketing teams can now deliver faster insights into customer trends, behavior, and campaign performance.

Decisions regarding targeting, messages, and offers can now also be made in near real-time, allowing campaigns to be optimized quickly during the conversion stage and increasing the likelihood of purchase.

This ensures that delays between observation and action are minimized, enabling marketing to respond faster to changing customer behavior throughout the journey.

Advisor ensures that customers are receiving more personalized engagement during the customer journey. By recommending actions targeted toward the consumer, the app can tailor campaigns automatically to an individual customer or segment, enhancing customer relationships throughout the journey and increasing loyalty post-purchase.

This trend, to support software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM) services, is directly linked to AI and computer vision.

More than eight out of ten organisations believe that software-defined products and services, and not just the physical vehicle, will become their main value proposition. Although the goals are ambitious, less than half of these companies have ramped up their SDM initiatives by 2025: 34% have partially ramped up at least one SDM use case, and only 14% have achieved large-scale implementation.

According to the research, organisations in the automotive sector increasingly recognise the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with large technology companies and hyperscalers to gain critical software, cloud and data capabilities.

AI as a source of innovation

The report highlights that 85% agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, directly integrated into software features and functions, from enhancing the in-vehicle experience to enabling advanced safety and cybersecurity features.

77% believe that the integration of AI into software development, in-vehicle features and mobility services is a key competitive advantage that will transform the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, increasing productivity and efficiency, and improving product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation.

Implications of these advances for the near future

Both AI and computer vision implemented in the automotive industry have major safety considerations and a growing demand for autonomous driving.

These advances mean greater safety in both assisted (ADAS) and automated driving, thanks to perception systems that are more accurate, reliable under difficult conditions and capable of reacting in real time. In addition, they are democratising advanced assisted driving; thanks to cheaper and more modular AI vision solutions, technologies that previously only existed in high-end ranges could reach more popular cars.

On the other hand, with software-defined vehicles (SDVs), vehicles will no longer be a ‘sum of independent parts’ but will become unified software platforms, facilitating updates, new features, customisation and remote maintenance. We also find that, with advances in 3D perception, sensor fusion, robustness in adverse conditions, and AI control systems, computer vision is laying the foundation for higher-level autonomous cars, especially in controlled environments.

Not only that, but new implications are also emerging in the industry with greater automation in production and quality control, which can translate into safer, more consistent vehicles and more efficient and sustainable manufacturing.

Recent major advances

Stradvision, which specialises in advanced 3D vision for ADAS and autonomous driving,

has been recognised in 2025 as a ‘Top SME Innovator’ by CLEPA, thanks to its AI-based perception technology, SVNet 3D Perception Network. This system allows for high-fidelity 3D understanding of the vehicle's environment, even under difficult conditions (low light, adverse weather).

With SVNet, manufacturers can offer driver assistance and partial/more advanced automation features at a lower cost, bringing 3D ADAS to more vehicle ranges. SVNet is designed to deliver higher fidelity spatial understanding, robust real-time object classification, and improved performance in low light and adverse weather conditions, enabling next-generation autonomous driving platforms. The technology is optimised to offer deployment flexibility across multiple SoCs and vehicle segments.

In addition, CES 2025 showcased its integration with the Texas Instruments TDA4VPE-Q1 automotive chip, optimised for Level 2/2+ ADAS (advanced assistance, automatic parking, 3D perimeter vision, etc.). This means that technologies previously reserved for expensive vehicles can now be implemented in a scalable manner.

AI-powered driver and occupant monitoring

Seeing Machines' DMS and OMS technology can be found integrated into a number of demonstrations from leading customers and partners, who will also be present at CES. This includes the company's Guardian Generation 3 software, which will be showcased at Ambarella's invitation-only exhibition. Seeing Machines' next-generation driver safety solution leverages Ambarella's CV25 AI SoC to deliver industry-leading AI performance per watt, enabling the company to improve Guardian's overall performance for commercial vehicles while enhancing global road safety and helping its customers comply with new regulations, including those currently in force in Europe.

In collaboration with QNX, Seeing Machines is integrating its QNX Cabin interior sensing technology, where the company's advanced algorithms will be leveraged to enable OEMs to monitor driver drowsiness and distraction, mitigating the risks associated with unsafe driving and enabling compliance with international safety regulations.

New SDV architectures and centralisation of intelligence

Visteon has launched its cognitoAI tool which, unlike other cloud-based AI systems for cars, resides directly in the vehicle. This system processes everything locally to deliver ultra-fast responses; continuously analyses vehicle data to provide useful information about the vehicle's condition and performance; learns and adapts to your driving habits over time; integrates data from multiple vehicle systems to make smarter decisions; and enables state-of-the-art voice interactions without the need for an internet connection.

This new platform manages multiple critical functions simultaneously. Think of it as the car's brain, managing advanced driver assistance with enhanced visualisation, high-fidelity 3D controls for vehicle functions, augmented reality navigation, AI-powered driver monitoring and Android-based entertainment systems. And it does all this while maintaining maximum performance and reliability.

Visteon is making vehicle interaction more enjoyable thanks to three key innovations: curved OLED displays: crisp information that adapts to the natural contours of the car; active privacy features: keeping confidential information visible only to those who need to see it, to avoid distractions; Deco Trim: controls hidden within decorative surfaces; no cluttered dashboards.

Toolchain

Continental's Road to Cloud Ecosystem approach to SDVs provides a comprehensive toolchain to simplify and accelerate vehicle software development. With the electrical backbone of SDVs, users will see the interaction and connection of hardware enablers, while the Continental Automotive Edge Framework and virtualisation highlight the developer workbench, cloud solutions and seamless integration into high-performance computers (HPC) and zone control units.

Other software solutions for future mobility, such as Cabin Sensing, Holistic Motion Control, Radar Vision Parking and Smart Device-based Vehicle Access, further expand the capabilities of SDV. The range of possibilities for SDV is unveiled with Continental's Intelligent Vehicle Experience, a smart vehicle that senses its surroundings, anticipates user intentions and interacts with the user. Sensors in existing vehicles, combined with artificial intelligence algorithms, offer a system solution for the new SDV architecture and provide a highly personalised user experience.

Serving production and business

At the Bosch Tech Day at the end of October, the company showcased artificial intelligence (AI) as a lever for industrial and social transformation. The firm has been implementing AI in its factories for decades to speed up production, optimise processes and reduce errors. A clear example was the automation of state-of-the-art sensor lines, where algorithms replaced repetitive tasks previously performed by operators, allowing them to focus on higher value-added functions.

They explained the difference between weak and strong AI and the role of generative AI in creating synthetic data, which is essential for training algorithms in environments with few real failures. They also highlighted how Bosch applies AI in predictive maintenance, automatic processing robots and alert classification, improving efficiency and safety in factories and vehicles.

In terms of human talent, it was noted that digitalisation generates new job opportunities: data scientists and engineers, profiles with training in physics and mathematics, and experts in technological ethics who previously had no clear prospects in the job market now find a place in the digitalised industry. Collaboration with universities, start-ups and technology consortia was also highlighted as a key element in accelerating innovation.

Volkswagen and productive AI

In preparation for vehicle production for a future driven by artificial intelligence, Volkswagen and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have extended their collaboration on the Digital Production Platform (DPP), Volkswagen's “factory cloud” designed to support car manufacturing, for another five years.

Volkswagen uses the DPP to implement cutting-edge AI and IT systems across all its global production plants. This makes production more flexible and faster, reduces IT costs, and helps bring new models to market more quickly.

Originally launched as a network of industrial partners, Volkswagen and AWS have turned the DPP into a key digital link that helps connect order intake, logistics, and manufacturing, helping to ensure a seamless flow of data throughout the entire process chain. This is a fundamental prerequisite for the widespread use of AI, one of the company's key strategic goals. In addition, the DPP helps Volkswagen implement new IT systems as standardised solutions across all its factories.

Across the Volkswagen Group, 43 plants in Europe, North America and South America are already connected to the DPP. In total, the Volkswagen Group operates 114 production plants worldwide.

The high availability and scalability of AWS help Volkswagen host these production-critical systems in the cloud and contribute to reducing the risk of production line downtime. Thanks to greater standardisation of systems across all plants, the Volkswagen Group is already achieving medium-term savings in the tens of millions. At the same time, these standards help to create a unified, multifunctional database – enabling even more consistent use of technologies such as AI. For example, with ‘KI4UPS’, Volkswagen leverages AI to assist assembly line teams in implementing vehicle software, identifying potential electronic problems more quickly. This contributes to a substantial reduction in Volkswagen's manual workload.

The Volkswagen Group currently uses more than 1,200 AI applications – far beyond the realm of production. Through innovative AWS services such as Amazon SageMaker, Volkswagen trains AI models and creates industrial computer vision use cases that improve quality control systems and reduce costs. These AI applications include sustainability initiatives: at the Poznań plant in Poland, for example, AI is used to help optimise electricity consumption. As a result, energy costs have been reduced by 12%, along with a decrease in CO₂ emissions.

Key AI trends in the automotive industry

Several AI-driven trends have been transforming development and operations throughout 2025.

Predictive thermal control in electric vehicle propulsion systems

When discussing optimising the propulsion system of an electric vehicle, it is useful to first analyse what that system actually consists of. Essentially, it involves electric motors, batteries and a set of power electronics components — including on-board chargers, DC-DC or AC-DC converters and controllers — that work together to deliver power efficiently and reliably.

AI is already accelerating innovation in batteries, but it is also driving advances in these other components. For example, in electric motor design, AI is increasingly being used in material selection, simulation, and multivariable modelling to increase power, reduce weight, and improve overall efficiency. These optimisations directly translate into better performance and lower energy consumption.

Another significant development is the transition from 400-volt to 800-volt architectures. Early generations of BEVs typically used 400-volt motors and supporting electronics. Now, with the rapid advancement of technology, many original equipment manufacturers, especially in China, are migrating to 800 V systems, which enable significantly faster charging thanks to their ability to handle high-voltage current flows with capable power electronics, improved thermal performance, and greater overall efficiency.

Achieving these improvements requires compatible power electronics and motor designs, areas where AI-based design and validation tools are proving indispensable.

With accelerated battery design using AI-enabled platforms, AI algorithms and artificial intelligence applied to automotive are transforming battery development from start to finish. Engineers are using AI to improve thermal management and prevent risks such as overheating, which can lead to fires.

Machine learning models also guide the selection and optimisation of cell chemistry, striking a balance between fast charging capability and long-term durability. This allows batteries to accept high-voltage currents without accelerating chemical degradation.

In addition, AI is helping to increase energy density, enabling greater range without adding weight, and refining recharge cycles so that batteries last longer. These advances not only affect performance, but also shorten R&D cycles and reduce development costs.

In markets such as China, where new-generation electric vehicle manufacturers are leveraging AI to launch new products at a rapid pace, established vehicle manufacturers are being forced to accelerate their own innovation cycles. In markets such as China, where new-generation electric vehicle manufacturers are leveraging AI to launch new products at a rapid pace, established vehicle manufacturers are being forced to accelerate their own innovation cycles.

While battery design and development remain critical, the impact of AI goes beyond that. It is shaping the entire battery ecosystem. AI optimises supply chains for critical materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.

It also increases manufacturing efficiency by reducing production waste. In addition, AI improves recycling to recover valuable materials when electric vehicle batteries reach the end of their useful life. These applications highlight the broad potential of AI to make batteries more sustainable, cost-effective and resilient.

In factories and vehicle systems, AI enables rapid scenario testing. Incorporating digital twins into R&D processes enables early-stage validation, with layered data feedback loops that reduce downtime and development costs. Analysts can triangulate efficiency differences between original equipment manufacturers using these methods. By aligning design and manufacturing with these new paradigms, companies can systematically reduce time to market and support data-intensive product lines.

Según el informe “La era de la movilidad impulsada por el software: más allá de los vehículos”, del Instituto de Investigación de Capgemini, el 92% de las organizaciones del sector de la automoción prevén una transformación en empresas de software. Esta tendencia, para dar soporte a los vehículos definidos por software (SDV) y a los servicios de movilidad impulsados por software (SDM), está directamente entroncada con la IA y la visión artificial.

Como nos explica Johan Huss, Vice President Digital Products and Services en Sandvik Coromant, el futuro está en los modelos de negocio que eliminan la complejidad de la planta de producción y vinculan los costes directamente al rendimiento.

En virtud de la norma FMVSS 127, la Administración Nacional de Seguridad Vial en Carreteras de Estados Unidos (NHTSA) exige que, a partir del 1 de septiembre de 2029, todos los turismos y camiones ligeros nuevos vendidos en los Estados Unidos estén equipados con sistemas de alerta de colisión frontal (FCW) y de frenado automático de emergencia (AEB).

In federal district court in Delaware, Bayer filed one complaint against Moderna and another against partners Pfizer and BioNTech. In U.S. district court in New Jersey, Bayer also is suing Johnson & Johnson.

The lawsuits allege that the defendants used Bayer’s technology in creating their vaccines “to eliminate ‘problem’ coding sequences in the building blocks of cells to improve mRNA stability and the amount or quality of protein produced.”

Pfizer and J&J did not respond to a request for comment. Moderna and BioNTech responded but only to say they were aware of the litigation.

Monsanto filed to protect its intellectual property in 1989, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office eventually granted it in 2010, according to the lawsuits. Bayer bought out Monsanto for $66 billion in 2016.

Monsanto initially used the technology to increase the expression of an insect-resistant protein in crops, which reduced the need for pesticide sprays and improved agricultural output, the lawsuits explained.

Instability leading to poor protein expression was a central issue the COVID-19 vaccine makers faced in developing their shots. Solving this helped enhance the vaccines' “ability to confer immunity to the virus,” Bayer wrote in its complaint against Pfizer/BioNTech, adding that the German biotech has “acknowledged that it utilizes codon optimization in its mRNA products.”

While J&J’s COVID shot—which is no longer available—was a traditional viral vector vaccine, it still needed increased mRNA stability for protein expression, according to Bayer.

Bayer is requesting a jury trial and is seeking a cut of the proceeds generated by the vaccines and royalties on future sales. In the case of Pfizer and BioNTech, Bayer said the companies reported more than $93 billion in sales of their vaccine Comirnaty.

Third Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Results

Net sales and other revenue increased 1.9% to $19,123.7 million for the 12 weeks ended November 29, 2025 (""third quarter of fiscal 2025"") from $18,774.5 million during the 12 weeks ended November 30, 2024 (""third quarter of fiscal 2024""). This increase was driven by a 2.4% increase in identical sales, with strong growth in pharmacy sales being the primary driver of the identical sales increase. We also continued to grow our digital sales with a 21% increase during the third quarter of fiscal 2025. These increases in Net sales and other revenue were partially offset by a net reduction in sales driven by store closures since the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and lower fuel sales. In addition, we estimate the temporary government shutdown and related delayed SNAP funding during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 negatively impacted identical sales by approximately 10 to 20 basis points.

Gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 27.9% during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of fuel and LIFO expense, gross margin rate decreased 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease in gross margin rate was driven by increases in delivery and handling costs related to the continued growth in our digital sales, and strong growth in pharmacy sales, which carries an overall lower gross margin rate. We also continue to make incremental investments in our customer value proposition which were funded by the benefits from our productivity initiatives.

Selling and administrative expenses decreased to 24.9% of Net sales and other revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 25.1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of fuel, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue decreased 33 basis points. This decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue was primarily attributable to the sales leveraging of employee costs and lower merger-related costs, partially offset by an increase in business transformation costs. The benefits from our productivity initiatives continue to partially offset increasing wage rates and other inflationary pressures on our operating expenses.

Net gain on property dispositions and impairment losses was $1.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to net loss of $10.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Interest expense, net was $116.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $109.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Other income, net was $4.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $5.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Income tax expense was $84.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, representing a 22.3% effective tax rate, compared to $14.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, representing a 3.5% effective tax rate. The increase in the effective rate was primarily driven by the recognition of $81.0 million of discrete state income tax benefits related to the settlement of audits during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Net income was $293.3 million, or $0.55 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $400.6 million, or $0.69 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 included the $81.0 million or $0.14 per share benefit related to certain discrete state income tax benefits related to the settlement of audits.

Adjusted net income was $390.3 million, or $0.72 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $420.3 million, or $0.71 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,038.7 million, or 5.4% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $1,065.1 million, or 5.7% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

On January 7, 2026, the Company announced the next quarterly dividend payment of $0.15 per share to be paid on February 6, 2026 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 23, 2026.

On October 14, 2025, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""ASR Agreement"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (""JPMorgan"") to repurchase $750 million of shares of the Company's common stock. Also on October 14, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion, inclusive of the ASR Agreement. On October 15, 2025, the Company paid JPMorgan $750.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 35.4 million shares of common stock with a value equal to $600.0 million as of the date the ASR Agreement was executed, representing an estimated 80% of the total shares initially underlying the ASR Agreement. The delivery of any remaining shares will occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement, which is expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock on specified dates during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, inclusive of the $750.0 million ASR Agreement, the Company invested $1,361.6 million for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the existing multi-year $2.75 billion repurchase authorization.

On November 10, 2025, the Company completed the issuance of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2031 (the ""2031 Notes"") and $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2034 (the ""2034 Notes"" and together with the 2031 Notes, the ""Notes""). Proceeds from the Notes were used to redeem in full the $750.0 million outstanding of the Company's 3.250% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2026 (the ""Redemption""), to repay a portion of the borrowings under the ABL Facility, and to pay fees and expenses related to the Redemption and the issuance of the Notes.

Fiscal 2025 Outlook

The Company is providing an updated fiscal 2025 outlook and expects its financial results to be as follows:

Identical sales growth in the range of 2.2% to 2.5% (previously 2.2% to 2.75%) (1)

Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.825 billion to $3.875 billion, including approximately $65 million related to the Company's 53rd week (previously $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion)

Adjusted net income per Class A common share in the range of $2.08 to $2.16 per share (previously $2.06 to $2.19 per share)

Effective income tax rate in the range of 23% to 24% (previously 23.5% to 24.5%)

Capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion (unchanged)

The Company is unable to provide a full reconciliation of the GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures (as defined below) used in the updated fiscal 2025 outlook without unreasonable effort because it is not possible to predict certain of the adjustment items with a reasonable degree of certainty. This information is dependent upon future events and may be outside of the Company's control and could have a significant impact on its GAAP financial results for fiscal 2025. The expected effective tax rate does not reflect potential future rate adjustments for the resolution of tax audits or potential changes in tax laws, which cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.

Conference Call

The Company will hold a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, which will be hosted by Susan Morris, CEO, and Sharon McCollam, President & CFO. The call will be webcast and can be accessed at https://albertsonscompanies.com/investors/events-and-presentations. A replay of the webcast will be available for at least two weeks following the completion of the call.

Non-GAAP Measures and Identical Sales

Non-GAAP Measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per Class A common share and Net debt ratio (collectively, the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are performance measures that provide supplemental information the Company believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin, and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the Company's ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Net debt ratio for board of director and bank compliance reporting. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Identical Sales. As used in this earnings release, the term ""identical sales"" includes stores operating during the same period in both the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year, comparing sales on a daily basis. Direct to consumer digital sales are included in identical sales, and fuel sales are excluded from identical sales.

Investing.com -- Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE: ACI) reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, while revenue came in slightly below estimates as the grocery chain continues to invest in digital growth and technology.

The supermarket operator posted adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share for the quarter ended November 29, beating the analyst consensus of $0.68. Revenue reached $19.12 billion, up 1.9% from the same period last year but falling short of the $19.18 billion analysts had expected. Identical store sales increased 2.4% YoY, driven primarily by strong pharmacy sales growth.

Prediction Market powered by

Shares of Albertsons dipped 0.5% following the earnings announcement.

""In the third quarter, we delivered solid results and continued to advance our strategic priorities,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer. ""Our investments in technology and AI are fundamentally reshaping how we operate and serve our customers; driving smarter decisions, greater efficiency, and more personalized experiences.""

Digital sales surged 21% during the quarter, while loyalty membership grew 12% to 49.8 million members. The company noted that the temporary government shutdown and related delayed SNAP funding negatively impacted identical sales by approximately 10 to 20 basis points during the quarter.

Gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% from 27.9% in the prior year period, primarily due to increased delivery and handling costs related to digital sales growth and the expansion of lower-margin pharmacy sales.

For fiscal 2025, Albertsons narrowed its identical sales growth forecast to between 2.2% and 2.5%, down from its previous guidance of 2.2% to 2.75%, partly due to the impact of Medicare’s Drug Price Negotiation Program. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.08 to $2.16, compared to the analyst consensus of $2.14.

“This 2025 holiday season, consumers embraced generative AI more than ever as a shopping assistant in their purchasing decisions,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights.","Record holiday season online, propelled by a strong Cyber Week

Consumers spent $257.8 billion online from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, up 6.8% year-over-year (YoY) and setting a new record for e-commerce. 25 days saw consumers spend more than $4 billion in a single day (a significant jump from 18 days in 2024). Mobile shopping hit a new milestone, with the majority of online transactions (56.4%) taking place through a smartphone this season (up from 54.5% in 2024); Mobile shopping was highest on Christmas Day (Dec. 25), driving 66.5% of online sales (vs. 65% in 2024), followed by Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 27) at 61.6% mobile share (vs. 59.3% in 2024).

Record online spending this season was bolstered by a strong Cyber Week (the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday), which brought in $44.2 billion online overall, up 7.7% YoY. Cyber Monday remained the biggest e-commerce day of the season (and year), driving $14.25 billion in online spend, up 7.1% YoY. Cyber Monday growth was outpaced by Black Friday ($11.8 billion, up 9.1% YoY), as consumers embraced earlier deals. On Thanksgiving Day, consumers spent $6.4 billion online, up 5.3% YoY.

Competitive discounts pushed consumers to ‘trade up’

Strong discounts this season drove resilient consumer demand online. Shoppers found great deals in electronics, where discounts peaked at 30.9% off listed price (vs. 30.1% in 2024), as well as toys at 29.6% (vs. 28%), apparel at 25.1% (vs. 23.2%), televisions at 24.3% (vs. 24.2%), computers at 23.4% (vs. 22.8%), sporting goods at 20.3% (vs. 19.5%), appliances at 20.2% (vs. 19.2%) and furniture at 18.8% (vs. 19%).

Deals this season also drove consumers to purchase higher-ticket items in categories such as electronics, sporting goods and appliances—propelling e-commerce growth as a result. This season, the share-of-units-sold for the most expensive goods increased by 20% compared to the rest of the year. Within categories, this figure was up 56% in electronics, 55% in sporting goods, 38% in appliances, 34% in personal care products and 29% in tools.

Generative AI reshaped the online shopping journey

Generative AI-powered chat services and browsers have become an integral tool for consumers to find deals and research products. This season, traffic to retail sites from generative AI tools (shoppers clicking on a link to a retail site) increased by 693.4% compared to the year prior. On Cyber Monday, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 670%. While the base of users remains modest, the uptick shows the value AI can deliver as a shopping assistant. These services were used most in categories including video games, toys, appliances, electronics and personal care products.

“This 2025 holiday season, consumers embraced generative AI more than ever as a shopping assistant in their purchasing decisions,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “Competitive discounts and flexible payment options like Buy Now Pay Later also contributed to driving record spend of $257.8 billion throughout this holiday season.”

The futures are trading flat on Wednesday after a second strong day for Wall Street, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another record high, closing over $49,000 for the first time at $49,484, up a solid 1.04%. The S&P 500 also posted a record high, closing at 6,947, up 0.66%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also scored a win on Tuesday, closing the day at 23,546, up 0.64%. Continued momentum from Monday carried stocks higher, plus solid economic news on multiple fronts also added to the bullish sentiment. Semiconductor stocks are still leading the technology charge, and many feel the top companies could post outstanding fourth-quarter earnings, which will start next week with the big money-center banks reporting. Plus, after hitting a wall at the end of 2025, AI and data center stocks have shown renewed momentum as investors chase more big gains in 2026.

Treasury Bonds:

Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve after a solid start to the week on Monday. While buying was seen in the shorter T-bill maturities, there was some modest selling across the middle and longer maturities. Investors are clearly focused on upcoming economic data and geopolitical events, such as developments in Venezuela. However, recent market shifts saw yields dip amid broader Fed uncertainty and tech bubble fears, creating a volatile environment for safe-haven assets. The 30-year long bond was last seen Tuesday at 4.85% while the benchmark ten-year note finished the day at 4.17%

Oil and Gas:

After a solid Monday, stocks were down across the energy complex, and some of the same worries from 2025 resurfaced on Tuesday as expectations of a global supply surplus in 2026 and the lack of immediate supply disruption from geopolitical tensions in Venezuela, as Chevron reported that it will keep Venezuelan oil flowing despite the political upheaval there. Traders are focused on market fundamentals, which point to ample supply and subdued demand concerns. Brent Crude closed at $60.49, down 2.06%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen at $56.91, down 2.42%. Natural gas also saw sellers reappear, as unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country was a factor. Nat gas closed at $3.40, down 3.43%.

Gold:

Gold and Silver continued their respective marches higher, albeit not as dramatically for Gold as some of the trading days we have seen recently, when both precious metals would bolt higher by 5-10% and more. The song remains the same as central bank buying, massive retail inflows, and geopolitical concerns continue to drive investors to chase both Gold and Silver. Gold closed the session up almost 1% at $4,492. However, Silver continued a hot streak, closing up 6.06% at $81.18.

Crypto:

Crypto markets traded mixed on Tuesday as investors remained cautious ahead of key macroeconomic data releases. Bitcoin pulled back slightly but generally held above the $91,000 to $92,000 range, while some altcoins like XRP and Solana posted notable gains. Many crypto analysts on Wall Street are starting to signal they feel the bottom after a sizable sell-off that began last year may be in the process of being put in. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $91,940, while Ethereum was trading at $3,212.

24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Here are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, January 7, 2026.

Market consolidation limits risk-taking, creating space for independent brands to lead meaningful change.

Specialty coffee roasters can drive real innovation by partnering with producers, collaborating beyond coffee, and developing value-led products.

Successful innovation strengthens financial resilience and supports the wider supply chain.

When specialty coffee first emerged, it redefined how coffee was grown, traded, and consumed. Quality and traceability became the differentiators, demonstrating how value commanded higher prices.

For a long time, these factors alone were enough for specialty coffee roasters. But today’s challenging market requires them to continue innovating.

At the same time, consolidation is reshaping the industry. In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper agreed to buy JDE Peet’s in a US$18bn deal. This will create the world’s second-largest coffee company, behind Nestlé, and shape the global coffee sector for years to come.

However, innovation thrives on risk, and consolidation at this level makes key players risk-averse. For specialty coffee roasters, this is an opportunity to push for genuine change that strengthens business resilience, exceeds consumer expectations, and supports the overall supply chain.

There are many ways for specialty coffee roasters to drive real innovation: mutually beneficial partnerships with producers, collaborations with brands outside the coffee industry, or the pioneering of new brewing techniques. Regardless of which direction they take, it needs to feel authentic, fresh, and relevant.

Specialty coffee roasters need to maintain momentum

Specialty coffee thrives on innovation, and we have seen plenty over the last two decades.

Flat whites, which became a status symbol in the 2000s for those “in the know” about specialty coffee culture, redefined traditional milk-based drinks. Brewing methods and experimental processing have also proliferated, creating unique flavour experiences. Specialty-grade capsules and instant coffee gained traction in the 2010s, offering both convenience and quality. The cold RTD coffee revolution is arguably still underway, introducing Gen Z consumers to higher-quality options.

Even with higher coffee prices, rising operational costs, and intensifying competition, roasters still need to maintain this momentum.

“Innovation matters because taste alone is too fragile a differentiator,” says Michael Cleland, the co-founder of Assembly Coffee in London, UK. “Quality has become baseline, and the whole industry is selling ‘specialty-grade ethical coffee’ in a market that’s struggling to sustain value.”

One way Assembly drives innovation is by collaborating with producers and research organisations to overcome challenges at origin and deepen understanding of coffee processing. In early 2025, the roaster partnered with Brazilian farm Mió and the Coffee Sensorium to utilise controlled fermentation to increase the quality of overripe cherries.

The result was a limited-edition drop of three coffees processed using three methods: carbonic maceration, yeast fermentation, and “volcanic” fermentation. Overripe coffee is typically discarded due to flavour and quality degradation, so the project allowed consumers to experience flavours that might otherwise be unattainable. Mió, meanwhile, addressed a climate-change-driven problem: rising temperatures are placing coffee plants under severe stress.

“Real innovation meets or exceeds expectations while increasing margin, and this gives businesses the resilience they need while everything else becomes harder,” Michael says. “Without this, they risk competing only on price, and a race to the bottom is a quick way to lose.”

But innovation has many definitions

Innovation conjures up images of unconventional processing techniques, hyper-minimalist packaging, and creative signature drinks. But not all roasters define it in the same way.

“I don’t see innovation as a primary ambition for us,” says Ian Bailey, the founder of Vivid Coffee in Burlington, Vermont, US. “We want to be known as an authentic expression of our values rather than as a brand that is always on the cutting edge.”

For Vivid, real change lies in translating values into tangible products. This begins with building direct sourcing relationships with producers that pay higher prices for exceptional quality.

“In many ways, it requires innovation to communicate these values authentically,” Ian says. “For us, it’s less about chasing trends and more about pursuing authenticity in our values and sourcing practices.”

This highlights a key tension within specialty coffee: how roasters can adapt to changing consumer behaviour while staying true to the ethical and quality-driven principles that define the sector.

Could coffee innovation return to its roots?

Consumer preferences are shifting, particularly among younger generations. Matcha drinks and customised beverages are growing in popularity, often at the expense of traditional black coffee. Research indicates that around 75% of younger consumers regularly add flavours to their drinks.

In response, some specialty coffee roasters are developing blends optimised for milk, sweeteners, and cold coffee, while others are creating in-house syrups and seasonal drinks. Cafés are experimenting with flavours such as corn cold foam and black sesame vanilla, inspired mainly by East Asian cuisine, to appeal to younger demographics without abandoning quality principles.

But instead, there could be potential to refocus on the drink that kickstarted the third wave coffee revolution: black filter coffee.

“Black filter coffee represents essence. It’s a longer drink that helps us perceive the full spectrum of flavours,” says Cosimo Libardo, the head of sales at equipment manufacturer Ceado. “In fact, it’s the beverage that best allows us to understand coffee’s complexity, much like a glass of red wine.

“It is the most critical opportunity to build education and culture. Yet it has been taken for granted,” he adds. “We need to bring it back to the centre stage, as the key to understanding and appreciating coffee.”

Ceado designed its radial infusion Hoop brewer to make filter coffee more accessible. Users add ground coffee to the Flow Tower and pour water into the Outer Loop to assist with more even extraction. For younger, more convenience-focused consumers, low-effort, high-yield brewing is more appealing than intricate multi-step pours.

Roasters can use this opportunity to simultaneously drive innovation and build black coffee’s appeal among Gen Z. Brands like Counter Culture, Onyx Coffee Lab, Klatch, and Black & White are partnering with companies such as Cometeer and xBloom to offer flash-frozen capsules and whole bean pods that simplify high-quality brewing.

Encouraging a shift to “tradition”

Price sensitivity may encourage more people to resume drinking black coffee, but roasters can find other ways to innovate and drive consumption.

“The truth is, it’s hard to make black coffee ‘Instagram special’. You can’t post the taste, so the real work has to go deeper,” says Vytautas Kratulis, the founder of Huracán Coffee, Lithuania’s first specialty coffee roastery.

Huracán collaborates with brands outside the coffee industry, including bean-to-bar chocolate companies, a distillery, and an ice cream manufacturer, demonstrating how diversification can strengthen business resilience, diversify revenue, and drive innovation.

The company recently received Gold and Bronze medals for its filter coffee at the European edition of the Global Coffee Awards.

“You educate, but sometimes it’s an invitation. You create an environment where drinking black coffee feels grown-up, confident, even exalted,” he adds. “A student might order it because they want to embody a more mature image, and batch brew is cheaper than customised drinks.”

A focus on black coffee’s health benefits could prove promising for stressed-out Gen Z, who increasingly prioritise their mental wellbeing.

Innovation in specialty coffee has no single definition. For some roasters, it means new products or formats. For others, it means refining sourcing models, improving sustainability, or strengthening storytelling.

What remains clear is that the future of specialty coffee depends on balance. Roasters must continue to honour the values that shaped the sector while finding new ways to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive and consolidated market. Those who succeed will be the ones who innovate with intention.

In the report, published Monday, the ratings agency said stablecoins processed about 87% more settlement volume in 2025 than the year before, reaching $9 trillion in activity based on industry estimates of onchain transactions, rather than purely bank‑to‑bank flows.

Moody’s said fiat‑backed stablecoins and tokenized deposits are evolving into “digital cash” for liquidity management, collateral movements and settlements across an increasingly tokenized financial system.

Stablecoins plug into institutional rails

Moody’s placed stablecoins alongside tokenized bonds, funds and credit products as part of a broader convergence between traditional and digital finance.

Banks, asset managers and market infrastructure providers spent 2025 running pilots on blockchain settlement networks, tokenization platforms and digital custody, seeking to streamline issuance, post‑trade processes and intraday liquidity management.

The report estimated that, across these initiatives, more than $300 billion could be invested in digital finance and infrastructure by 2030 as firms build out the rails for large‑scale tokenization and programmable settlement.

​Within that picture, stablecoins and tokenized deposits increasingly act as the settlement asset for cross‑border payments, repo (short-term secured loans where one party sells securities and agrees to buy them back later at a higher price) and collateral transfers.

Moody’s noted that regulated institutions used cash and US Treasury‑backed stablecoins in 2025 to facilitate intraday movements between funds, credit pools and trading venues, with trials in banks such as Citigroup and Société Générale, among others.

JPM Coin is cited as an example of a deposit token model that integrates programmable payments and liquidity management into existing banking infrastructure, illustrating how “digital cash” layers can sit on top of traditional core systems.

​Regulation and risks for “digital cash”

Regulation is starting to catch up with this shift. The report highlighted the European Union’s Markets in Crypto‑Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, US stablecoin and market structure proposals and licensing frameworks in Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates as evidence of a converging global approach to tokenization, custody and redemption rules.

In Europe, Société Générale‑Forge’s EURCV and related initiatives are cited as examples of bank-issued products developed under the EU’s emerging stablecoin framework, while in the Gulf, banks and regulators are exploring UAE dirham‑referenced payment tokens and broader digital money architectures.

​Still, Moody’s stressed that the transformation is far from risk‑free. As more value moves onto “digital rails,” the report warned that smart contract bugs, oracle failures, cyberattacks on custody systems and fragmentation across multiple blockchains could create new forms of operational and counterparty risk.

The agency argued that security, interoperability and governance will be just as important as regulatory clarity if stablecoins are to function as reliable institutional settlement assets rather than new sources of systemic vulnerability.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 11:14:10.182838

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simple stories you build around a company that connect your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and then to a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help decide whether it looks more like a buy, hold or sell for you.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, each Narrative turns your assumptions into a living model that automatically refreshes as new information such as earnings, news or guidance comes through. This means your fair value view is not frozen at the moment you first ran the numbers.

For Delta Air Lines, for example, one published Narrative currently points to a fair value of about US$49 per share, while another points to about US$74.61. This shows how two investors can look at exactly the same company and, based on different expectations for revenue growth, profit margins, discount rates and future P/E, arrive at quite different fair values that the platform then sets against the market price so you can see how your story lines up with what the market is paying today.

For Delta Air Lines, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Delta Air Lines Narratives:

These sit side by side, use different assumptions, and show you how reasonable investors can look at the same stock and land in different places on value and risk.

🐂 Delta Air Lines Bull Case

Fair value in this narrative: US$74.61 per share

Gap to that fair value at the current US$72.22 price: about 3.2% below the narrative fair value

Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 3.92% a year

Focuses on premium cabins, loyalty revenue and international routes as the key earnings drivers, with a long term maintenance deal adding another revenue stream.

Assumes modest revenue growth and slightly lower profit margins over time, with earnings reaching about US$4.6b and a future P/E of 12.9x by 2028.

Ties the analyst consensus price target of US$67.81 to these earnings and valuation assumptions, while highlighting risks from tariffs, softer domestic travel and pressure from low cost competitors.

🐻 Delta Air Lines Bear Case

Fair value in this narrative: US$59.84 per share

Gap to that fair value at the current US$72.22 price: about 20.6% above the narrative fair value

Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 3.5% a year

Frames Delta as a quality operator with strong yield and cost control, but questions how much investors should pay given thin margins and sector shocks that can hit demand and balance sheets.

Flags tariffs, trade tensions and softer travel appetite as key threats for both transatlantic and domestic routes, even for a carrier that currently leads US peers.

Uses a lower future P/E multiple of 10x to reflect these risks, which pulls fair value below the current share price despite recognising solid recent profitability and debt reduction.

Taken together, these Narratives give you a compact range of fair values and the assumptions behind them so you can decide which story, if either, lines up best with your own view on Delta Air Lines.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,038.7 million, or 5.4% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $1,065.1 million, or 5.7% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Capital Allocation and Common Stock Repurchase Program

During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, capital expenditures were $1,412.8 million, which primarily included the completion of 74 remodels, the opening of five new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company paid its quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on November 7, 2025 to stockholders of record as of October 24, 2025. On January 7, 2026, the Company announced the next quarterly dividend payment of $0.15 per share to be paid on February 6, 2026 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 23, 2026.

On October 14, 2025, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""ASR Agreement"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (""JPMorgan"") to repurchase $750 million of shares of the Company's common stock. Also on October 14, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion, inclusive of the ASR Agreement. On October 15, 2025, the Company paid JPMorgan $750.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 35.4 million shares of common stock with a value equal to $600.0 million as of the date the ASR Agreement was executed, representing an estimated 80% of the total shares initially underlying the ASR Agreement. The delivery of any remaining shares will occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement, which is expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock on specified dates during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, inclusive of the $750.0 million ASR Agreement, the Company invested $1,361.6 million for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the existing multi-year $2.75 billion repurchase authorization.

On November 10, 2025, the Company completed the issuance of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2031 (the ""2031 Notes"") and $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2034 (the ""2034 Notes"" and together with the 2031 Notes, the ""Notes""). Proceeds from the Notes were used to redeem in full the $750.0 million outstanding of the Company's 3.250% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2026 (the ""Redemption""), to repay a portion of the borrowings under the ABL Facility, and to pay fees and expenses related to the Redemption and the issuance of the Notes.

Fiscal 2025 Outlook

The Company is providing an updated fiscal 2025 outlook and expects its financial results to be as follows:

Identical sales growth in the range of 2.2% to 2.5% (previously 2.2% to 2.75%) (1)

Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.825 billion to $3.875 billion, including approximately $65 million related to the Company's 53rd week (previously $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion)

Adjusted net income per Class A common share in the range of $2.08 to $2.16 per share (previously $2.06 to $2.19 per share)

Effective income tax rate in the range of 23% to 24% (previously 23.5% to 24.5%)

Capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion (unchanged)

The Company is unable to provide a full reconciliation of the GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures (as defined below) used in the updated fiscal 2025 outlook without unreasonable effort because it is not possible to predict certain of the adjustment items with a reasonable degree of certainty. This information is dependent upon future events and may be outside of the Company's control and could have a significant impact on its GAAP financial results for fiscal 2025. The expected effective tax rate does not reflect potential future rate adjustments for the resolution of tax audits or potential changes in tax laws, which cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.

Non-GAAP Measures and Identical Sales

Non-GAAP Measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per Class A common share and Net debt ratio (collectively, the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are performance measures that provide supplemental information the Company believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin, and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the Company's ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Net debt ratio for board of director and bank compliance reporting. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Identical Sales. As used in this earnings release, the term ""identical sales"" includes stores operating during the same period in both the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year, comparing sales on a daily basis. Direct to consumer digital sales are included in identical sales, and fuel sales are excluded from identical sales.

The strategy reflects growing confidence that voice could become a primary interface for AI systems embedded in homes, vehicles, workplaces and autonomous machines.

From Novelty Interfaces to Production Systems

Voice interaction is not new, but the reported direction marks a shift away from command-based assistants toward full-duplex conversational AI: systems capable of interrupting, responding in real time and managing dialogue more fluidly.

The Information reported that OpenAI had consolidated several internal research and product teams into a dedicated audio initiative, aimed at improving latency, turn-taking and conversational flow. These are areas where audio interfaces have historically lagged behind text-based models. These improvements were described as prerequisites for deploying voice AI in continuous, production-grade environments, rather than as experimental features.

This evolution is particularly relevant for robotics and embodied AI, where speech must function reliably alongside sensors, motion control, and decision-making systems. In these settings, audio becomes an operational interface rather than a convenience layer.

Enterprise and Commercial Implications

Beyond consumer devices, OpenAI’s reported audio strategy has implications for enterprise software, customer operations, and industrial automation.

The reporting suggested that OpenAI’s planned audio model was intended to support persistent, always-on interaction, allowing AI systems to remain context-aware without requiring explicit prompts. For businesses, this capability could enable new classes of AI agents to operate within workflows such as customer service, logistics, healthcare support and field operations. This is contingent on latency, compliance and reliability thresholds being met.

This positions audio AI as a potential bridge between cloud-hosted intelligence and edge-deployed systems, particularly in environments where screens are impractical, unsafe or distracting.

Latency, Trust and Infrastructure Pressure

The move toward conversational, always-listening systems raises fundamental questions for infrastructure providers and enterprises alike.

Low-latency audio interaction remains technically challenging at scale, especially when inference is handled in the cloud. As a result, analysts expect increased pressure on edge compute, distributed inference architectures, and on-device processing, particularly for robotics, wearables and in-vehicle systems.

Privacy and trust are equally critical. Persistent audio capture heightens concerns around consent, data retention and regulatory exposure, particularly in Europe, where voice data may be classified as sensitive personal information. Successful deployment is likely to depend less on model capability and more on transparent controls over what is recorded, stored, and processed.

Hardware Ambitions, Cautiously Staged

While OpenAI has explored hardware partnerships previously, The Information reported that any audio-first devices were positioned as a longer-term initiative, with internal timelines pointing to 2027 rather than an immediate commercial launch.

The cautious staging reflects lessons from earlier attempts to move beyond screens, where voice-centric products struggled with reliability, context awareness, and user trust. The reported focus suggests OpenAI is prioritising platform readiness and enterprise viability before committing to hardware at scale.

Why It Matters

OpenAI’s audio push is not just a product update; it is a signal of how AI interfaces are evolving as systems move closer to everyday deployment.

For consumer electronics, it points toward more ambient, screen-light interaction. For robotics, it reinforces speech as a control and coordination layer. Finally, for enterprises, it raises new questions about infrastructure design, latency, governance and how AI integrates into daily operations at scale.

Whether audio becomes the dominant interface will depend less on novelty and more on execution. In 2026, conversational AI will be judged not by how natural it sounds, but by how reliably it performs when systems are always on.",https://www.techerati.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Techerati-images-2026-01-07T112135.492.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 10:02:26.918495

Siegler,,,,,https://spyglass.org/microsoft-almost-acquistion-openai/,"I've long thought that the Inflection deal structure, and thus, the ""hackquisition"", was born out of a deal Microsoft nearly had to execute under duress.
Either OpenAI would reinstate Altman, or Microsoft would just hire the entire company.4 Sound familiar?
So yeah, Microsoft would have paid at least $25B, and perhaps $29B to do that would-have-been ""hackquisition"".
The key bit to remember here is that no one actually owned equity in OpenAI at the time.
And it highlights just how killer of a deal Microsoft would have gotten here.","When looking back at the origins of the ""hackquisition"" model for acquiring startups, Microsoft was clearly the godfather of such deals. Their March 2024 deal to not buy Inflection, but instead to bring on much of their team was groundbreaking in this regard, and it has led basically all of their rivals to copy (or expand upon) the same general structure.1 But actually, there was almost a ""hackquisition"" that Microsoft did before the Inflection deal... OpenAI.

I've long thought that the Inflection deal structure, and thus, the ""hackquisition"", was born out of a deal Microsoft nearly had to execute under duress. In November 2023, OpenAI's board ousted CEO Sam Altman and the ensuing weekend saw Microsoft, led by Satya Nadella on down, scramble to save the situation. The company had invested around $13B into OpenAI at the time – a lot of money in those days2 – and they were worried it was going to go to zero overnight.3 So they implemented a plan. Either OpenAI would reinstate Altman, or Microsoft would just hire the entire company.4

Sound familiar?

But wait, don't ""hackquisitions"" also involve some level of IP rights? You know, ""non-exclusive licensing agreements""? For show, if nothing else? Yeah, Microsoft didn't need those here because they already had far more rights to OpenAI's IP, thanks to their deal terms following their massive investments. So yes, this would have been the first ""hackquisition"". And now we know how much it would have cost.

Thanks to text messages from OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap, uncovered as part of Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, to Nadella and Altman, we have the number. $25B. Or $29B if they wanted to include Ilya Sutskever. Which of course Microsoft would have, but given his role in said coup d'état of Altman, it's not clear that would have happened...

As relayed by Rocket Drew of The Information:

Lightcap disclosed Sutskever’s financial stake after the OpenAI board fired CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella prepared to hire Altman and OpenAI colleagues. Lightcap wrote to Altman and Nadella that paying OpenAI employees for their equity would require $25 billion excluding Sutskever’s equity, or $29 billion including Sutskever’s vested units. (It’s not clear how much Sutskever had in unvested equity.)

The day following the exchange, Microsoft chief technology officer Kevin Scott said publicly that Microsoft would hire and match the compensation of every OpenAI employee who chose to resign from the startup, in the event that Altman was not reinstated at OpenAI. Those hires never happened because the OpenAI board rehired Altman later that night.

So yeah, Microsoft would have paid at least $25B, and perhaps $29B to do that would-have-been ""hackquisition"". That's not too surprising since OpenAI was valued at... $29B during secondary sales that were taking place at the time. But the math wouldn't have been quite that straightforward.

The key bit to remember here is that no one actually owned equity in OpenAI at the time. This was long before the conversion to the public benefit corporation, and everyone from Microsoft on down simply had percentages of the rights to future profits. Microsoft was clearly willing to ""true up"" those employees and match the on-paper value, and seemingly assume that those employee shares equated to 100% ownership of the company. Of course, there were other investors in OpenAI, even beyond Microsoft. So the bigger question remains if they would have given those other investors anything.5

That is, of course, another key component to the ""hackquisition"", paying out investors to ensure they go along with the deal. Given how freaked out those investors were during ""The Blip"", it seems reasonable to think they believed they'd be getting nothing for their investments. But it's also probably reasonable to think that Microsoft would have given them something to avoid future litigation, if nothing else. Again, this is what Microsoft did with Inflection investors several months later.

And if that's the case, that probably would have pushed the deal well past $30B – especially if you consider compensation for Altman, who famously had no direct equity – or even ""Profit Participation Units"" – in OpenAI at the time (and apparently still doesn't). But if Sutskever was going to get $4B... Microsoft probably would have wanted to keep Altman happy, in order to keep him.

Anyway, there was one massive shareholder Microsoft didn't need to pay out: Microsoft. Everyone now knows they own 27% of OpenAI, but again, at the time no one had any equity. Microsoft had the right to 49% of those profits (though actually a much higher percentage until their initial investment was paid back) and undoubtedly could have and would have argued that meant they ""owned"" 49% of the company. Unless it was regulators who were asking.

Had anyone else tried to ""hackquire"" – or even actually acquire – OpenAI, they probably would have wanted at least $15B for their troubles, if not more. And it highlights just how killer of a deal Microsoft would have gotten here.

Call it $30B - $35B to effectively buy OpenAI in late 2023. Given that the company is currently raising around an $850B valuation just over two years later...

Alas, by the end of the weekend, Altman was back in place atop OpenAI and ""The Blip"" was just that, a blip. This is clearly the outcome Nadella and Microsoft wanted, undoubtedly due to regulatory concerns if nothing else. But the mad scramble also pretty clearly planted the seed that would grow into the ""hackquisition"" model.",https://spyglass.org/content/images/size/w1200/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-7--2026--11_36_36-AM-1.png,N,,2026-01-07 08:01:14.838056

She highlights the mixed performance of current AI technologies, which succeed brilliantly in some tasks while faltering in others, challenging the notion of a one-size-fits-all human benchmark.

Anthropic President Daniela Amodei has challenged the AI industry's holy grail, suggesting that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—the theoretical point where machines match human-level intelligence—may already be an irrelevant concept. In a recent CNBC interview, Amodei argued that AGI no longer captures how AI systems simultaneously outperform humans in some areas while falling dramatically short in others. ""AGI is such a funny term,"" she said. ""Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?' I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong—or maybe not wrong, but just outdated."" Her comments arrive as tech giants pour tens of billions of dollars into AGI development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims we're ""confident we know how to build AGI"" and predicts powerful AI agents will join the workforce in 2025. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis estimates AGI is five to ten years away, while Anthropic's own CEO Dario Amodei previously suggested it could arrive as early as 2026. Elon Musk predicted his xAI company would achieve AGI by 2026—notably, after predicting it would arrive by 2025 last year.

Amodei pointed to concrete examples where AI has already surpassed human capabilities. Anthropic's Claude model now writes code comparable to many professional engineers inside the company itself. ""That's crazy,"" she said, noting the speed of advancement. In November 2025, Claude Opus 4.5 became the first model to exceed 80% accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark using real GitHub issues that professional developers tackle daily. Yet these same systems still falter at tasks that humans handle with ease. “Claude still can’t do a lot of things that humans can do,” Amodei acknowledged. This tension—superhuman performance in narrow areas alongside conspicuous weaknesses—undermines the idea of a single, universal general intelligence threshold.

The real question isn't when AGI arrives, but how businesses actually use AI

Rather than the milestones of AGI, the urgent question, according to Amodei, is how companies use these tools and the speed at which people can adapt. Even as the models improve, he says, adoption slows due to managing change, buying processes, and the difficulty of spotting where AI really adds value instead of just hype. For Amodei, the future of AI won't depend on whether it fits some textbook definition of AGI. It's going to depend on what these systems can do, where they miss the mark, and how society chooses to use them.

For instance, 71% of respondents said they were worried about how generative AI uses their information.

A quarter of consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025 and a further 31% plan to adopt them in future.

That’s according to a new report from IT firm Capgemini, based on global consumer responses and interviews with retail executives.

“Brands must move beyond being optimised for search to being optimised for selection,” said Dreen Yang, EVP, global consumer products and retail lead at Capgemini. “Success increasingly depends on being chosen by algorithms, not just found by consumers.”

In practice, shoppers can apply AI in different ways, whether they make purchases directly through a chatbot, use algorithms for advice, or allow a virtual assistant to spend money on their behalf.

Last year, for instance, OpenAI announced that it would be allowing US users to purchase Etsy, Shopify, and Walmart goods through ChatGPT.

Other companies, such as Amazon, have proven more hesitant, blocking OpenAI crawlers and thereby restricting access to its product listings. By focusing on its own AI ambitions, Amazon hopes to retain control over the e-commerce advertising market.

According to Capgemini, 63% of surveyed consumers want generative AI to provide hyper-personalised shopping content, although concerns around the technology remain. For instance, 71% of respondents said they were worried about how generative AI uses their information.

The desire for human assistance also remains strong, with 66% of those surveyed valuing human support at the point of purchase. This means brands should offer “a balanced mix of digital convenience and human support,” said Capgemini.

In particular, helpline chatbots on company sites, intended to give instant, 24/7 support, were comparatively unpopular, only satisfying 57% of respondents.

Appealing to the bots

According to the report, retailers must adapt to the new age of shopping or risk being left behind.

To improve traction with AI bots, firms should provide machine-readable, continuously refreshed data, enriched with product attributes. This means that the technology can interpret, surface, and recommend products in real-time.

AI tools are more likely to recommend companies that give detailed context about their goods, as it is easier for the bot to understand who the item is for and why it is relevant.

Third-party sources like reviews and ratings also matter, said Capgemini, as they influence how large language models describe the goods or the brand.

Looking ahead, the continued popularity of chatbot shopping is, however, reliant on a number of factors. One key question revolves around the appetite of AI firms for advertisement. If shopping assistants become densely populated with adverts, it’s possible that consumer trust in their recommendations will decline.

Tapping into the transition

When it comes to a firm’s own AI offerings, it's important to adapt the tech to the consumer’s preferences, said Capgemini.

In other words, brands that stand out are offering diverse shopping experiences through one interface. Some users like to explore on their own, while others prefer step-by-step recommendations, both of which can be accommodated using AI tools. Novel offerings include “try-on” features for clothes or accessories, as well as ‘AI style advisers”.

Transparency and control around this technology is also crucial, said the report. A majority of shoppers want to set strict boundaries on digital assistants such as spending caps, and 63% want to approve or reject purchases initiated by AI.

The investment forms – according to the bank – part of a broader strategy to engage with digital assets and tokenised forms of money. While they haven’t disclosed the size of the stake or the valuation of Ubyx, Barclay’s has stated that this was its first investment in a company focused on stablecoins.

Founded in 2025, Ubyx operates a clearing system designed to support stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are typically pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies. The platform aims to reconcile tokens issued by different stablecoin providers, addressing interoperability challenges as the number of issuers and blockchain networks continues to grow.

Interest in stablecoins and blockchain-based financial infrastructure has seen something of a renewal over the past year, with banks and financial institutions announcing a range of initiatives tied to digital assets.

This renewed momentum has been driven in part by rising cryptocurrency prices and renewed political attention in the United States, including support for the sector from President Donald Trump, which has contributed to increased market volatility and speculation.

Despite this renewed interest across the sector, many blockchain-related projects across the banking industry remain at an early stage of development.

Alongside Barclays, Ubyx has previously attracted investment from the venture capital arms of US crypto firms Coinbase and Galaxy Digital, according to PitchBook.

The stablecoin market itself has expanded rapidly, with the number of tokens in circulation rising sharply in recent years. El Salvador-based Tether currently leads the market, with $187 billion worth of tokens outstanding. Stablecoins are primarily used to move funds within cryptocurrency markets, though proponents argue their role could expand into mainstream financial services.

Barclays said the investment aligns with growing interest in tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins, particularly as regulatory frameworks begin to take shape in several jurisdictions. The bank described Ubyx as a clearing system for digital money, including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins.

“Interoperability is essential to unlock the full potential of digital assets,” said Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays.

The analysis piece - by Jim Burkhard, Vice President and Global Head of Crude Oil Research, and the S&P Global Energy Crude Oil Markets team - outlined that S&P Global Energy is still projecting a 1.4 million barrel per day global crude oil stock build in the first quarter of this year.
“However, there could be a more discernible impact on the heavy sour crude oil market,” the analysis piece stated.

The analysis piece - by Jim Burkhard, Vice President and Global Head of Crude Oil Research, and the S&P Global Energy Crude Oil Markets team - outlined that S&P Global Energy is still projecting a 1.4 million barrel per day global crude oil stock build in the first quarter of this year. The analysis also outlined that S&P Global Energy is still calling for Dated Brent to average $60 per barrel.

“However, there could be a more discernible impact on the heavy sour crude oil market,” the analysis piece stated.

“Venezuela accounts for one percent of global crude oil production but roughly nine percent of the world’s nine million barrels per day of heavy crude oil production. The United States and China are the world’s largest markets for heavy crude oil,” it added.

“Global heavy crude/heavy residual feedstock markets are currently narrowly balanced. Higher supply would be bearish for heavy sour crude differentials and high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) cracks. Lower supply would be modestly bullish,” it continued.

The analysis piece stated that, in 2025, Venezuela produced an average of 826,000 barrels per day of crude oil, excluding imported diluent that is blended into domestic production. Crude oil exports, including blended diluent, averaged 750,000 barrels per day, according to the analysis.

“Before Jan. 3, S&P Global Energy had already assumed a reduction in supply from Venezuela due to U.S. efforts to curtail exports on sanctioned oil tankers, and the view remains the same,” the analysis noted.

“While S&P Global Energy sees risk to the upside and downside in terms of production and exports, it is not enough either way to significantly alter the global oil balance in the first quarter,” it added.

“If sanctions were removed, Venezuelan oil production could grow but it would require at least several billion dollars or more of fresh investment to boost marketed production to 1.5 million barrels per day in the next 12-24 months - an increase of roughly 500,000 barrels per day from recent levels (including blended diluent),” it continued.

In the analysis piece, Burkhard stated that recent developments in Venezuela do little to alter the fact that the global oil market is facing a surplus at the start of 2026.

In a statement sent to Rigzone by the Morningstar team late Monday, which focused on the Venezuela situation, Morningstar’s director of equity research, Joshua Aguilar, said, “we don’t plan to alter our fair value estimates or our midcycle oil price estimates of Brent $65 per barrel and WTI $60 per barrel”.

“While significant Venezuelan supply increases to global markets could be bearish for our 10-year forecast, we think it will take years for supply to meaningfully increase,” he added.

“Venezuela will require years of large capital investments to modernize its infrastructure,” he continued.

In a comment sent to Rigzone early Tuesday, Aaron Hill, Chief Market Analyst at FP Markets, noted that the “Venezuela crisis trigger[ed]… [a] rally in commodities”.

“Crude markets … found support, with WTI rallying nearly 2.0 percent as the intervention cast fresh uncertainty over access to oil reserves,” Hill said.

In a statement sent to Rigzone on Monday morning, Naeem Assam, Chief Analyst at Zaye Capital Markets, noted that “oil remains range bound, with Brent near $60.9 per barrel and WTI around $57.4 per barrel, underscoring that macroeconomic weakness is outweighing geopolitical risk”.

“Despite U.S. actions tied to Venezuela and rhetoric from Donald Trump regarding control of Venezuelan oil assets under Nicolas Maduro, price reaction has been muted - clear evidence of headline exhaustion,” he added.

In a news conference held on January 3 in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, which was streamed by Sky News, U.S. President Donald Trump stated, “late last night and early today, at my direction, the United States Armed Forces conducted an extraordinary military operation in the capital of Venezuela”.",https://images.rigzone.com/images/rz-facebook.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 07:01:28.113876

The ability to use 45-degrees Celsius water means no chillers are needed

That has implications for energy efficiency and the broader cooling market

When you think of liquid cooling for data centers, you probably don't think of hot water. But that’s exactly what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it can use to cool its new Vera Rubin supercomputers.

Contrary to what you might think (again), this could be good news for liquid cooling companies, despite the stock market's reaction to the news today. But first, here is the break-down of the news and what it means.

“The power of Vera Rubin is twice as high as Grace Blackwell. And yet – and this is the miracle – the air that goes into it, the air flow is about the same. And very importantly, the water that goes into it is the same temperature, 45 degrees C,” Huang said on the CES keynote stage on Monday. “With 45 degrees C, no water chillers are necessary for data centers. We are basically cooling this supercomputer with hot water.”

In case it’s not immediately apparent, this is a big change: 45-degrees Celsius is around 113-degrees Fahrenheit.

There are two big takeaways from this shift: one, it could be very good news for liquid cooling, and two, it could be good news for energy efficiency.

Good news for energy efficiency

Taking the latter point first, the ability to use high-temperature water eliminates the need for chillers and their power-hungry compressors. This, in turn, enables a shift to dry cooler systems.

Without nerding out too much, dry cooler systems can use ambient air – which in many places is under 45-degrees Celsius for many parts of the year – to cool the liquid running through the cooling system rather than a chiller.

Huang said in his CES address that the shift “enables us to save about 6% of the world's data center power.” That’s a huge deal in a market where access to power is a key constraint and consumption is a point of public criticism.

Good news for liquid cooling, too

But circling back to the first takeaway, the shift could also be good news for liquid cooling systems in general.

Dell’Oro Group noted in December that direct liquid cooling – the leading option for cooling high-performance computing – grew 85% in Q3 2025 and was on track to surpass $2 billion in yearly revenue.

“Liquid cooling has always had the opportunity to work at higher temperatures, like at 45-degrees Celsius, to cool these AI workloads,” Lucas Beran, Director of Product Marketing at Accelsius, told Fierce. “This cements the value that liquid cooling is bringing to the data center. You could not use 45-Celsius air to cool these processors.”

Beran added the change could especially be a boon for two-phase direct liquid cooling, which he said functions more efficiently at higher temperatures.

The dominant liquid cooling systems today are single phase, meaning the cooling liquid stays a liquid. Two-phase systems include a change from liquid to gas and back again. In October, Accelsius CEO Josh Claman told Fierce he believed two-phase cooling had reached a “tipping point” but noted some supply chain issues were slowing uptake of the technology.

“This starts to open the door for two-phase cooling’s better performance at higher facility water temperatures to resonate,” Beran said.

The looming question, of course, is what this means for the rest of the multi-billion-dollar data center cooling market. It doesn’t seem to bode well for vendors of traditional chiller and HVAC systems.

“If being able to support Vera Rubin chips with 45-degree Celsius water means you don’t need a chiller, then instead of buying a chiller you’re going to buy a dry cooler, which probably isn’t going to come from your traditional [heat] rejection supplier,” Beran said.

And the stock market reaction

Despite Beran's positive angle on the news, investors took it as a bad sign. Stocks for traditional cooling players Vertiv, Schneider Electric, Johnson Controls and Eaton all took a sharp dive when the markets opened after Huang’s address. All but Johnson Controls had recovered a few hours later. Vertiv, Schneider and Johnson all make chillers for data center applications.

Fierce reached out to Schneider and Vertiv for comment and will update this story when we hear back.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud4/media/image/liquid%20cooling%20silicon%20gpu_MJ%20for%20FN.png?VersionId=mwYyzRTGCJwBTaO6fzQPfcIs4pXxnWtF,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:57.906123

And its commanding EBIT of 16.0 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. It is well worth noting that Boston Scientific's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 31% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Boston Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.

Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Boston Scientific recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 87% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.

Our View

Boston Scientific's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like Boston Scientific commonly do use debt without problems. Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Boston Scientific is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Boston Scientific .

By Alexander Jones, International Banker

The consensus among analysts is that broad stability will characterise the global banking sector in 2026. That said, the key industry risks that periodically cropped up during 2025 have the potential to return during the coming year. While credit-rating firms are largely “neutral” on the sector for the time being, with most core financial metrics unlikely to be spectacularly impacted, they remain watchful for specific trends that could trigger a more pronounced downside scenario.

According to S&P Global Ratings, four key risks will influence bank ratings in 2026:

An escalation of geopolitical risks, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East;

A stronger spillover from tariff shocks to the real economy and financial markets than initially anticipated;

A weakening of banks’ regulatory environments; and

Evolving risks, including climate change and new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).

As the global economy demonstrated throughout 2025, heightened geopolitical risks remain inescapable. Some regions are now gearing up to ensure their banking sectors can withstand potential adverse shocks from escalating conflicts, with Europe likely to do the most in 2026 to counter any destabilising effects.

A report published in October by the European Parliament—“The Impact of Geopolitical Risks on the Resilience of Banks in the Banking Union”—spelled out only too clearly how seriously elevated geopolitical risks could rock the banking sector’s stability. According to the report, empirical research indicated that associated spikes in geopolitical-risk indices coincided with potentially sizeable drops in bank profitability (especially for smaller and weakly capitalised banks) and asset quality (particularly for smaller banks), as well as with increases in banks’ perceived risks, as measured by the credit-derivatives market.

From a supervisory perspective, the report also found that geopolitical risks were reinforced by certain weaknesses in the management of cybersecurity risks, a finding that was generated by an ad hoc stress test of the cyber-resilience of major banks. “Although recovery plans were present in all surveyed banks, many institutions did not have in place specific tools for managing complex scenarios and preserving customer data and assets,” the research added.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has urged Europe’s banking sector to accept a new reality with more frequent shocks, including tariffs and cyberattacks, and to remain prepared for a range of possibilities, even when the exact nature of the next crisis is unknown. “Geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies, climate and nature-related crises, demographic change and technological disruptions are exacerbating structural vulnerabilities, making the likelihood of extreme, low-probability events unprecedentedly high,” Europe’s top monetary institution explained in a November statement. It also confirmed that strengthening banks’ resilience to political risks and uncertainties will remain the ECB’s top supervisory priority, with a focus on prudent risk-taking and adequate capitalisation.

On the tariff front, meanwhile, banks worldwide will likely remain wary of extending credit to certain industries and businesses, particularly those reliant on global supply chains. With margins being squeezed and the risks of corporate-loan defaults and higher capital requirements elevated, banks in 2026 will want to ensure they lend only to companies with sufficiently contained credit-risk profiles.

Some analysts have pointed to Europe as the region with the highest banking-sector vulnerability to trade wars. Citing various studies on the subject, BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria) found in August that European banking systems are both the “most” and “least” exposed to the trade war. “Italy is considered the most exposed via the Bank of Italy due to its exports to the United States and the composition of its credit portfolio, more concentrated in sectors affected by tariffs,” according to the Spanish bank. “Germany, Ireland and Slovenia have also been identified as vulnerable. Moody’s agrees in identifying Ireland, Germany and Italy as the most exposed, also suggesting that the banking systems of Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom could see their net interest margins (NIM) reduced due to the high proportion of variable-rate mortgages.”

Regarding the regulatory environment in 2026, analysts have stated that they expect a possible easing of certain rules for banks. Fitch Ratings, for example, projected an overall “looser” outlook for bank regulation as deregulation rises, with the United States and the United Kingdom leading the way—and to a lesser extent, the European Union (EU). Emerging markets, meanwhile, will see “tighter standards” to reduce banking-sector vulnerabilities and attract foreign investment.

“Key areas to watch for 2026 are the implementation of Basel III endgame rules in the US, amendments to resolution regimes, including depositor preference and capital stack, and digital asset innovation and the increasing scrutiny of private credit markets,” Fitch noted in its “Global Banking Regulation Outlook 2026” report. “We expect macroprudential policies to vary across regions, with a looser stance in low-growth developed markets and a tighter approach in high-growth, high-inflation emerging markets.”

While the major credit-rating firms have been clear about the key risks to global banking that may emerge in 2026, their overall outlooks have nonetheless suggested a largely moderate, stable environment for global lenders. For example, despite persistent challenges such as geopolitical tensions and high trade barriers, Moody’s 2026 outlook highlighted broad stability across the sector, with strong bank creditworthiness supported by resilient asset quality, solid funding profiles and sustained profitability.

This is largely owing to a resilient, albeit slowing, US economy, while several of the largest European countries may even see their real GDP (gross domestic product) gradually increase from modest levels. In emerging markets, Moody’s has highlighted rapid GDP growth across several key regions, particularly India, the fastest-growing economy in the G20 (Group of Twenty).

“Broadly stable employment levels and lower interest rates will support credit quality, although central bank monetary policies are diverging,” according to the rating firm’s global co-head of banking, Donald Robertson. “Net interest margins will likely be squeezed by lower rates in some regions, but banks will mitigate this by growing other sources of income. And healthy capital and reserve levels will continue to support both credit growth and shareholder distributions. However, the prospect of a looser regulatory environment adds some incremental risk for bank creditors.”

Similarly, S&P Global Ratings has forecast broad rating stability for global banks in 2026, with 85 percent of its ratings currently assigned a “stable” outlook. “Banks’ balance sheets are solid, characterized by good capitalization, sound asset quality, and adequate funding and liquidity,” an S&P report published on December 9 acknowledged. “That said, banks are operating at a volatile time, when significant policy decisions and regional conflicts could disrupt financial markets and rapidly change the economic environment.”

Moody’s also observed that banks will continue to invest in their businesses in response to the rapid development of private credit markets, artificial intelligence and digital assets, all of which will reshape the sector for many years to come. “Beyond macro and regulatory drivers, structural change is accelerating. AI is being deployed across risk management, compliance, customer service and product design, improving efficiency but also introducing new operational and cyber risks,” Moody’s “Outlooks 2026: Global Banks” explained.

“Private credit is expanding its role as an alternative source of finance for corporates, increasing competitive pressure on banks in some segments,” the outlook also noted. “At the same time, digital assets and tokenized financial instruments are prompting banks to adapt their technology stacks and risk frameworks.”

Could private credit pose a major risk to the banking sector this year? Not according to S&P Global Ratings’ managing director of financial institutions ratings, Brendan Browne. “Such lending requires strong surveillance, a thorough understanding of collateral, and safeguards to ensure that such collateral is not being double-counted, that is, pledged elsewhere,” Browne recently explained. “That said, we don’t see this as a material systemic risk that could cause major widespread problems for banks. However, NBFI [non-bank financial institution] lending is likely to continue growing at a robust pace. Furthermore, for some banks, NBFI lending as a proportion of total lending has grown well into the low double digits and sometimes into the mid-teens or higher.”

Fitch Ratings, however, has specifically cited the rising exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which now account for nearly 10 percent of bank loans, as a key risk to the banking sector, with US lenders particularly exposed. “While private credit offers opportunities, its complexity and opacity raise concerns about performance under stress,” according to Fitch’s November 21 outlook for US banks. “Consumer credit risk is increasing, particularly among lower-income borrowers facing high interest rates, eroding savings, and rising unemployment (forecast at 4.7 percent).”",https://internationalbanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Global-Banking.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 07:01:33.670077

The new mirror analyzes real-time skin-aging signals to predict aging and delivers personalized solutions tailored to individual needs, including product recommendations, according to the company.
“Amorepacific aims to lead the global beauty and wellness industry with holistic longevity solutions,” Hyojung Joo, head of Amorepacific’s digital strategy division, said in a statement.
L’Oréal Groupe is also betting big on new tech with its foray into LED light therapy.
“It’s the thinnest LED mask in the world, at one millimeter thick,” Guive Balooch, global vp of tech and open innovation at L’Oreal Groupe, told Glossy.","The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas kicked off on Tuesday, and videos of viral new tech are already flooding social media. This includes an AI-powered robot that folds laundry, smart Legos that change color and an electric spoon that makes food taste salty without using actual sodium.

On the wellness front, bionic footwear gained momentum — it’s a technology that Nike is developing, as well, and is often described as “an e-bike for walking.” As expected, health tracking is also trending, seen in a body-scanning smart scale from Withings, a new tracker watch competitor to Whoop from the brand Luna, and a $899 Longevity Mirror from Nuralogix that tracks blood flow to the face to rate the user’s longevity.

But it was Amorepacific, parent company of brands like Laneige, Etude and Sulwhasoo, that received a CES Innovation Honoree Award — for Skinsight, a new smart mirror developed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Samsung Electronics. The new mirror analyzes real-time skin-aging signals to predict aging and delivers personalized solutions tailored to individual needs, including product recommendations, according to the company.

“Amorepacific aims to lead the global beauty and wellness industry with holistic longevity solutions,” Hyojung Joo, head of Amorepacific’s digital strategy division, said in a statement. The company did not share when the product will be available for sale.

L’Oréal Groupe is also betting big on new tech with its foray into LED light therapy. The company revealed an ultra-thin, flexible silicone mask on Tuesday, as well as eye patches. “It’s the thinnest LED mask in the world, at one millimeter thick,” Guive Balooch, global vp of tech and open innovation at L’Oreal Groupe, told Glossy. “It’s super, super easy to apply, it’s flexible, and we have [eye patch and] full-face versions, which is really cool.”

Both of the prototypes were made with U.K.-based I-Smart Developments, a global leader in LED device innovation and maker of LED masks from Omnilux, Beauty Pie and The Light Salon. Balooch believes that the large, plastic, helmet-like masks available from top brands will slowly lose their luster among consumers as thin, lightweight alternatives emerge. “[I-Smart Developments] found a way to make flexible electronics at the power [that is proven to be effective when] put into a mask,” he said. “It almost feels like a sheet mask.”

I-Smart Developments has completed more than 10 clinical tests on its LED lights, including four on L’Oréal’s new prototypes, which are shown to combat fine lines, sagging and uneven tone when used 10 minutes per day, Balooch said. L’Oréal Group is currently seeking FDA approval for both versions. If successful, Balooch will focus on developing chest, neck, forehead and chin versions. The exact price of the mask has not been determined, but it will launch at “a few hundred dollars,” to start, Balooch said. He hopes to rapidly scale manufacturing to lower the price for the mass market.

According to Mintel market research company, just 10% of U.S. consumers reported using an LED light therapy mask in 2025, up from 5% in 2023. However, Mintel found that these numbers soar when looking at interest among teenagers: 33% of U.S. consumers ages 12-17 reported using facial skin-care devices, like red-light masks or cleansing devices, within the past year.

Balooch told Glossy that L’Oréal Group will determine the right brand for the mask soon. He mentioned Lancôme, Armani, Prada and YSL as potential fits for the tech, which will launch in 2027.

“Longevity is a broad word, but for us, it’s about trying to, as much as possible, get our biology to be as young as possible — not just our chronological age, but also our biological age,” he said. “It’s a very exciting moment, because the tech is also evolving and allowing us to do it.”

Executive moves:

Esi Eggleston Bracey is stepping down from her role as chief growth and marketing officer at Unilever after an eight-year tenure at the conglomerate. Leandro Barreto, former CMO for Unilever’s beauty and wellbeing arm, will replace Bracey.

News to know:

TrueMed, an HSA- and FSA-focused online retailer, has taken on $34 million in Series A funding led by capital market firm Andreessen Horowitz. As previously reported by Glossy, pre-tax flexible-spending and health-spending accounts have grown in popularity as the “health is wealth” movement continues. As of January 2024, there was more than $1 billion in HSA and FSA accounts ready to be spent.

A new Gallup poll shows that more than half of Americans surveyed are interested in losing weight. The group found that 41% of Americans surveyed describe themselves as being overweight, and 26% are actively trying to lose weight. Broken out by gender, women are more likely to want to lose weight and more likely to attempt to lose weight. By age, around 30% of 18- to 34-year-old adults say they are overweight, compared with 44% of 35- to 54-year-olds, and 45% of adults aged 55 and older.

Healf, the U.K.-based wellness retailer, has hired A-list faces to front its resolution-focused marketing campaign starring supermodel Claudia Schiffer, DJ Calvin Harris and Olympian Miles Chamley-Watson. Schiffer is also an investor in the company, which took on an undisclosed investment from Iris Ventures in 2025.

The FDA approved the first oral GLP-1 on December 22. Currently called the “Wegovy pill,” it was developed by Danish pharma company Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and could be available early this year, according to Reuters.

After a turbulent start to the year driven by critical analyst commentary, Adobe's stock has shown signs of stabilization mid-week. The core of investor skepticism revolves around artificial intelligence, with growing doubts about whether the software giant's AI models can translate into measurable revenue quickly enough. Market observers view the current price action as a tentative attempt to form a base in a jittery trading environment.

The recent weakness was triggered by a downgrade from the research firm Jefferies on Monday. Analysts removed their ""Buy"" recommendation, shifting the rating to ""Hold,"" and slashed their price target dramatically from $500 to $400. Their rationale carries significant weight: the anticipated revenue boost from generative AI, spearheaded by Adobe's Firefly models, has been slower to materialize than expected. According to Jefferies, the aggressive AI strategy for fiscal 2026 has not yet been monetized to the degree the market had priced in.

This assessment prompted further adjustments. BMO Capital Markets also reduced its price target to $400, although it maintained its ""Outperform"" rating. This follows earlier caution from KeyBanc in mid-December, which warned of stagnating growth projections for recurring revenue.

The Demand for Tangible Results

The landscape for software equities has shifted. Whereas 2025 was heavily influenced by hype surrounding technological potential, investors in 2026 are demanding concrete results on the balance sheet. Jefferies analysts noted that adoption of Adobe's tools by casual users is progressing more slowly than hoped, partly due to a flood of cheaper AI alternatives.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

Even Adobe's current presence at CES 2026 and the release of its ""Creative Trends Report"" have so far failed to sustainably improve market sentiment. Wall Street is now strictly focused on financial metrics rather than thematic trends, a pattern evident across the broader sector where competitors like Salesforce have also seen a weak start to the year.

Technical Perspective and Future Catalysts

Closing at $335.46 on Tuesday, the stock is now testing a crucial support level around $330. A sustained break below this zone could open the door to further downside, potentially toward the psychologically important $300 mark. On the upside, bulls would need to reclaim the $350 level to improve the technical picture.

For a fundamental reversal in trend, Adobe must deliver operationally in the coming months. Meeting its first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) forecast of $5.85 to $5.90, alongside demonstrating an acceleration in recurring revenue from AI products, will be critical to restoring investor confidence.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2425134_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:15:33.817895

You can build astonishingly complex apps without looking at a single line of code,"" Shipper writes on the Every blog.","The big picture: A mass market, easy-to-use coding tool is a game changer for the 99% of people who, until now, had to rely on other people's software to do anything from building custom data tools to automating repetitive work to building apps or websites.

And Claude Code — Anthropic's AI coding agent powered by models like Claude Opus 4.5 — is having a moment.

Zoom in: Professionals and dabblers alike say Claude's latest tool is best for coding and outperforms others like Cursor, GitHub Copilot and even Gemini 3 Pro.

The tool can read an entire codebase, plan complex changes, write and debug code autonomously, run commands and loop for hours on tasks.

Catch up quick: The term vibe coding — describing projects in natural language instead of code — was coined early last year, but most vibe coding tools still required some coding.

Even as recently as early summer 2025, users still had to understand what a tool was doing in order to use it, Dan Shipper, co-founder and CEO of AI subscription service Every, tells Axios.

""You still really had to understand the underlying architecture, and maybe you still needed to go look at the code,"" Shipper says. ""It would get lost or go off the rails.""

Claude Code changed this by letting users talk directly to an agent and giving Claude full read/write access to files. ""You just tell it to do something, and it works,"" Shipper says, calling it an ""infinite vibe coding machine.""

State of play: The explosion of online excitement about the tool isn't about one dramatic breakthrough, but a result of different factors coalescing.

""The underlying models keep getting better,"" former OpenAI board member Helen Toner tells Axios. ""It's not that it's a huge change, but it's a noticeable improvement.""

Another feature working in its favor: Claude Code runs in the terminal, where programmers actually work.

But Toner thinks the real catalyst was the winter holiday that gave people the extra hours to set up Claude and experiment with it.

Claude Code might be the latest darling, but some say OpenAI's models have also recently reached a kind of escape velocity.

""It genuinely feels to me like GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 in November represent an inflection point — one of those moments where the models get incrementally better in a way that tips across an invisible capability line,"" developer Simon Willison wrote in his blog late last year.

""We are in a new era of autonomous coding. You can build astonishingly complex apps without looking at a single line of code,"" Shipper writes on the Every blog.

Zoom out: Improved vibe coding has the ability to change who gets to make things and whether or not you even need to program.

""It's also a tremendous change in developer productivity, because once you're at that level, you're not just typing in a command and telling the agent to do something, and then just waiting. You're active.""

Shipper says this can give one engineer the productivity of four or five.

Yes, but: There's a big difference between being able to generate a working prototype via vibe coding and being able to create and iterate secure, enterprise-ready applications.

Recognising that many fitness pledges drop by the end of January, the brand is turning a standard retail policy into a powerful tool to encourage active habit building, fun, and long-term commitment to movement throughout the year.

While 48% of Canadians prioritise fitness as their top New Year’s resolution, recent data from Drive Research (2024) reveals a stark tension: roughly 92% fail to see their resolutions through, with the second Friday of January infamously coined the 'Quitters Day.'

In response, Decathlon and creative agency Rethink are intervening at a pivotal moment, turning a simple purchase into a powerful act of self-commitment: Between January 1st and 31st, 2026, customers purchasing the KIPRUN 500 WR models are symbolically waiving their right to return the product, effectively 'locking in' their resolution. Members who stick to their resolution will be rewarded with 1,000 bonus loyalty points in recognition of their commitment to movement.

""We often talk about removing friction from the customer journey, yet here, we’re using friction as a strategic tool for motivation,"" said Xavier Blais, partner and executive creative director at Rethink. ""By challenging the standard return policy, we’re leaning into a fundamental brand truth: Decathlon deeply cares about its customers staying active. It’s a bold move for a retailer to suggest a product is unreturnable, but we’re flipping the script to show how this supports people’s goals: It transforms the brand from a vendor into an accountability partner.""

How does it work?

Everyone interested in starting their year in movement is encouraged to secure their own pair of the unreturnable shoe by following these easy steps:

See our latest analysis for Delta Air Lines.

Delta Air Lines shares have gained momentum in recent months, with a 90 day share price return of 26.44% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 19.46%. The 5 year total shareholder return of 84.21% points to strong long term compounding.

If this kind of recovery story has your attention, it could be a good moment to scan other aerospace and defense stocks that might fit your watchlist next.

With Delta trading at US$72.22, carrying an intrinsic value estimate that implies around a 49% discount and sitting only slightly below the average analyst target, you have to ask: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 3.2% Undervalued

With the most followed fair value sitting at about US$74.61 against the last close of US$72.22, the narrative is only slightly ahead of the market and leans on a detailed multi year earnings path.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $67.81 for Delta Air Lines based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $90.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $59.0.

Read the complete narrative.

Want to see how modest revenue growth, slightly shifting margins and a higher future earnings multiple all fit together? The narrative ties these moving parts into one valuation story that might surprise you.

Result: Fair Value of $74.61 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, this story could look very different if economic growth stalls and corporate or main cabin demand softens, or if low cost rivals increase pricing and capacity pressure.

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our Senior AI Editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Boston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage. Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

Razer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

With the feature called Spatial Aware, you use your smartphone camera to take pictures of a room decorated with Hue lights. The software identifies the light points and considers their location when distributing the color nuances of a color combination selected in the Hue app to the light points. Previously, the algorithms ignored whether the light points were adjacent or far apart – as is common with apps from lighting providers.

Because the Hue software will consider spatial proximity in the future, lighting moods that imitate natural scenarios should appear more realistic. In a sunset scene, the lights on one side of the room would emit warm yellow tones to imitate the setting sun, while the ceiling lights on the opposite side would display darker color tones.

The function is scheduled to be available as a free update “from spring 2026” and will then be compatible with about half of the light scenes pre-installed in the app. Spatial Aware can then be activated via the light scene library.

HomeKit for cameras, AI for Automations

In addition to the new lighting concept feature, Philips Hue announces the long-awaited interface to Apple Home for the brand's security cameras in Las Vegas. The wired Hue Secure Camera, the Hue Secure Video Doorbell, and the Hue Secure Contact Sensors are to receive access to the Apple world by March 2026. From then on, live videos can be streamed via the picture-in-picture mode of the Apple TV set-top box, and push notifications from the Hue Secure system can be received in Apple's Home app. Philips Hue left open whether the cameras will then also support HomeKit Secure Video. The integration enables video storage in Apple's iCloud and location-based automations for camera recording. Previously, Hue lamps with Matter could be integrated directly into Apple Home, but not all of them.

The AI assistant, which has been announced repeatedly for a long time, is now finally to be launched in German. Philips mentioned the first quarter of 2026 as the timeframe. As soon as the AI assistance is available, it will enable rule-based creation of automations via voice input, contrary to what was previously known.

SpatialAware scenes take into account the position of all of the Hue lights in a room, using an algorithm to distribute light in a more natural way.

The savannah sunset scene with SpatialAware

The SpatialAware feature analyzes the layout of each room in the home with Hue lights, and then lighting scenes are tailored to your personal space. Lighting is meant to feel more immersive and dynamic than before.

The savannah sunset scene without SpatialAware

Right now, when a Scene Gallery scene is activated, the different colors are randomly sent to different lights without the system knowing where those lights are positioned. SpatialAware allows color to be distributed more intentionally for a more natural look. A scene that's designed to mimic a sunset, for example, will set lamps on one side of the room to warm yellow tones to mimic the setting sun, while lamps on the other side are set to darker shades.

SpatialAware requires the Hue Bridge Pro that came out last year, and it uses an iPhone or iPad camera to scan the room to figure out where each light is located. Scans can be updated with each new light that's added. SpatialAware will be accessible through the Scene Gallery, and it is an optional setting.

At launch, SpatialAware will be compatible with around half of the light scenes available in the Scene Gallery, and it has been designed primarily for nature-based scenes like lake mist, mountain breeze, and savanna sunset.

Along with SpatialAware, Signify is adding support for migrating multiple Hue bridges to a single Bridge Pro during the Bridge Pro setup process, and it is bringing Apple Home support to the Hue Secure camera line.

The Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell, and Hue contact sensors will work with Apple Home in the future, and users will be able to stream live video in picture-in-picture mode on the Apple TV and get real-time alerts using the Apple Home app.

The Hue AI assistant has been updated with the ability to create automations based on natural language user requests, such as ""wake me up at 6:45 a.m. every day except on Saturdays,"" and AI support is expanding to additional languages like Dutch, German, and Spanish.

Automations for lights and accessories are also now listed in the Rooms and Zones they control for easier adjustment, with options to rearrange content to put the most used automations front and center.

The new Hue SpatialAware feature is launching in spring 2026, while Apple Home support is coming in the first quarter of 2026. Multi-bridge migration and AI assistant automations are available now.",https://images.macrumors.com/t/0ytF2yHrAHCtRUNvDmDy-hHOty0=/1920x/article-new/2026/01/hue-spatialaware-savannah-sunset.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:48.966406

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Ministry of Justice will respond in due course.","The Ministry of Justice should consider changing its name to the “Ministry of Justice (for Certain People)” if it refuses to “wake up” on the subject of legal aid, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee suggests in comments published this morning.

Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative MP since 1992, said the so-called LASPO reforms to legal aid introduced in 2013 “are now at serious risk of going down in history as an extinction event for the entitlement to access to legal advice in large parts of the country”.

Dartmoor

In a report published this morning, the public accounts committee finds that the prison service, a Ministry of Justice executive agency, is spending around £4 million a year of taxpayers’ money on keeping Dartmoor prison in Devon empty because of its failure to negotiate a good deal for the lease. The prison, in use for more than 200 years, has high levels of radon gas.

Clifton-Brown said:

The issue of HMP Dartmoor is an absolute disgrace, from top to bottom.

We heard claims that the leasing of this unusable building, known for years by HM Prison and Probation Service to be choked with radon gas with all the health risks that entailed, was sensible, driven by the need for prison places. Our committee rejects this excuse outright.

Dartmoor appears to the committee a perfect example of a department reaching for a solution, any solution, in a blind panic and under pressure. This is obviously not how policy should be delivered.

Government must now respond to us on what it has learned from this catastrophic failure, and how nothing like it will ever be allowed to happen again.

Today’s report says that levels of radon in 2020 were nearly 10 times the acceptable limit in the prison kitchen. Despite that, the prison service signed a new lease in 2022.

The report says:

HMPPS acknowledged that it would have been helpful to have more information on the density of radon at the Dartmoor site prior to the lease negotiations.

However, it bizarrely maintained that signing the lease without undertaking a recent survey was sensible, given the prison capacity crisis at the time.

It argued that in the context of needing to spend over £600 per cell per night to temporarily hold prisoners in police cells under Operation Safeguard, £1.5 million a year for 640 prison places felt like good value for money…

Under the terms agreed, HMPPS cannot terminate the new lease until after December 2033.

Legal aid

A previous report by the public accounts committee in May 2024 had raised concerns about access to publicly-funded legal advice in areas of the country lacking face-to-face provision of legal aid.

The committee stressed that so-called legal aid deserts, large geographic areas without legal aid providers, risked disproportionately penalising groups who could access remote advice, such as people with disabilities or those with limited access to technology.

In today’s report, the committee says:

For a decade, this committee and its predecessors have urged the Ministry of Justice to get a better understanding of the wider costs of its legal aid reforms. A 2015 report noted the lack of analysis the Ministry of Justice had undertaken of the wider impacts of the reforms on itself and other government departments and stressed that it needed to do more.

In its 2024 report, the previous committee noted that while the Ministry of Justice acknowledged that the removal of most early legal advice via its reforms was likely to have led to additional costs to the public sector, its progress in measuring the scale of these costs was disappointing.

The Ministry of Justice and the Legal Aid Agency acknowledged that a cyberattack on the agency’s online digital services had begun in December 2024, four months before it was detected on 23 April 2025. It took action in April to boost security, informing legal aid providers that their bank details might have been compromised. However, the agency did not discover the full extent of the attack until 16 May 2025, at which point it took its systems offline

The risk of a cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency’s systems had been rated as “extremely high” since 2021, it added.

Responses

Welcoming today’s report, solicitors’ representatives said that nearly 70% of the population were denied access to a community care legal aid provider in their area.

The Law Society said it had “long warned about the Legal Aid Agency’s antiquated computer systems”.

Their fragility had prevented vital reforms, including updates to the means test that could help millions more access legal aid. It called on the Ministry of Justice to publish a timetable for implementing all the means test changes.

The Ministry of Justice will respond in due course.

Cairo-based Bank NXT has partnered with IBM and Inspire for Solutions Development to modernise its technology stack as part of a broader push toward scalable, cloud-native digital banking.

Under the collaboration, Bank NXT has implemented IBM Instana, IBM Turbonomic, and IBM Cloud Pak solutions to strengthen real-time observability, automate resource optimisation, and improve system integration across its digital banking environment. The initiative aims to enhance platform resilience, minimise downtime, and expedite the delivery of digital services as Egypt’s banking sector advances toward more agile, technology-driven models.

Egyptian banks are increasingly under pressure to modernise legacy systems to support always-on digital channels, open banking connectivity, and collaboration with FinTech partners. Bank NXT’s technology upgrade reflects a wider industry trend toward cloud-native architectures and DevOps-driven operating models that can support rapid innovation while maintaining operational stability.

As part of the transformation, Bank NXT deployed IBM Instana to gain real-time visibility across its digital banking applications, enabling proactive monitoring and quicker issue resolution. IBM Turbonomic has been introduced to automate intelligent resource allocation across hybrid cloud environments, helping optimise IT utilisation and control infrastructure costs as transaction volumes scale.

The bank has also adopted IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, running on Red Hat OpenShift, to consolidate systems and simplify application development and deployment. According to the bank, this has reduced platform complexity and supported a continuous delivery model for new digital services.

“Our collaboration with IBM and Inspire for Solutions Development is a crucial part of the bank’s transformation strategy,” said Tamer Seif, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Bank NXT. “By adopting the DevOps model and improving our business automation capabilities, we have enhanced the flexibility of our technology infrastructure. This prepares us to integrate with FinTech companies through an API-driven ecosystem and deliver faster, more responsive services.”

Alongside technology deployment, Bank NXT is investing in workforce upskilling through training programmes focused on observability, automation, integration, and DevOps practices. The bank said this is intended to ensure long-term sustainability of its digital platform and support the continued rollout of new digital banking services across retail and corporate segments.",https://ibsintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/banknxteg_logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:14:00.263858

Several European lenders have already begun restructuring with artificial intelligence at the core of their cost-cutting strategies.
In November, Dutch lender ABN Amro announced plans to reduce around one-fifth of its full-time workforce by 2028, according to the Economic Times.
'Otherwise, we're storing up a big problem for the future,' Hillery cautioned, according to the Economic Times.
Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, acknowledged that efficiency gains from AI are already evident in sectors such as audit, law, and consulting.","If you work in banking, your job security may have recently been called into question.

Morgan Stanley has projected that more than 200,000 European banking jobs could disappear by 2030, warning that artificial intelligence and rapid digitalisation are set to transform the sector in ways not seen for decades, according to a report by the Economic Times.

The analysis, which covers 35 major European lenders employing approximately 2.12 million staff, suggests that banks could reduce their workforce by around 10% within the next five years. This would equate to approximately 212,000 jobs lost across the continent.

For employees in certain areas, the outlook appears particularly bleak.

Which Roles Are Most at Risk?

Morgan Stanley's analysis indicates that job losses are expected to hit 'central services' divisions hardest. These include back-office and middle-office functions, as well as risk management and compliance positions.

The rationale is clear: these roles involve tasks that AI systems can perform more quickly and at lower cost. Monitoring transactions, preparing regulatory reports, and processing large datasets are prime candidates for automation through machine learning tools.

'Many banks have quoted efficiency gains coming from AI and further digitalisation to the tune of 30%,' Morgan Stanley noted in its report.

For workers whose daily responsibilities involve spreadsheets, regulatory checks, and data reconciliation, the implications are stark.

Banks Already Acting on AI Strategies

This forecast is not merely hypothetical. Several European lenders have already begun restructuring with artificial intelligence at the core of their cost-cutting strategies.

In November, Dutch lender ABN Amro announced plans to reduce around one-fifth of its full-time workforce by 2028, according to the Economic Times. The bank has identified AI as increasingly capable of handling tasks currently performed by staff, particularly in operations and compliance functions.

Similarly, in France, Société Générale's chief executive Slawomir Krupa has taken an assertive stance. 'Nothing is sacred', he declared in March, signalling that no division would be exempt from his drive to lower the bank's persistently high costs.

Why the Urgency? Investor Pressure Intensifies

This push towards automation is driven by mounting pressure from shareholders frustrated with European banks' persistently weak returns on equity, especially in comparison with their American counterparts.

Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted that AI offers lenders a new opportunity to improve their cost-to-income ratios—an important efficiency metric closely scrutinised by investors—particularly as traditional cost-cutting measures have 'largely run out of momentum.'

The forecast underscores how increased digitalisation could significantly reshape Europe's banking landscape in the coming years, especially among consumer-focused lenders and in countries like France and Germany, where cost-to-income ratios remain relatively high.

Senior Bankers Urge Caution

Despite the sector-wide push for AI-driven efficiencies, some senior figures within banking are urging restraint.

Conor Hillery, JPMorgan Chase's co-chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, warned against abandoning fundamental skills in the rush to automate. He emphasised that JPMorgan aims to balance AI utilisation—speeding up routine tasks—while ensuring junior staff continue to develop vital skills such as building cash-flow models and analysing price-to-earnings ratios.

'Otherwise, we're storing up a big problem for the future,' Hillery cautioned, according to the Economic Times.

Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, acknowledged that efficiency gains from AI are already evident in sectors such as audit, law, and consulting. However, he noted that banks have yet to fully realise similar benefits. 'Cost bases remain large, and these powerful new tools are still not fully implemented,' he said.

UBS has already begun experimenting with AI-generated content, producing analyst avatars that deliver video updates to clients. The Swiss bank recently sent 250 of its senior leaders to Oxford University for an AI-focused leadership summit.

What Does This Mean for Banking Employees?

For the 2.12 million people currently employed by Europe's major banks, the next four to five years will likely require adaptation—whether through retraining for higher-value roles, transitioning to emerging functions, or exiting the industry altogether.

Morgan Stanley's message is clear: the era of AI-driven banking has arrived, and not everyone will be able to keep pace.",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1780797/ai-adoption.png,N,,2026-01-07 04:13:44.574915

Instead, he decided to build the Exige Lotus never sold here—and then he turned it into something far more extreme than the factory ever dared.
The foundation is a 2005 Lotus Elise, but that’s where anything resembling stock ends.
Up front, Schmauderer imported an Exige V6 nose from overseas, then fabricated custom panels to make it work with the Elise chassis.
Lotus never sold the Exige America wanted, but now the Land of the Free arguably has the most desirable one.","Lotus has skipped the U.S. market plenty of times when it comes to its cars, and the Exige is a great example of that. While the Elise made it Stateside, latter versions of the harder-edged, track-focused Exige were formally kept out of reach; buyers in America could look, but they couldn't touch.

Saxon Schumauderer didn't accept that reality. Instead, he decided to build the Exige Lotus never sold here—and then he turned it into something far more extreme than the factory ever dared.

The foundation is a 2005 Lotus Elise, but that’s where anything resembling stock ends. Up front, Schmauderer imported an Exige V6 nose from overseas, then fabricated custom panels to make it work with the Elise chassis. Around back, things get even more involved: he sourced a wrecked Exige, salvaged the rear clamshell, repaired it, and grafted it onto his car. The result is a car that plenty of folks would likely take as the real deal.

The bodywork is only the appetizer, though. “The hardest part of the build was taking a 200 horsepower engine and building from scratch a complete system that could handle an excess of 1000 horsepower,” Schmauderer told Road & Track.

This was his first turbo build from the ground up, meaning everything, including fabrication, welding, wiring, ECU calibration, and drivetrain, had to be learned the hard way. “There was a lot of trial and error,"" he said. ""The build took many years of tinkering and has had four or five different configurations to make it how it currently sits.”

Originally, Schmauderer tried to make the Elise’s stock Toyota-sourced 2ZZ work. “I initially turboed the stock motor and was mildly boosted, which was still fun, but it maxed out the platform,” he said. Eventually, practicality won out. “I decided on [a new] powertrain after realizing the stock 2ZZ motor wasn’t going to cut the cheese.”

The solution came unexpectedly: a fully built K24/K20 “Frankenstein” Honda engine he scored for just $1500. Now force-fed by a turbocharger, the setup makes around 750 horsepower. That's an almost absurd number for a car that weighs well under 2000 pounds. It sends that power through a manual transmission, with a center-exit exhaust for maximum drama.

And here is maybe the best part: he's not done. Schmauderer already has a larger turbo rated for over 1000 horsepower sitting in the garage. “The goal would be to make the fastest stick-shift Lotus on the quarter mile,” he said. Everything else, he claims, is already ready for four digits. Lotus never sold the Exige America wanted, but now the Land of the Free arguably has the most desirable one. Eat your heart out, everybody else.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitledhjk-695c3153b681c.jpg?crop=0.832xw:0.738xh;0,0.142xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-06 23:59:17.991964

""We've essentially used AI to protect AI from other AIs,"" Prince told Business Insider.
She also leads Hugging Face's Frugal AI Challenge, encouraging academics and industry leaders to deploy AI models with efficiency in mind.
Anthropic bakes what it calls ""constitutional AI"" into its AI models, meaning they are trained on foundational guidelines of ethics and human values.
""Curious people get more done, and we've built a set of AI tools and assistants that help users do more with AI,"" Srinivas told Business Insider.","Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, the AI sector has undergone a significant transformation.

Model capabilities have advanced, agents are proliferating, and enterprises are spending big to roll out AI across their workforces.

At the same time, generative AI-human interactions have started to fuel mental health concerns. Investors continue to wait for their billion-dollar bets to yield returns. Companies contend with whether AI is actually boosting productivity. It's not just models creating friction: the data center boom that underpins AI deployment is straining electric grids and increasing utility bills, raising concerns about the tech's long-term sustainability.

Building the most powerful AI systems at the fastest rate possible is no longer enough to compete in today's AI arms race. Leaders must also consider public safety, trust, and environmental impacts.

So, who's stepping up to these challenges?

Since 2023, Business Insider's AI Power List has recognized the most influential people in AI across sectors. Looking back to the past 12 months, we've identified 25 key players who we believe are shaping this next wave of AI innovation — from the C-suite and behind the scenes.

They include executives designing AI infrastructure, investors betting on long-term value over hype cycles, researchers and activists confronting the social costs of AI, and founders building tools designed to help rather than harm. Together, they represent where AI will go next.

These are the most powerful people in AI.

Citi uses it to process legal documents, assist in regulatory filings, and streamline internal audits, handling millions of queries annually.

In September, as part of a pilot, Citi gave 5,000 workers access to Stylus' agentic capabilities, an initiative that Griffiths said was received well. Citi is also leveraging AI-driven coding assistance with its GitHub Copilot, which Griffiths said has contributed to faster product releases and more consistency.

""AI can be perceived as more of a mysterious thing that's going to be done to us, and people have trepidation around it,"" Griffiths told Business Insider. ""What we're seeing is: Actually, no, that's not what you need to worry about.""

In his current role, Griffiths integrates governance and security protocols across Citi's global technology systems to ensure the responsible deployment of AI.

""The efficiency opportunity this gives us — not only getting tasks done quicker, but helping us simplify the entire operations of the company — is a massive unlock,"" Griffiths told Business Insider.

Peggy Johnson

CEO, Agility Robotics

Career highlights:

Oversaw the opening of RoboFab, the world's first manufacturing facility in Salem, Oregon, with the capacity to build up to 10,000 humanoids a year

Former CEO of Magic Leap, an augmented reality company

Why they made our list:

Johnson is turning the humanoid market from hype to commercial reality. Under her leadership, Agility Robotics rolled out Digit through small-scale pilots and deployments in factories and warehouses owned by companies such as Amazon.

As of November, Digit has moved more than 100,000 warehouse bins since its commercial deployment last year, an early indicator that humanoids can be scaled with a return on investment. For years, humanoid robots were largely confined to laboratories and demonstrations, with skeptics doubting they could ever perform useful, everyday tasks that save companies time and money. Agility's milestone suggests that Digit can handle repetitive, physical tasks — the next iteration of warehouse automation.

""As AI technology improved and refined, we have been able to dramatically accelerate Digit's ability to learn new skills,"" Johnson told Business Insider.

Agility is now working to expand Digit's capabilities from simply picking up objects to understanding real-world context so that its humanoids can work alongside humans. As of late March, Agility reportedly raised $400 million in funds to improve its humanoid robots, which puts its pre-investment valuation at an estimated $1.75 billion, The Information reported.

Megan Garcia

Safety Advocate

Career highlights:

Following her 14-year-old son's death, she sued Character.AI, an AI companion startup, on allegations that its product is unsafe for children

Testified before Congress on AI-induced psychological harm

Why they made our list:

Garcia, a lawyer by trade, has publicly shared her story to warn others about the psychological dangers of AI following her young son's February 2024 death. Sewell Setzer III, who was 14 at the time, died by suicide following distressing interactions with Character.AI's chatbot, Garcia said.

In September, Garcia testified before Congress, urging lawmakers to hold tech companies accountable for releasing AI systems that can harm vulnerable users. Following her advocacy and as of November 25, Character.AI barred users under age 18 from interacting with its AI companions, a move that OpenAI and Meta followed by adding limitations for underage users. Hearing from many parents with similar stories, Garcia warns that children risk losing their personhood and privacy to AI systems designed to extract their innermost thoughts for profit.

""Many parents don't understand that chatbot systems collect data on children's most intimate thoughts, impressions, feelings, and secrets — things that we as parents don't even know about,"" Garcia told Business Insider. ""These companies have access to that and have no right to it.""

The stock's price tripled in 2023 and doubled in 2024, and added another market-beating 40% gain in 2025.

Despite that impressive bull run, the stock enters 2026 trading at just 25 times this year's consensus earnings estimate, and 46 times trailing earnings. While there are risks to watch, this valuation also sets up the prospect of another year of substantial gains for shareholders.

Nvidia's growth prospects remain attractive

There are risks for the company that are holding Nvidia's stock valuation down. Wall Street is pricing in the potential for a slowdown in spending on AI infrastructure, while also accounting for the increasing competition in the AI chip market.

Still, leading cloud service providers continue to see demand for compute capacity outpace supply, which is good news for Nvidia. Nvidia's cloud customers are buying every graphics processing unit (GPU) the company can supply.

Admittedly, the EliteBoard G1a is essentially a business laptop that's had the screen ripped off and the sides all chopped away.
However, the EliteBoard G1a can be configured to house a 32 Wh battery.
And yet, despite all its limitations, the EliteBoard G1a reminds me somewhat of the first home computers I used in the early 1980s.","Ask any tech vendor and they'll always tell you that smaller is better. CPUs and GPUs have never been tinier underneath the heatsink, but PCs themselves are still big and boxy. Not so HP's newly launched EliteBoard G1a range, because at under 780 grams in weight and 36 cm in length, it's possibly one of the smallest PCs around.

Admittedly, the EliteBoard G1a is essentially a business laptop that's had the screen ripped off and the sides all chopped away. But even so, the remaining keyboard still sports a numpad (though the whole thing is too compact to be classed as full-sized) and the internal gubbins are respectable enough, if just not very potent.

Not that HP is aiming the EliteBoard at gamers, of course. This is an AI PC for business users (the dedicated Copilot button really stands out), but if you got one with the best processor on offer, then you could do a spot of handheld-like gaming while pretending to juggle spreadsheets at work.

The chip in question is an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 Pro, which is a Kracken Point APU, with eight Zen 5 cores (4x Zen 5, 4x Zen 5c) and a Radeon 860M integrated GPU. That sports eight RDNA 3.5 compute units, which equate to 512 shaders. That's roughly the same as the Steam Deck's GPU, so it should give you an idea as to what kind of gaming you can do on it.

HP also offers the EliteBoard G1a with a Ryzen AI 5 340 Pro (six CPU cores, four GPU compute units) or the miserable Ryzen 3 330 (four CPU cores, two GPU compute units), so if you were offered a G1a at work, I know which chip I'd be demanding.

Naturally, for such a market, RAM options are limited to a maximum of 64 GB, in the form of two DDR5-5600 SODIMMS, and up to 2 TB of Gen 4 NVMe storage. For some reason that I can't fathom just yet, the Ryzen 7 350 variant comes with 32 GB of eMMC flash storage, whereas the others don't. Answers on a postcard as to what one can genuinely use that for.

The whole caboodle requires a 65 W power supply to run, and you can provide that either via the provided adapter, or if you have a suitable monitor, you can use the same USB Type-C cable for sending the display signal. However, the EliteBoard G1a can be configured to house a 32 Wh battery.

For connectivity options, it's barebones, I'm afraid: just two USB Type-C ports (USB4 and USB 3.2 10 Gbps), and either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7. Oh, and Bluetooth 5.3 or 6, depending on what Wi-Fi module you choose. There's no LAN port, SD card reader, or anything else.

And yet, despite all its limitations, the EliteBoard G1a reminds me somewhat of the first home computers I used in the early 1980s. Those were very much the same thing: just a keyboard with a couple of sockets, plus a cable for the TV and one more for power.

Even though they were incredibly basic, I enjoyed years of programming and gaming on them, and I dare say the same thing could happen with this svelte HP.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9ozn9B2ifHCo4dQTVC9RH-2560-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 00:58:25.278952

An update from Plug Power ( (PLUG) ) is now available.

On December 30, 2025, Plug Power entered into a 15-year Release Event License Agreement with Walmart that establishes a contingency framework for Walmart to access escrowed GenKey System-related software, documentation and materials solely for internal maintenance of its facilities if certain defined release events occur, while Plug Power retains all intellectual property rights. The agreement also sets out Plug Power’s efforts to qualify alternative fuel cell stack suppliers, gives Walmart limited conditional rights around stack sourcing, provides for compensation to Walmart under certain circumstances for costs to sustain industrial truck operations, and structures a tiered fee arrangement under which Walmart pays one-time and annual license fees that increase if a release event is triggered. As part of the deal, Walmart irrevocably terminated a 2017 transaction agreement and forfeited all vested portions of a warrant to purchase Plug Power common stock, with all unvested portions cancelled, thereby eliminating potential future dilution of up to 42,192,479 shares and removing 34,554,185 vested warrant shares and 7,638,294 unvested shares from Plug Power’s future share issuance overhang.

The most recent analyst rating on (PLUG) stock is a Buy with a $3.00 price target. To see the full list of analyst forecasts on Plug Power stock, see the PLUG Stock Forecast page.

Spark’s Take on PLUG Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, PLUG is a Neutral.

Plug Power’s overall stock score reflects significant financial challenges, with persistent losses impacting profitability and cash flow. However, positive strategic initiatives and corporate events provide some optimism. Technical analysis and valuation remain moderate, with mixed signals and a challenging valuation due to ongoing losses. The earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth and strategic positioning, contributing positively to the score.

The technology service provider has revealed that consumers now prioritize fairness and transparency, with 71% of respondents agreeing they would switch brands if pack sizes or quality of products were decreased without prior communication.

Furthermore, the report highlights how AI tools have become significantly more influential in online shopping; however, consumers still expect transparency when AI comes into play.

The report, which surveyed 12,000 consumers, uncovers that even as technology grows in the retail space, human interaction remains essential to its success.

Fairness and Transparency

Despite low pricing still driving significant revenue, fairness and transparency are also key to defining value for a brand.

This comes with clear communication; if one brand can clearly advertise its products with promotional and valuable deals, customers are keen to switch their loyalty to brands that can provide this.

In fact, 74% of consumers revealed they would switch brands if they had found lower prices elsewhere, as well as 61% agreeing that promotional bundles that combine products with higher value services are worth purchasing. These can include guaranteed faster deliveries, or product benefits that assure cleanliness, health, or environmental advantages.

Priyanka Bhargav, Head of Insights and Brand Strategy at Flipkart, argues that consumers are more likely to spend more for free delivery promotions, discounts, and bundles if brands can advertise these extras as valuable:

“These customers are willing to pay a little extra for faster delivery, signaling that convenience and immediacy are becoming universal expectations.”

Low pricing cannot get the results on its own, brands that can provide meaningful experiences with clear transparency to their consumers will set the expectations in the industry.

However, consumers are still willing to purchase products that are more expensive, as the report notes an increase in customer assessments, not just product, quality, and price, but also the brand itself.

If a brand can prove it holds itself to reliable, transparent, and ethical standards, they are more likely to see an increase in consumer loyalty.

Transparency is more than clear communication, it influences trust and loyalty by demonstrating how it puts customers first.

Brand Connection

Consumers are also willing to stay with a brand if their loyalty is already established, usually if there’s a previous level of trust and admiration, especially if it’s for both parties.

For example, a consumer who works or has previously worked with a brand may stay loyal when making purchasing decisions as a personal connection has previously been established.

If a brand is already well-established, with high-end luxury shops such as Chanel or Gucci, this can foster brand loyalty without the need for promotional bundles, but having already positioned itself as a stereotypical desired brand.

Customers are unlikely to move to a non-luxury brand during price increases or product changes as this comes with the brand expectations, consumers of high-retail brands are likely to remain loyal as customers remain trusting in their company decisions.

This is also true of child-centered brands, where parents are more likely to remain loyal to a brand during price increases or product changes if their child is showing positive signs with a brand compared to another.

In regard to pricing, customers may also choose to stay with a brand long-term if it offers customized benefits and rewards for remaining loyal.

In the report, 70% of consumers agreed that personalized coupons based on their purchase history was a good practice, as well as 68% of consumers believed that member-only pricing for loyalty program subscribers was a good idea.

These practices provide emotional brand connection, if consumers believe they are being offered reduced prices to help with their everyday purchases, they are more likely to stay.

AI Tools in Shopping

AI tools are becoming a staple of online shopping services, no longer in experimentation but readily accessible to customers throughout their shopping journey.

The report reveals that 2025 saw a quarter of respondents having used Gen AI shopping tools to enhance their decision-making, as well as over 73% of consumers having used a chatbot for query resolution at least once.

These tools provide customers with out-of-hours support, product availability, and promotions for discounted purchases.

These AI bots can also be used to continue customer engagement even after a purchase is made, with 61% of consumers having received personalized follow-ups and 54% satisfied with the results, featuring product instructions, tips, and recommendations.

By offering post-purchase support, brands can boost their customer engagement and increase future purchases.

However, almost half of the respondents who use chatbots are not satisfied with the experience, as many retail bots still lack the ability to deliver human-level capabilities, or even transfer consumers to a human support agent.

Friction AI bot experiences can taint a consumer’s impression of a brand, increasing disengagement and disappointment.

This has led to only 8% of respondents agreeing they would pay a monthly fee for a chatbots or AI assistant to make automatic purchases on their behalf, highlighting how AI bots still have a long way to go before building absolute customer trust.

Currently, 76% of consumers want to set boundaries for these digital assistants; by ensuring customer control around preferences, privacy, data management, and shopping experiences, AI can enhance its relevance in the industry if the customer is confident in the bot’s actions.

By first introducing clear transparency around data governance, compliance and security measures, brands can then introduce customers to AI assistant perks, personalizations, and rewards.",https://www.cxtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Capgemini-Reveals-How-Transparency-and-Connection-Now-Drives-Consumer-Loyalty.png,N,,2026-01-07 08:00:40.927501

If this has you thinking beyond packaged foods, it could be a good moment to widen your search with and spot companies where growth and insider conviction line up.

With Kraft Heinz shares lagging over 1 and 3 years, yet trading at a discount to analyst targets and some models of intrinsic value, you have to ask: is this a reset level that offers upside, or is the market already pricing in all the growth ahead?

Most Popular Narrative: 13.3% Undervalued

With Kraft Heinz last closing at US$23.51 against a narrative fair value of US$27.13, the current gap is all about what future earnings power looks like.

Ongoing portfolio optimization divesting non-core brands and reinvesting into high-margin segments and key power brands should lead to structurally higher operating margins and improved profitability in future periods. Continued disciplined investment in marketing and the Brand Growth System, especially in North America retail, is already showing performance improvement and is expected to stabilize and eventually reaccelerate top line revenue while maintaining pricing power in an environment of rising consumer price sensitivity.

CES is a huge opportunity annually for companies both large and small to parade products they plan to put on shelves this year. As predicted, artificial intelligence was anchored in nearly everything as tech firms continue to look for AI products that will attract customers.

Here are the highlights from Day 1:

Nvidia gets physical

The biggest buzzword in the air at CES is ""physical AI,"" Nvidia's term for AI models that are trained in a virtual environment using computer generated, ""synthetic"" data, then deployed as physical machines once they've mastered their purpose.

CEO Jensen Huang showed off Cosmos, an AI foundation model trained on massive datasets, capable of simulating environments governed by actual physics. He also announced Alpamayo, an AI model specifically designed for autonomous driving. Huang revealed that Nvidia's next generation AI superchip platform, dubbed Vera Rubin, is in full production, and that Nvidia has a new partnership with Siemens. All of this shows Nvidia is going to fight increased competition to retain its reputation as the backbone of the AI industry.

But once Huang called for two little, waddling, chirping robots to join him on stage, that's all the audience wanted to see more of.

The chips are back in town

AMD CEO Lisa Su announced a new line of its famed Ryzen AI processors as the company continues to expand its footprint in the world of AI-powered personal computers.

For gamers, AMD also showed off the latest version of its gaming-focused processor, the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D.

Meanwhile, Intel announced its new AI chip for laptops, Panther Lake (also known as the Intel Core Ultra Series 3), and said the company has plans to launch a new platform to address a growing market for handheld video gaming machines.

WATCH: What's next for AI and has its explosive growth in 2025 created a bubble?

Intel, a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone. It fell further behind after the AI boom propelled Nvidia into the spotlight.

President Donald Trump's administration stepped in recently to secure a 10% stake in the company, making the government one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel to support U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.

Uber dives back into the robotaxi game

Uber is giving the public a first look at their robotaxi at CES this week. Uber, along with luxury electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Motors and vehicle tech company Nuro, introduced an autonomous vehicle with an Uber-designed in-cabin experience.

Uber calls it the most luxurious robotaxi yet. It features cameras, sensors and radars that provide 360-degree perception and a low-profile roof ""halo"" with integrated LEDs that will display riders' initials to help them spot their car and track their ride status. Inside, riders can personalize everything from climate and seat heating to music, while real-time visuals show exactly what the vehicle is seeing on the road and the route it plans to take.

Autonomous on-road testing began last month in San Francisco, led by Nuro, marking a major step toward what the companies said is a planned launch before the end of the year.

Star Wars and Lego announce a new partnership

When Lucasfilm chief creative officer David Filoni brought out an array of X-Wing pilots, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C-3PO, he won the Star Wars fandom for Lego.

Lego announced its Lego Smart Play platform on Monday, which introduces new smart bricks, tags and special minifigs for your collection. The new bricks contain sensors that enable them to sense light and distance, and to provide an array of responses, essentially lights and sounds, when they are used in unison.

Combine this with a newly announced partnership with the Star Wars franchise and now you can create your own interactive space battles and light-saber duels.

LG reveals a new robot to help around the home

File this one under intrigued, for now.

The Korean tech giant gave the media a glimpse Monday of its humanoid robot that is designed to handle household chores such as folding laundry and fetching food. Although many companies have robots on display at CES, LG certainly is one of the biggest tech companies to promise to put a service robot in homes.

It will be on display beginning Tuesday, so we'll have more to report soon.

What's new with lollipops?

Music you can taste was on display Monday at CES: Lollipop Star unveiled a candy that plays music while you eat it. The company says it uses something called ""bone induction technology,"" which lets you hear songs — like tracks from Ice Spice and Akon — through the lollipop as you lick it or bite it in the back of your mouth, according to spokesperson Cassie Lawrence.

The musical lollipops will go on sale after CES on Lollipop Star's website for $8.99 each. And if that wasn't enough star power, Akon was expected to visit the company's booth Tuesday when CES opens to the public.

Atlas holds up Hyundai's (manufacturing) world

Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics publicly demonstrated its humanoid robot Atlas for the first time at the CES tech showcase, ratcheting up a competition with Tesla and other rivals to build robots that look like people and do things that people do.

The company said a version of the robot that will help assemble cars is already in production and will be deployed by 2028 at Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility near Savannah, Georgia.

Delta gets spherical

Delta Air Lines is taking entertainment to new heights as the ""official airline"" of the Sphere in Las Vegas. The airline announced a new multiyear partnership with Sphere Entertainment Co. that it says will deliver premium experiences to the venue, including a Delta SKY360° Club lounge.

The carrier said SkyMiles members can unlock exclusive access to other experiences at the Sphere, starting during the final weekend of the Backstreet Boys' residency in February with features including private suite seating, food and beverages. The partnership brings Delta branding to the Sphere's massive exterior LED screen. Delta says more exclusive SkyMiles experiences will roll out in 2026 and beyond.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-05T185132Z_686794914_RC23VIAGP4O2_RTRMADP_3_TECH-CES-1024x646.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 01:59:20.294177

Former Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told Skift in September that the ultra-low-cost carrier was also considering an in-flight Wi-Fi option.
Delta Air Lines also has free Wi-Fi on most of its domestic and international flights.","American Airlines launched free in-flight Wi-Fi Tuesday, joining a growing industry trend that has carriers racing to offer travelers high-speed connections.

The airline said it would roll out the free Wi-Fi in phases across all of its narrowbodies and dual-class regional fleets, and expects the installation to be complete by early spring. American’s new Boeing 787-9 and 787-8 will also feature free Wi-Fi.

The Wi-Fi is free only for members of American’s loyalty program. AT&T is sponsoring the service and Viasat and Intelsat are providing the connectivity.

American was reportedly in talks with Amazon for Leo in-flight Wi-Fi, according to Bloomberg News. American did not confirm whether it was considering Amazon.

“American Airlines is committed to delivering an enhanced customer experience that meets the expectations of today’s travelers and to ensure as such, we are constantly in conversation with various companies and groups to discuss future opportunities,” American said in a statement to Skift.

Free Wi-Fi has become an increasingly popular option for airlines as the industry looks to cater to more premium and business travelers. JetBlue was the first U.S. carrier to offer free Wi-Fi in 2013 and is now the launch customer for Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a competitor to Starlink. Former Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told Skift in September that the ultra-low-cost carrier was also considering an in-flight Wi-Fi option.

United Airlines started offering free in-flight connectivity through Starlink in 2025. Delta Air Lines also has free Wi-Fi on most of its domestic and international flights.

American’s Premium Push

American has also made a host of changes to its customer experience to capitalize on the premium boom that has led its competitors — Delta and United — to report record profits. Some of the other changes include bringing back champagne to business class, partnering with Italian coffee company Lavazza, and expanding business class to more routes.

American was the first U.S. carrier to debut the Airbus A321XLR, an “extra-long-range” single-aisle jet that can travel transatlantic and transcontinental routes. The new aircraft features 20 new Flagship suites — American’s business class product.

During the 2025 Skift Aviation Forum, American chief customer officer Heather Garboden said premium demand has been the most resilient. She added that American aims to increase the number of premium seats by 30% by the end of the decade and 50% across long-haul flights.

“We’ll have more free satellite-based Wi-Fi on our aircraft than any other airline in the entire world,” she said. “So while I think premium demand is kind of the focus right now, I have no doubt that whether that changes over the next decade or so or it doesn’t, we also are focused on all customers, not necessarily just premium.”","https://skift.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2K4A3209-scaled-e1715613640958.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2026-01-07 07:00:31.217116

Quantum is the next frontier, with quantum-ready organizations worldwide three times more likely to belong to multiple ecosystems than their least ready counterparts.

DUBAI, UAE – The IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) has unveiled Five Trends for 2026, a new report identifying the forces that will redefine competitive advantage for organizations in the UAE and around the world in the year ahead. As 2026 begins, the research shows that uncertainty isn’t slowing business down it’s accelerating transformation.

To thrive, companies are doubling down on technologies that provide speed, resilience, and insight. AI has shifted from experimental to essential, redefining decisions, roles, and customer expectations at an unprecedented pace. Enterprises are moving towards operating with AI at the core, and soon, quantum will help tackle their most complex problems.

“The findings point to a fundamental shift in how organizations are approaching growth and competitiveness in 2026,” said Shukri Eid, General Manager, IBM Gulf Levant and Pakistan. “In the UAE, leaders are accelerating decision-making, embedding AI at the core of their operations, and strengthening resilience and sovereignty across their technology environments. At the same time, there is a clear focus on building trust - with employees, customers, and partners - as AI becomes more deeply integrated into everyday business. Together, these priorities are shaping organizations that are better prepared to adapt, collaborate across ecosystems, and take advantage of emerging technologies such as quantum.”

Fast decisions turn disruption into opportunity

Of the executives surveyed in the UAE, 95% say they increasingly need to make fast decisions, and all believe the highest-stakes decisions they made in 2025 were the right ones – that’s 4% above the global average. Uncertainty can become the greatest business asset for those who embrace it, with 63% of the respondents saying economic and geopolitical volatility will create new business opportunities for their organizations in 2026. The report notes that 93% of UAE executives fear they’ll lose their edge if they can’t operate in real time.

Employees are ready to embrace AI-driven role changes

The research shows that employees no longer fear AI they want to embrace it, even if that means their roles will change significantly. Globally, 81% are confident they can keep up with new technologies, and 61% think AI makes their job less mundane and more strategic. Across all generational groups from digital natives to seasoned veterans at least twice as many employees would welcome rather than resist greater use of AI by their employers in 2026. In addition, 63% would work with an AI agent.

Consumers are excited about AI, but transparency is mandatory

While consumers don’t need AI to be flawless, they do need to be in the loop. Easy-to-understand explanations of how AI is using their data are what make consumers most comfortable engaging with it. Among the consumers surveyed worldwide, 89% want to know when they’re interacting with AI, and four in five say they would trust a brand less if it intentionally concealed AI use. Two-thirds would switch brands – and half would even pay more – to avoid hidden AI. Meanwhile, 95% of global executives believe consumer trust in their AI will define the success of new products and services.

AI resilience and sovereignty become essential

In the face of growing uncertainty, AI resilience and sovereignty – an organization’s ability to control and govern its AI systems, data, and infrastructure at all times – have become mission-critical. In the UAE, 98% of executives say AI resilience and sovereignty must be part of their 2026 strategy, and 63% worry about overdependence on compute resources.

Quantum will require deep ecosystem collaboration

Quantum demands resources no single entity can realistically maintain alone in short, it takes an ecosystem, or several. Quantum-ready organizations (QROs) worldwide are three times more likely to participate in multiple ecosystems than their least ready counterparts. In the UAE, four in five executives (80%) say ecosystem partners help accelerate technology adoption, while 88% believe these partners enable their company to limit the impact of disruption, and an equal number agree that partner data improves business outcomes. The findings indicate that enterprises forging the best ecosystem alliances today are positioning themselves to lead in the quantum era.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK), bringing to a close more than three decades of continuous service on one of its longest-standing transatlantic routes. The final departure from New York took place on January 5, 2026, with the last return flight from Brussels on January 6.

The last flight DL141 from Brussels to New York JFK was operated by Boeing 767-332(ER) registered N196DN. It took off at 12:34 (UTC+1) instead of its scheduled time of departure at 11:00, due to weather conditions in Brussels. The estimated arrival time at JFK is 14:20 (UTC-5), only half an hour late.

Short History of the Route

The Brussels–New York service was inaugurated in December 1991, with Delta operating Airbus A310 equipment on a daily basis, marking the beginning of its direct link between the Belgian capital and the United States. Over the years, the carrier updated the route with larger wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 767-300ER, cementing its role as a key transatlantic connection. This service played a crucial role not only in leisure travel but also significantly for diplomatic and business traffic, given Brussels’ role as the seat of the European Union and NATO.

Like many international routes, the service was temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) but was restored as travel demand recovered, operating four weekly flights in recent seasons.

Strategic shift: From New York to Atlanta

Delta’s decision to end the JFK–Brussels service is part of a broader network realignment intended to strengthen its transatlantic operations and optimise profitability. Instead of serving Belgium from New York year-round, the airline is shifting focus to its major hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). Beginning March 8, 2026, Delta will expand its Atlanta–Brussels schedule, initially with four weekly flights before moving to daily service during the peak travel season.

Delta’s executives have indicated that the shift reflects changes in market demand, especially in fare-sensitive economy cabins, and greater strategic value in feeding Brussels traffic through Atlanta’s extensive domestic and international connecting network.

For passengers based in the New York area, this move means the loss of a direct flight option to Brussels on Delta; travellers will instead have to connect via Atlanta or opt for other carriers.

Competitive landscape on the Brussels–New York Corridor

The competitive environment on the Brussels–New York corridor has been a persistent strategic challenge for Delta:

Brussels Airlines: As Belgium’s flag carrier and a member of the Star Alliance (via the Lufthansa Group), Brussels Airlines operates daily direct service between Brussels and New York-JFK, typically using Airbus A330-300 aircraft. Its strong local brand and alliance connectivity have made it a dominant player on this route.

United Airlines: A major U.S. competitor, United operates daily non-stop flights from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Brussels, diversifying connections to the U.S. East Coast and beyond.

Delta’s Position: Unlike in other European markets such as Amsterdam or Paris, Delta does not have a joint-venture partner in Brussels, limiting its access to broader connecting traffic flows that alliance partners can provide. This has historically constrained Delta’s ability to capture a larger share of connecting travellers beyond point-to-point passengers.

With Delta’s exit from the direct New York service, Brussels Airlines will once again become the sole operator of nonstop flights between Brussels and JFK, while United will continue to serve the market from Newark.

Wider market and strategic implications

This route termination should be understood in the context of broader shifts in transatlantic aviation:

Open Skies Framework: Under the EU–US Open Skies Agreement, carriers from EU and U.S. countries can freely operate transatlantic services. While this has fostered competition, it also subjects airlines to intense fare pressure and the need for scale and alliances to sustain profitability.

Delta’s Network Optimisation: By focusing on Atlanta—where Delta controls a large share of connecting flows and has strong joint-venture partnerships with Air France–KLM and Virgin Atlantic—the airline aims to leverage its hub strength to better serve European markets, including Belgium.

Alliance Dynamics: The absence of a SkyTeam partner based in Brussels contrasts with Star Alliance’s integrated position via Brussels Airlines and United, illustrating how alliance networks shape competitive advantage on transatlantic routes.

Perspective and future outlook

The end of Delta’s Brussels–New York nonstop service marks a symbolic shift in transatlantic aviation. For Brussels, travellers and businesses lose a legacy direct link that has operated for 34 years. However, the market will remain well-served by alliance and incumbent carriers, and connectivity to the United States continues through diversified gateways.

For Delta, the strategic choice to channel Brussels traffic through Atlanta reflects a prioritisation of hub connectivity and network efficiency in a competitive global air travel market. How this strategy will perform in the medium term will depend on consumer demand for seamless connections, competitive responses from other carriers, and evolving alliance structures.",https://www.aviation24.be/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Delta_Air_Lines_B767-332_N1611B_Brussels_Airport_25L.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:59:18.962581

Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin architecture was launched earlier than expected at CES, joined by announcements for its own Tesla-rivaling self-driving car technology, and the latest updates coming to DLSS, G-Sync display tech, and the GeForce Now cloud gaming platform.

While none of these hold quite the same appeal as a new generation of consumer graphics cards — something we might see at CES 2027, following the RTX 50-series launch last year — it can still be a lot to parse, especially through the vast slurry of everything else being promoted at the giant Consumer Electronics Show. We’ve rounded up the most significant announcements that Nvidia has made so far to help you stay on top of the news.

Vera Rubin ‘AI supercomputer’

Nvidia launched the Vera Rubin platform during its CES keynote, its next-generation successor to the Blackwell architecture that’s currently used in its most powerful AI chips. Nvidia says this new architecture, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, can train large “mixture of experts” (MoE) AI models as quickly as Blackwell, but with far greater efficiency. Dion Harris, Nvidia’s senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as “six chips that make one AI supercomputer,” which include the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, NVLink 6th-gen switch, Connect-X9 NIC, BlueField4 DPU, and Spectrum-X 102.4T CPO.

Autonomous driving solutions

Nvidia is racing against Tesla and Waymo to build technology that will allow cars to fully drive themselves without human assistance, and it may now have the edge. Alpamayo, a newly announced portfolio of AI models, simulation blueprints, and datasets, can give vehicles level 4 autonomy — allowing them to fully drive themselves under specific conditions. “Not only does it take sensor input and activates steering wheel, brakes, and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it is about to take,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the presentation.

The first passenger car that will be available with this tech is the new Mercedes-Benz CLA, with AI-assisted driving features coming to the US this year. Nvidia’s answer to Full Self-Driving is impressive, according to my colleague Andrew J. Hawkins, who took it for a test-drive, and says that Tesla should be concerned.

DLSS 4.5 is here

The next major update to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature is now available for all RTX GPUs, providing improvements to image quality and fewer artifacts compared to DLSS 4. This DLSS 4.5 update includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and is supported across more than 400 games and apps via Nvidia’s app.

This is the technology that allows supported games to be played at higher resolutions without compromising frame rates, a valuable feature for PC gamers with older Nvidia RTX graphics cards in their systems. Those with newer GPUs will see greater benefits from DLSS 4.5, however: it will run faster on RTX 40- and 50-series cards and provides a 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that generates up to five additional frames for every frame rendered.

GeForce Now is coming to Linux and Fire TV

Nvidia is planning to launch native GeForce Now apps for Linux and Amazon’s Fire TV devices in the coming months, giving more people who may not have adequate gaming hardware access to the cloud streaming service. The first beta will be available for the Ubuntu 24.04 Linux distro, before expanding to additional distributions in the coming weeks. A GeForce Now app for Fire TV Stick 4K Plus and 4K Max is expected to launch early this year. Nvidia is also introducing full flight control support for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in GeForce Now, allowing joysticks and yokes from Thrustmaster and Logitech to work on the cloud gaming service.

New G-Sync monitors

A new set of G-Sync Pulsar monitors is launching on January 7th that use a built-in light sensor to automatically adjust brightness and color based on your room lighting. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate, with prices starting at $599.

“In bright daylight conditions, it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-153250.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.8395719693116%2C100%2C92.320856061377&w=1200,N,,2026-01-06 20:00:53.733164

The exclusive data and analysis provides shippers and carriers a composite view of truck freight costs, including average-per-mile contract, spot and fuel rates.

The first publication of the U.S. Bank Freight Payment Index – Rates Edition revealed that spot rates jumped 3.0% in October before falling 1.1% to $1.65 per mile in November. Contract rates have held steady in recent months and were at $2.02 in November. Both spot and contract rates are up less than 1% when compared with a year earlier.

Fuel surcharges, meanwhile, jumped 7.5% in November due to refinery outages. The report noted that “national diesel prices dropped that month … a reminder that fuel surcharges don’t always track pump prices in real time.”

“Our collaboration with DAT Freight & Analytics is about building on the insights we can deliver to shippers and carriers so they can make better business decisions,” said Jeff Pape, General Manager of U.S. Bank Freight Payment. “In addition to the volume and spend data and analysis included in our Freight Payments Index, we know our clients will value the spot, contract and fuel rates in this additional report.”

“The freight market is rarely one-dimensional, and looking at financial or rate data in isolation only tells half the story,” said Ken Adamo, GM, Shipper and Chief of Analytics at DAT. “By layering DAT’s benchmark analytics on top of transaction volume from U.S. Bank, we’re helping shippers bridge the gap between settlement data and real-time market dynamics. This composite view moves the industry beyond simple observation to actionable intelligence, ensuring stakeholders can anticipate volatility rather than just reacting to it.”

The new research complements the U.S. Bank Freight Payment Index, which the bank has published quarterly since 2017. The Index measures quantitative changes in freight shipments and spend activity based on data from transactions processed through U.S. Bank Freight Payment, which processes more than $43 billion in freight payments annually.

The Canadian fast-food holding company will take the entire second floor at 6100 Waterford District Drive, spanning 43K SF, from L'Oréal, Bisnow has learned.

The lease was first made public in Savills' fourth-quarter office report, and an RBI spokesperson confirmed the deal in a statement Tuesday.

RBI's new office space is within the 250-acre Waterford Business District. It represents an expansion in the sprawling office park — the company's corporate headquarters and Burger King's corporate office are located at 5707 Waterford Drive. RBI also has corporate offices in Toronto, Singapore and Zug, Switzerland.

“As we continue to grow our business in the US and globally, we are expanding our restaurant support centers in Miami to allow each of Burger King and Popeyes to have dedicated space — just down the street from each other,” an RBI representative said in a statement.

The spokesperson added that RBI plans to renovate the space.

The space used to serve as the headquarters of Parbel, a perfume and cosmetics subsidiary of L’Oréal. The company renewed its lease at the four-story, 163K SF office in 2019, Commercial Search reported at the time.

The lease term ends in August 2027, according to a JLL marketing brochure provided to Bisnow. The space has 233 workstations, 31 collaboration rooms and 10 open collaboration areas, according to the brochure.

L’Oréal did not respond to a request for comment.

JLL brokers Ryan Levy and Iker Belauste, who represented L’Oréal in the deal, declined to comment. Colliers' Jonathan Kingsley, who represented RBI in the deal, also declined to comment.

While it was unclear when the cosmetics company began marketing the space, the deal was one of the largest signed in the last quarter of 2025, according to Savills.

The Strategy of Scale: Vials, Vouchers, and Volume The core of Eli Lilly’s 2026 playbook is a transition that analysts have dubbed ""The Great Scaling.""
However, following a staggering $50 billion multi-year investment in manufacturing, Lilly entered 2026 with a ""supply chain moat"" that its rivals are struggling to bridge.
Summary and Investor Outlook Eli Lilly’s 2026 strategy represents a bold bet on the industrialization of weight loss.
The combination of a $1 trillion valuation, a massive manufacturing ""moat,"" and a looming oral drug launch positions Lilly as the definitive leader of the obesity market.","As of January 6, 2026, the landscape of the pharmaceutical industry has been fundamentally reshaped by Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY), which recently became the first healthcare entity to surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization. This historic milestone is not merely a reflection of past successes but a validation of the company’s aggressive 2026 strategic pivot: a decisive shift from ""scarcity economics"" to ""access economics."" By prioritizing massive volume growth over high per-unit pricing, Lilly is attempting to saturate the global obesity market and squeeze out competitors before they can achieve meaningful scale.

The immediate implications of this strategy are already being felt across the healthcare continuum. With the launch of a new ""vial-first"" distribution model and the imminent regulatory decision for its oral GLP-1, orforglipron, Lilly is moving to capture the millions of patients previously sidelined by high costs or needle phobia. This ""volume-led"" approach signals the end of the early-adoption phase of the obesity gold rush, transitioning instead into a mature, high-output industrial race where manufacturing capacity and distribution reach are the primary determinants of victory.

The Strategy of Scale: Vials, Vouchers, and Volume

The core of Eli Lilly’s 2026 playbook is a transition that analysts have dubbed ""The Great Scaling."" For the past two years, the narrative surrounding Zepbound (tirzepatide) was dominated by shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks. However, following a staggering $50 billion multi-year investment in manufacturing, Lilly entered 2026 with a ""supply chain moat"" that its rivals are struggling to bridge. New high-capacity facilities in Indiana, North Carolina, and a massive $6.5 billion API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) plant in Texas have finally reached operational maturity, allowing the company to move away from the complex autoinjector pens that previously limited supply.

A critical component of this volume surge is the aggressive expansion of the LillyDirect platform. In a move that sent shockwaves through the industry in late 2025, Lilly slashed the self-pay price for Zepbound vials to between $299 and $350 per month. This pricing strategy is specifically designed to dismantle the gray market of compounded weight-loss drugs and to make the therapy accessible to the middle-class ""cash-pay"" segment. Furthermore, Lilly is preparing for the April 1, 2026, launch of a landmark Medicare Part D pilot program, which will provide a structured pathway for millions of seniors to access obesity medications through negotiated government rates—a move that was unthinkable just 24 months ago.

The strategic focus has also shifted toward the ""oral wave."" Eli Lilly’s once-daily pill, orforglipron, is currently under priority review with an FDA decision expected by March 2026. Unlike injectable biologics, orforglipron is a small-molecule drug, making it significantly cheaper and faster to produce at scale. By positioning this pill as a ""maintenance therapy"" for patients who have reached their goal weight on injectables, Lilly is creating a lifelong treatment loop that prioritizes long-term patient retention over one-time high-margin sales.

Winners and Losers in the New Obesity Economy

The primary beneficiary of this strategy, thus far, has been Eli Lilly itself, as it currently commands a 71% share of new U.S. obesity prescriptions. However, the shift to volume-led growth is creating a polarized environment for other players. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) remains the most formidable challenger, having launched its own oral Wegovy pill in early January 2026 with a disruptive $149 ""starter price."" While Novo remains a ""winner"" in terms of clinical reputation, it is currently locked in a brutal price war with Lilly that is compressing margins across the sector, forcing both giants to rely on sheer scale to maintain profit growth.

On the other side of the ledger, the ""losers"" in 2026 appear to be the mid-tier biotech firms and compounding pharmacies. Compounding pharmacies, which thrived during the 2024–2025 shortage era, are seeing their business models evaporate as Lilly’s official vial prices drop to near-parity with compounded versions. Meanwhile, companies like Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) find themselves in a high-stakes waiting game. Amgen’s MariTide, a monthly injectable currently in Phase 3, is being marketed as a convenience play, but it faces a market that may already be saturated by Lilly’s daily pills and low-cost vials by the time it reaches commercialization in 2027.

Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) remains a ""wildcard"" winner. Despite the massive scale of the ""Big Two,"" Viking’s VK2735 has demonstrated clinical efficacy that may exceed Zepbound. In the 2026 market, Viking has become the ultimate acquisition target for a large-cap pharmaceutical company—such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) or Roche (OTC:RHHBY)—desperate to enter the space with a ""best-in-class"" asset to challenge the Lilly-Novo duopoly.

Broad Industry Trends and the ""Oral Revolution""

The shift toward volume reflects a broader trend in the pharmaceutical industry: the ""commoditization of miracles."" As obesity drugs move from niche luxury treatments to standard-of-care primary care medications, the industry is witnessing a shift in regulatory and policy focus. The 2026 Medicare pilot program is a watershed moment, suggesting that the U.S. government now views obesity treatment as a long-term cost-saving measure for the healthcare system rather than a discretionary expense. This sets a historical precedent similar to the rollout of statins in the 1990s, where high-volume, lower-margin distribution eventually led to massive cumulative profits and improved public health outcomes.

Furthermore, the ""oral revolution"" led by orforglipron and oral Wegovy is removing the final barrier to mass adoption: the ""needle phobia"" factor. By mid-2026, it is expected that nearly 40% of new obesity starts will be for oral medications. This transition is forcing a massive reconfiguration of the pharmaceutical supply chain, moving away from specialized cold-chain logistics required for biologics and toward the traditional pill-and-bottle distribution that has dominated the industry for a century. This shift also has significant ripple effects on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who are being pressured by both Lilly and the government to pass through more of the volume-based discounts directly to consumers.

The Road Ahead: From 2026 to the ""Triple G"" Era

Looking toward the second half of 2026 and into 2027, the market is bracing for the next technological leap. While orforglipron and Zepbound drive volume today, Lilly is already preparing the ground for Retatrutide, its ""Triple G"" agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon). Phase 3 results for Retatrutide are expected to trickle out throughout 2026, potentially setting a new ceiling for weight loss at 25% or higher. The challenge for Lilly will be managing its own internal competition: ensuring that Retatrutide can be positioned as a premium ""high-efficacy"" tier while orforglipron handles the mass-market ""maintenance"" tier.

In the short term, the market will be hyper-focused on the Q1 and Q2 2026 earnings reports to see if the ""volume-led"" strategy is actually translating into bottom-line growth. There is a risk that the aggressive price cuts through LillyDirect and the low-cost Medicare deals could temporarily suppress margins before the full effect of the manufacturing scale-up kicks in. Investors will also be watching for any potential ""rebound effect"" data—long-term studies on what happens when patients transition from injectables to orforglipron pills—as this will determine the sustainability of Lilly’s ""lifelong patient"" model.

Summary and Investor Outlook

Eli Lilly’s 2026 strategy represents a bold bet on the industrialization of weight loss. By pivoting from a model of high-priced scarcity to one of high-volume accessibility, the company is attempting to build an insurmountable lead in the most lucrative therapeutic area in medical history. The combination of a $1 trillion valuation, a massive manufacturing ""moat,"" and a looming oral drug launch positions Lilly as the definitive leader of the obesity market.

For investors, the coming months are critical. The key metrics to watch are not just ""total revenue,"" but ""total prescriptions (TRx)"" and ""manufacturing yield."" If Lilly can successfully transition millions of patients to its oral platform while maintaining its 70%+ share of the injectable market, the $1 trillion market cap may only be the beginning. However, the ongoing price war with Novo Nordisk and the clinical progress of high-efficacy challengers like Viking Therapeutics ensure that while Lilly is currently the king of the mountain, the terrain remains as volatile as ever.

The blue-chip Dow advanced 484.90 points, or 0.99%, likewise reaching an intraday all-time high and closing at a record of 49,462.08. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.65% and ended at 23,547.17.

""Magnificent Seven"" member Amazon lifted the three major averages, rising more than 3%. Other stocks related to artificial intelligence also supported the broader market, including Micron Technology and Palantir Technologies . Micron advanced around 10%, while Palantir climbed more than 3%.

It's only the third trading day of the new year, and semiconductor stocks have already been on a tear, with Micron being one of the leaders. With Tuesday's gains, the stock has risen more than 20% year to date. That's coming off of a blockbuster year for the name, as it soared more than 240% in 2025.

""Tech kind of took a pause at the back end of the year, but I don't think anyone questions that AI is a game changing technology,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. ""We're seeing the chip stocks lead. That's probably to be expected, but that cyclical rotation is still continuing.""

""You can have the AI trade and tech stocks work and the other cyclical components of the market work as well,"" he continued. ""That's the kind of thing you might expect in an economy that is going to be running hot in 2026 with rate cuts, tons of fiscal stimulus and an AI enthusiasm that's getting closer and closer to a fever pitch.""

The 30-stock benchmark closed at a record on Monday and notched an intraday high in the session after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro over the weekend, while President Donald Trump encouraged big investments from U.S. oil companies.

Energy stocks rose broadly on Monday, with the S&P 500 energy sector posting its best one-day gain since July.

Mayfield pointed out that one factor behind why the developments between the U.S. and Venezuela aren't affecting the market is because of the Latin American country's role in the global economy — and the oil market more specifically.

""It's minimal enough that you're not going to see a Ukraine-Russia style response. A big reason for that sell-off was the huge spike in oil prices. We're just not seeing that here and, if anything, I think the market is slightly pricing in the potential for more supply down the road if some of those sanctioned barrels come back onto the market,"" he said.

Home Depot Lastly, Home Depot could become a key part of the work to protect pollinators.","Across the country, bees and other pollinators are struggling. There are three major corporations that have the power to protect them.

Toxic pesticides, habitat loss and industrial farming practices have all contributed to steep die-offs among the insects that help everything from our backyard gardens to major crop harvests bloom.

And while some states are starting to limit the use of neonicotinoids — some of the most harmful pesticides for bees — millions of pounds of these chemicals are still widely available, and end up entering our environment every year.

That’s why Environment America and our national network are working to change the way major companies sell, and consumers use, these pesticides to help turn the tide for bees.

Three of America’s leading companies can make a big difference for bees.

1. Walmart

As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart can make a big difference by phasing out neonics. Neonics attack the brains and bodies of bees and other insects, weakening them and making it more difficult for them to fly, navigate and gather food.

Walmart’s stores are located in nearly every corner of the nation, making the company an influential factor in what pesticides end up on shelves and in gardens. This year, thousands of our members and supporters raised their voices and urged the company to take the next step in phasing out neonics and promoting pollinator-safe alternatives.

We’re keeping up the momentum next year, continuing to call on Walmart to take steps to protect bees.

2. Amazon

Similarly, we’re urging Amazon, the nation’s biggest online marketplace, to stop selling neonic-containing products. With so many shoppers across the nation relying on Amazon for garden supplies, getting these harmful products off Amazon’s websites would likely meaningfully reduce the everyday use of neonics.

3. Home Depot

Lastly, Home Depot could become a key part of the work to protect pollinators. As one of the country’s largest home and garden retailers, the company plays a massive role in what products Americans bring back to their gardens, lawns and flower beds.

Yet despite their negative impact, neonic products can still be found on Home Depot’s shelves. This fall, our supporters added their names to petitions calling on the company to stop neonic sales, all while helping build support and attention around the need for safer, bee-friendly alternatives.

We’re making progress for the bees

As word continues to spread about the dangers and potential impact neonics are having on our pollinators and ecosystems, these companies can follow the lead of states that already are taking action.

Massachusetts, New York, California, Minnesota and others are beginning to restrict the use and sale of neonic pesticides. Meanwhile two states, New York and Vermont have restricted the use of neonic-coated seeds, which are currently used on about 70-80% of all U.S. grown corn, soy and cotton.

But we have to keep calling on influential companies to do the right thing, too. That’s where you come in.

You can help defend bees from dangerous pesticides

From getting neonics off store shelves, to campaigning for stronger regulations on farm and state land, we’re doing everything we can to protect our struggling bees and butterflies.

It’s your dedication that powers every bit of this work. Together, our government, corporate leaders and citizens like you can make America’s gardens, farms and wild places safer for bees and the countless other species that depend on them.

We need your support to urge corporations like Walmart, Amazon and Home Depot to stop selling bee-killing neonic pesticides.

North America’s leading online retailers changed up varying aspects of their executive leadership teams, many of them bringing in new CEOs or hiring technology leaders to navigate an artificial intelligence (AI)-dominated retail environment in 2025.

In the online marketplace arena, eBay brought in a new chief financial officer. It brought in Peggy Alford, who is a board member at Meta and was previously executive vice president of global sales and merchant services for PayPal. Meanwhile, Etsy’s chief technology officer, Rafe Colburn, took on an expanded role. As a result, he became Etsy’s chief product and technology officer. The change came as Etsy’s previous chief product officer departed and the online marketplace consolidated the two executive roles.

Elsewhere, BigCommerce (now simply called Commerce), which powers ecommerce platforms for some of the Top 2000 online retailers, named a new product officer. DHL Supply Chain named a new CEO for its North America unit, and FedEx brought in a new chief digital and information officer (CDIO).

These changes and more highlight varying priorities in a retail macroenvironment that includes:

Shifts in consumer spending as a result of tariffs and other price increases.

AI’s expansion into agentic commerce and other year-defining ecommerce trends.

The rise of retail media networks as key marketing tools.

Mergers and acquisitions, as well as bankruptcies.

Agilent Technologies, a company specializing in life sciences tools, saw its stock price rise by 2.8% during the afternoon trading session. This uptick followed an upgrade from Evercore ISI, which shifted its rating on Agilent from 'In-Line' to 'Outperform' and increased its price target for the stock.

Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar raised Agilent’s price target to $160.00, up from the previous $155.00, reflecting a more optimistic outlook for the company’s future. This positive reassessment comes on the heels of several favorable ratings from other financial institutions, signaling growing confidence in Agilent’s trajectory and strengthening market sentiment.

After the initial surge, Agilent’s shares settled at $147.85, marking a 3.4% gain compared to the previous closing price.

Curious if this is a good moment to invest in Agilent?

Market Reaction and Historical Context

Agilent’s stock typically experiences limited volatility, with only nine instances of price swings greater than 5% over the past year. Today’s movement suggests that investors view the recent news as significant, even if it may not fundamentally alter perceptions of the business.

One of the most notable price increases in the last year occurred eight months ago, when Agilent’s shares climbed 7.8%. This rally coincided with major U.S. indices rising (Nasdaq up 3.4%, S&P 500 up 2.5%) after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily pause certain tariffs for 90 days, hinting at a possible easing of trade tensions.

This agreement reduced U.S. tariffs on Chinese products to 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 10%, providing companies with some relief to adjust inventories and supply chains. However, President Trump warned that tariffs could increase further if a comprehensive deal wasn’t reached within the 90-day window, though not to previous highs. The truce helped calm fears of a prolonged trade conflict, supporting global growth expectations and boosting optimism, especially in sectors sensitive to trade such as technology, retail, and industrials.

Since the start of the year, Agilent’s stock has gained 7.2%. At $147.85 per share, it is trading near its 52-week peak of $157.20, reached in November 2025. For perspective, an investor who purchased $1,000 worth of Agilent shares five years ago would now see that investment grow to $1,203.

By Scott Hamilton

Jan. 6, 2026, © Leeham News: Airbus is tweaking the marketing messaging for the A220 to boost sales for regional airline operations.

Marketing for the A220 began as the C Series when Bombardier launched the program in 2008. Bombardier positioned the 100-seat CS100 as a replacement for the Airbus A318 and Boeing 737-500/600. The 130-seat CS300 was designed to replace the Airbus A319 and Boeing 737-700. The Airbus and Boeing airplanes are considered mainline aircraft as opposed to regional airliners.

Bombardier also design a larger CS500, but didn’t launch the program. The CS500 would be a direct competitor to the A320 and 737-800/8.

Airbus continued this marketing approach when it agreed to purchase control of the C Series program in 2017, renaming it the A220-100 and A220-300. Airbus says it’s a matter of when, not if, it will proceed with the A220-500.

However, at an event hosted by the European Regional Airlines Association, Airbus told regional carriers the A220 is a choice airplane for them if they have ambitions to spread their wings, so to speak.

Benjamin Peiron, VP Single Aisle Marketing for Airbus, told LNA in an interview last month that this message didn’t represent a shift in marketing strategy. “It's more focused, I would say. If we look at the operator base of A220, it's about half composed of legacy carriers, [like] Air France, Delta, Air Canada. About one third is from so-called regional airlines, whatever the exact definition is. The rest is hybrid low-cost or equivalent.”",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LNA-Outlook-2026.png,N,,2026-01-06 20:00:49.388365

On Tuesday, William Blair raised its rating on Medtronic Plc (NYSE: MDT), pointing to a series of recent and upcoming product launches as key factors behind the decision.

The firm shifted its outlook from Market Perform to Outperform. Analyst Brandon Vazquez explained that the previous rating was based on Medtronic’s significant size and lack of distinctiveness, which made it difficult for the company to consistently achieve robust, high single-digit earnings growth.

Medtronic is actively introducing several innovative products, with a strong pipeline suggesting more launches on the horizon.

Medtronic’s Strategic Shift: Signs of a New Era

Should Medtronic succeed in reaching high single-digit EPS growth, the company could potentially offer shareholders a low double-digit return, especially when factoring in its 2.9% dividend yield.

Related: FDA Identifies Medtronic Heart Catheter Recall as Major Safety Concern

According to Vazquez, “With shares trading at about 16 times projected 2026 earnings, Medtronic is valued at or slightly below its large-cap medical technology peers, presenting an attractive risk/reward profile as the company’s outlook improves.”

The Hugo robotic system, which has been anticipated for nearly ten years, recently received FDA clearance for urologic surgeries in the U.S., marking a significant milestone with a clearer timeline for rollout.

This development could mark a pivotal moment for Medtronic’s surgical division, which contributed 19% of the company’s 2025 revenue but has trailed overall corporate growth over the past five years.

William Blair also noted that the Symplicity Spyral RDN system achieved a crucial commercialization milestone in late 2025, following final CMS national coverage approval. Management views this decision as more favorable than the initial draft, ensuring broader patient access.

While revenue growth is expected to be gradual due to the complex clinical landscape, the CMS reimbursement enhances visibility and positions the RDN system to start making a meaningful financial impact.

Why Medtronic Stands Out for Investors

Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) continues to be one of Medtronic’s most rapidly expanding segments, helping to offset slower progress in traditional pacing and defibrillation markets.

The PFA platform bolsters Medtronic’s standing in the atrial fibrillation space by stabilizing market share, opening opportunities for incremental gains, and increasing exposure to the growing AF ablation market as adoption accelerates. This expansion also offers the potential for improved profit margins as volumes rise.

Vazquez commented, “The planned diabetes business spin-off is a win for both entities—MiniMed can focus on becoming a leader in diabetes care, while Medtronic can channel resources into its primary growth areas.”

MDT Stock Performance: At the time of reporting on Tuesday, Medtronic shares had climbed 2.91% to $98.05.

Previously, Alcon and Staar were major competitors in the eyecare space, both specializing in the manufacturing of vision-related medical devices.
Under new terms, Alcon has also lowered promised payouts for Staar executives if the deal closes.

STAAR now has a renewed opportunity to truly shine.” Now that the deal seems likely to fall through, analysts are left asking what comes next for Staar.","Shareholders of Staar Surgical, a manufacturer of the Implantable Collamer Lens, have likely definitively voted against Alcon’s $1.6 billion buyout offer.

Broadwood Partners, which holds 30.2% of Staar’s common shares, has been vocally opposed to the deal since it first became public in October, arguing that the deal would have undervalued the business and reflected a flawed sales process.

The final vote was held on January 6, after having been originally scheduled for October and moved four times since.

Originally, Alcon and Staar’s boards of directors both unanimously supported the transaction, but Staar sent several appeals to its board cautioning against the deal.

Previously, Alcon and Staar were major competitors in the eyecare space, both specializing in the manufacturing of vision-related medical devices.

In December, Alcon upped its bid from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with the new offer valuing the company’s worth at $30.75 per share in cash, as opposed to the previous $28 per share. Under new terms, Alcon has also lowered promised payouts for Staar executives if the deal closes.

“This best and final offer to the Staar stockholders offers a clear choice: a substantial and certain premium versus an uncertain future,” Alcon said in a prepared statement.

Prior to the acquisition, Staar was having a difficult year financially. In May, the company withdrew its 2025 guidance that was announced in February, citing global economic uncertainty and tariff policy conditions.

Staar reported net sales of $42.6 million for 1Q25 compared to $77.4 million in the prior year quarter, pointing to a significant decline in China revenue.

BTIG analysts have recommended that Staar take the new, $1.6 billion offer, writing that the company’s “shares are likely to meaningfully suffer if the deal is not consummated.” On the day of the $1.6 billion offer announcement, Staar shares rose 13.7%.

In October, Staar was able to participate in a “go-shop” period, in which the company allegedly met with 21 other parties but did not receive a single offer.

On December 12, Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC, a leading independent proxy advisory firm, reaffirmed its recommendation that shareholders of Staar should vote “AGAINST” the proposed acquisition by Alcon.

December 17, Broadwood wrote a letter to the board, appealing to its members to vote against the acquisition.

“Since the announcement of STAAR’s proposed sale to Alcon in August, we have been engaged in a spirited debate with you over the Company’s prospects and the merits of the proposed deal. As you know, we have felt from the start that this transaction materially undervalues STAAR and was the product of a deeply flawed process undertaken at the wrong time in STAAR’s history,” the investment firm wrote in a prepared statement.

“As we approach the thrice-delayed special meeting of shareholders, we are confident our fellow shareholders will agree with us and reject this ill-advised transaction. Several large shareholders, all three proxy advisory firms and at least one of the Company’s own directors have rightly expressed great skepticism about the process, timing and price of the proposed deal.”

Based on preliminary results, this deal will not go through; something that Neal C. Bradsher, Broadwood Founder and President, is thanking the board for publicly.

“We thank our fellow shareholders for their attention during this process and for rejecting the proposed acquisition of STAAR by Alcon at today’s Special Meeting. We appreciate that so many shareholders recognize the value of STAAR and share our enthusiasm for the Company’s bright future,” Bradsher said in a prepared statement following the vote.

“It is now time to focus on the road ahead. With its leading technology, strong financial position, privileged position in large markets, and clear path to growth and profit margin expansion in both the near term and the long term, STAAR’s future is bright. As STAAR’s largest shareholder, we are confident in the Company’s standalone prospects and committed to helping STAAR realize its abundant potential for the benefit of all shareholders.

To that end, we are ready and willing to work collaboratively with the Board and our fellow shareholders to implement the necessary changes to enable effective oversight and execution on STAAR’s opportunity to become a highly profitable and scaled enterprise. STAAR now has a renewed opportunity to truly shine.”

Now that the deal seems likely to fall through, analysts are left asking what comes next for Staar. Investors have signaled their intention to fight for changes to the Board and management, which analysts with BTIG believe is likely to happen.

However, analysts also believe this will hamper Staar’s ability to operate for a period of time, as it will serve as a distraction.

“Our STAA Rating is Neutral. With shareholders voting against the acquisition by Alcon (ALC, Buy, $91 PT) we believe shares are likely to remain pressured as changes to the Board and management ensue over the coming weeks and months. As a result, we see limited multiple expansion with shares trading at 2.5x NTM EV/Sales,” BTIG wrote in its report.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blt19a657701cf7cc9a/695d681a8658fd63fd079fc1/alcon_to_use.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 18:01:09.045460

Market update : The S & P 500 is higher for the third straight session and on track to close at a record high. 2026 is off to a fast start, and the gains thus far have been broader than last year, when the AI-crazed concentrated gains in the Magnificent 7, technology, and data center, power-generating industrials. In fact, many stocks that were out of favor over the last few months of 2025 are finally catching up to the rest of the market. Some examples in the portfolio include Amazon , Costco , Eaton , Honeywell , Starbucks , Qnity Electronics , and Texas Roadhouse . Virtually nothing has changed at these companies over the past six days, so we'll see how far this rotation takes them. But we always say there's value in out-of-favor stocks when the fundamentals are positive, and sentiment is too negative. Also, one thing working in their favor is the end of the tax loss selling season, which may have kept a lid on these past underperformers. Good news for Lilly? A biotech company announced interim results from two Phase 1/2a clinical trials on Tuesday that could potentially offer a new approach to treating obesity. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals announced that its investigational RNA interference therapeutic, in combination with Eli Lilly 's tirzepatide, doubled weight loss, improved fat reduction, and increased lean muscle tissue. This was a small sample size, so we shouldn't get too excited about this just yet, but analysts at Truist said the results are ""incrementally positive"" for Lilly, as any future commercialization of Arrowhead's drugs could increase tirzepatide sales. In addition, Truist points out that these medications wouldn't directly compete with Lilly's oral GLP-1 orforglipron, which is expected to launch in the United States sometime in the next few months. For what it's worth, Lilly is running trials of its drug, bimagrumab, which could also provide muscle-preserving benefits. Up next : There are no major earnings after the closing bell or before the opening bell on Wednesday.

William Blair upgraded from Market Perform to Outperform. Analyst Brandon Vazquez wrote that the Market Perform rating hinged on a business that was too large and not differentiated enough to durably hit its goals of delivering consistent high-single-digit EPS growth.

Medtronic is ramping up several new products, with many more in the pipeline.

Medtronic's Transformation: A Turning Point Ahead

If Medtronic is truly positioned for high-single-digit EPS growth, then the company can deliver low-double-digit equity return when factoring in a 2.9% dividend yield.

""At a valuation of roughly 16 times calendar 2026 EPS, the stock is trading in line to slightly below large-cap medtech peers, suggesting a favorable risk/reward for an improving setup,"" Vazquez added.

The Hugo system has been long-awaited for almost a decade now and has a more tangible timeline, recently announcing FDA approval for urologic surgical procedures in the U.S.

The update could be an inflection point in the company's surgical segment, which accounted for 19% of revenues in 2025 and has been growing slower than the corporate average over the past five years.

William Blair highlighted that the Symplicity Spyral RDN system reached a major commercialization inflection in late 2025 with final CMS national coverage. Management considers the decision more favorable than the draft and adequate to support broad patient access.

Investors should expect a measured revenue ramp, reflecting a long but nuanced clinical evidence base. Even so, CMS reimbursement meaningfully improves visibility and positions RDN to begin contributing to the P&L.

Why Investors Should Bet On Medtronic Now

Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) remains one of Medtronic's fastest-growing businesses and a key counterbalance to slower growth in legacy pacing and defibrillation markets.

The PFA platform strengthens Medtronic's competitive position in atrial fibrillation by supporting share stabilization with potential for modest gains, increasing exposure to a large and expanding AF ablation market as adoption rises, and offering a clear margin upside as volumes scale.

""We view the diabetes spin-off as compelling for both parties, allowing the newly formed MiniMed to focus on becoming a staple in the diabetes market and Medtronic to allocate resources toward the aforementioned growth drivers,"" analyst Vazquez wrote in an investor note on Tuesday.

MDT Price Action: Medtronic shares were up 2.91% at $98.05 at the time of publication on Tuesday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

BRIAN KENNY: Das, you studied a lot of different firms and different industries.
MARK PEARSON: We are a long cycle, decades-long business, so we have to honor the past and Equitable has much to do.
MARK PEARSON: I think the best story we can probably tell is with our teachers’ business.
MARK PEARSON: We have all the tools available for people to actually learn and play in the sandbox, if you like.","BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. It’s early 2025 and inside Equitable Holdings, CEO Mark Pearson is asking a simple but profound question: is 80% enough? Over the past three years, the company has undergone a sweeping transformation and launched a bold experiment to reinvent how a 160-year-old financial institution collaborates, innovates, and leads. This New Way of Working is designed to speed up decision-making, empower teams, and ignite a new culture of agility. But not everyone is on board. Some divisions thrive under the new model while others cling to old habits.

As Pearson and his leadership team look ahead, they face a defining choice whether to push for total adoption or allow flexibility at the edges. This case challenges us to consider what true cultural change looks like and what it takes to make it last. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Das Narayandas and guests Mark Pearson and Jeff Hurd to discuss the case, “New WOW at Equitable, A New Way of Working.”

I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR podcast network.

Das Narayandas’ research focuses on business-to-business marketing and management of client relationships and professional service firms. Das, it’s been a while since we’ve had you on Cold Call. Welcome back.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Thank you.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. We’re really excited to have two guests in the studio today. In addition to Das, we’ve got Mark Pearson, he’s the president and CEO of Equitable Holdings. He’s joined today by Jeff Hurd, Chief Operating Officer. Both of you have lived the case so thank you for being here to talk about it with us.

JEFF HURD: We’re really happy to be here.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you very much, Brian.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s been a busy day for you, right? You came in from the classroom and you’re coming in here, so you’ve got some fresh insights as to the discussion that took place there. I think a lot of people will be able to relate to the central themes of this case because every organization is trying to figure out how to get more agile, how to be more innovative, particularly in the age of AI, where these things are coming at us fast and we’ve got to figure out how to grapple with it. And as we all know, change is hard. So, we’re going to talk about that.

Das, I’m going to start with you. Let’s just dive right in. I’m wondering what initially drew you to the case and how this story reflects larger questions about how organizations pursue cultural change, particularly in highly regulated industries, which the Equitable is. We’ll talk a little bit about their business in a moment, but why’d you write the case?

DAS NARAYANDAS: Like you said, Brian, change is hard, change is ugly, and we live in a world where change is something that has to happen all the time. So, how does one go about doing it? The reason I wrote this case is I’ve been thinking about looking at a series of firms in different industries that are trying to overcome inertia and break down barriers to remain relevant.

The metaphor I used in class today when I was teaching this case was my visit to my physician earlier this summer, and he told me that my metabolism was slowing down. I took that as a comment about my aging, but then I realized when I ChatGPT’d after the meeting about metabolism, what I found out was metabolism in human body slows down when the muscle mass decreases, which is part of aging. What my physician was telling me was, Das, if you want to stay alive, go get yourself fit by building some muscle mass. I think that’s really what organizations need to do too. You need to build the muscle to remain relevant. This case that I’ve written is trying to capture how Mark and Jeff as leaders of Equitable took 160-year-old organization and have truly made it relevant in today’s world by making it a five-year-old. They brought in new muscle, and they made existing muscle better. That is the whole idea of change management, and that’s why I wrote this case.

BRIAN KENNY: Five-year-olds can be difficult to manage, though; we know that. It’s a great metaphor.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Let’s say that what they did was build a disciplined five-year-old, if there is one.

BRIAN KENNY: Well, I’ve never met one of those before. Great. Mark, I’m going to turn to you then and ask you, I thought the metabolism thing was actually a really interesting metaphor for what you were doing here. I’m wondering if you take us back to 2018, which was the IPO when the case first kicks off, what did you observe that convinced you that Equitable needed to rethink how it worked?

MARK PEARSON: Well, one of the things with any change management is having a catalyst to change. The IPO really came to us when AXA, our parent at that time, decided that it was going to exit the U.S. market and in turn, we were going to spin off on our own. We were incredibly excited about that. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be the architect of a business rather than somebody who drove the car that somebody else had designed. So very, very excited at that. At the same time, we knew that this organization, 160-year-old, was very high integrity business, a nice business, but a very, very sleepy business. It just wasn’t fit for purpose as a listed company. We knew that we had to do three things really. Firstly, we had to change our risk philosophy, our risk profile, because our balance sheet was a different size to AXA’s.

Secondly, I had to bring in people who had operated in that listed entity world, and Jeff was the first person we hired there. And then thirdly, the way we work the culture, if you like, inside the organization, we had to speed it up. We had to be much more innovative because at the same time as this IPO, we saw those forces you were talking about in the introduction to the podcast, we saw technology coming in, we saw new competitors coming in. We saw new sophisticated ways of investing. So, the convergence of these two really was what made us very determined that we had to change the metabolism to take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Jeff, you kind of lived it. You were one of the people who was helping to drive this change within the firm. We talk a lot at Harvard Business School about design thinking and the importance of agility. Those are abstract concepts though. I think one of the things that’s difficult is how you drive that home in a practical way so people understand what does it take to actually do this in a way that’s going to help our business? How were you able to translate those ideas to the people within the firm?

JEFF HURD: We knew we had to be better, faster, smarter, cheaper, and I think the whole organization recognized that. We had great confidence because of the studying that we had done, the visiting of other companies that these sort of time-tested methodologies were sound, and they needed to be adapted for Equitable; and maybe to use Das’s muscle analogy, we knew that to build muscle, we just had to get going.

This couldn’t stay on a piece of paper and not be implemented. So, we got going and we took our first unit in. We took that unit all the way down to the studs, started talking to them about what their mission is. They create their own mission. We walked them through how to create OKRs, which are a really, really hard thing to do. We help them organize into agile teams and to start to operate in those teams. By doing, we built a real flywheel and momentum, and people could touch and feel and experience what we had put out on a piece of paper.

BRIAN KENNY: By the way, I should have asked at the outset, Mark, maybe you can tell us just quickly the profile of Equitable, how many employees you have and the main lines of business.

MARK PEARSON: Yeah, sure. Equitable, 163 years old, now quoted on New York Stock Exchange, about 15 billion market cap. We serve about five and a half million clients across three main lines of business. Retirement business, wealth management, and asset management is what we do. In total across our two operating companies, we manage about a trillion of clients’ money.

BRIAN KENNY: Das, you studied a lot of different firms and different industries. I’m wondering what made this experiment interesting. I’m thinking particularly about the fact that the industry is highly regulated, so being agile is great, being reckless is not, managing your risk profile, Mark, as you said before, why did you think this was an interesting one to focus on in particular?

DAS NARAYANDAS: I think it goes back to the question you asked earlier, Brian, when you asked Jeff, “Tell us how you got it done.” This is something that we’ve been discussing in the School for a decade now: knowing in itself is not enough. Doing and being is when and how things get crystal clear. This was an example where the concepts that we have heard of for a long time were brought together by a bunch of people. They have no issues by saying that we’ve imported ideas that others had, but what they did, which is their very own, was the mixing. To me, that was a great example that I wanted to bring to the executives that I’m teaching now who are running their own businesses, who are in a fundamental situation of fright or flight when they should actually be thinking of fight. I want to teach this case to give them a better understanding of how to stand their ground and fight, and remain competitive in a world where new competitors are showing up all the time.

BRIAN KENNY: Mark, I think there might’ve been some marketing people involved. I say that as a marketing person because you packaged this up inside the firm, you had a sort of a brand going around this, which is New Way of Working. The acronym is N-W-O-W. Do you actually say “en-WOW?”

MARK PEARSON: Yes, we do.

BRIAN KENNY: Awesome. Maybe you can talk a little bit about NWOW, what comprised it. There were five pillars that are mentioned in the case. If you can briefly describe what those are and how you packaged this in a way that people across the firm could begin to understand what it was you were trying to do.

MARK PEARSON: Thanks, Brian. It’s a package of, as Das said, tried and tested methodologies that worked for us. So, starts off with objectives and key results. I mean, we were very influenced by John Doerr’s book Measure What Matters. Secondly, adaptive leadership. Really empowering our leaders to make the decisions that they need to make in our best place to make. So really an empowerment message in there. Agile working, we had within our IT department, we saw how that worked and so we rolled it out as fast as we could. Then it was clear to us that we needed to have a segment that was dealing with redesign because over the 160 years of the existence of the company, the structures inside of the company look a little bit like a coral reef, they’re not really designed or smooth. Then we had one based around skills as well and really flattened the organization out so that instead of having 26 layers of job title, we went right down to five. So, they were the five main pillars.

BRIAN KENNY: That’s a huge challenge in any organization. Even here at Harvard Business School, we’ve got silos, and it’s always difficult to figure out a way to pull people out of the silos and think about being one team. I think clearly you’ve encountered this as well. Jeff, I’m going to come back to you and ask you what the thinking was behind the way that you designed things and how you were able to break down some of the silos and get people to come up and be part of a bigger community.

JEFF HURD: It goes back to how we implemented these with each of the units that I touched on a little bit before, but we would have a boot camp, and we’d have a group of leaders together in a particular part of the organization. And they had this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to completely redesign their organization, to create new organizational units, to open up a bunch of leadership positions for other people in their organization or elsewhere in the organization. We actually did a thing called the opportunity fairs where the leader of the group would stand up in front of the entire Equitable organization, talk about their mission, talk about why this is the place in Equitable that you want to work, and talk about these actual big leadership job openings. They were open to anybody in the company. The people who acted early in effect got first draft pick. And that built a real flywheel of people now raising their hands saying, “I want to be next, I want to be next.”

That just created excitement in the organization, allowed us to shuffle the leadership, allowed us to find gems. I know Mark and I would go to the readouts and people would be talking about their OKRs or their mission, and we’d look at each other and say, “Who is that person?” Because we would’ve never discovered them in the past, and there they were and said, This person needs a leadership role. So, it really broke a lot of the coral reef that Mark talked about before.

BRIAN KENNY: You’re making it sound easy though, and I’m sure it wasn’t easy. I’m sure there was a fair amount of skepticism as you’ll find in any organization. What was the initial reaction that you were getting from people? Was there pushback and how’d you deal with that?

MARK PEARSON: Absolutely. There’s skepticism on any change program. One of the keys we found was to find the influential skeptics and really turn them. Really takes a lot of work. You have to sit down, you have to explain why you’re doing this. You have to measure the changes that you are making. But once some of those skeptics turn, they become your best ambassadors and they really, really carry a lot of the other people. There’s no doubt although, Brian, that New Ways of Working isn’t for everybody.

The level of accountability in there, standing up every two weeks to say, “What have you done in the last sprint? How are you contributing?” May not be for everybody. So clearly, we did lose some people who weren’t attuned to that way of working. To Jeff’s point earlier, it was very interesting to watch. There became a tipping point where the skeptics then turn, there is some momentum. We see engagement going up, we see results going back. Then other departments were, when is it my turn? We reached a tipping point after a while where you could see people queuing up to get the program and be in the boot camp.

BRIAN KENNY: Das, you probably looked at similar situations in a lot of different places. I’m wondering, as you saw as an outsider looking at what Equitable was doing, how important was it to have this balance of top-down versus bottom-up? Giving people some autonomy and basically some skin in the game, I guess is one way to look at it.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Change only works when it’s both ways, top-down and bottom-up. The key to successful change is figuring out when it should be top-down and when it should be bottom-up. I wrote this case actually to have that very discussion in class, Brian. It’s not one or the other. There are things that leaders need to mandate, and there are things where you need to let people come along on their own with some encouragement, figuring out that magic mix. At the end of the day, this case is about helping managers and leaders figure out how to mix the right concoction. The ingredients are there; everyone has access to it. It’s compounding it together into something that’s a powerful medication that changes the metabolism of organizations. That’s what this case is about.

I just want to add here, the B case that goes with this case actually is the playbook. It is an interactive PDF or PowerPoint that people can use to figure out what those five pillars that you mentioned are, how it works, what the process is, how you get it done. Now, my gut and Kerry Herman, who I wrote this case with, we were discussing and when we were writing this case, we said, Ah, this company is never going to let us publish the playbook. Because that’s the secret sauce. Who would give up the secret sauce? So, he said, Anyway, let’s ask. No harm done in asking. And lo and behold, when we asked the leadership—Jeff, Mark—they say, Sure, take it. You want the functionality, keep it. Then we looked at each other and said, Why are they giving it? They’re not naive. They’re smart. What we realized was their supreme confidence in how they have done it, that they are happy for others to replicate. I’m not giving away the crown jewels in the case. I’m actually making it more interesting for people to go figure out the case because, what is it that these people do? What is this NWOW that they are so openly discussing that I can learn from and use? That’s what we’re going to be learning from doing this case in class.

BRIAN KENNY: I would imagine that telling people what you did and explaining to them how they could do it isn’t a guarantee that they’re going to be able to pull off what you pulled off. This takes a lot of work, a lot of attention to detail and a lot of bringing the culture along with you. Jeff mentioned that not everybody embraced it. Some people had to be moved out. There’s some cultural damage that happens there. How do you as a leader, Mark, think about making sure the culture doesn’t get irreparably harmed as you do this and you’re trying to bring people forward with you?

MARK PEARSON: It’s a bit of getting the balance right between honoring the past and also making sure that the company is going to be around in the future. It’s especially important for an insurance group like ours where just last year, Brian, we paid out on a policy that was taken out in 1931.

BRIAN KENNY: Oh, my goodness.

MARK PEARSON: We are a long cycle, decades-long business, so we have to honor the past and Equitable has much to do. So, we were… I don’t know, just off the top of my head, we’ve ensured 10 U.S. presidents. We were amongst the first to pay out to servicemen and servicewomen in World War II. We were there through the Depression. A very fine and honorable past, but we have to make sure that we not only survive, but thrive in the future because the promises we’re making today, we will have to pay out on decades to come. I don’t have a problem with honoring the past, but also changing for the future. And the culture really, really did need to change.

It’s interesting, Brian, if you look at the management team now, Jeff and I didn’t set out to do this, but it’s almost exactly one third of people who joined new since NWOW, one third of some of the younger people have been promoted up rapidly through NWOW, and about one third have been throughout the whole journey. So, it’s quite interesting we’ve got that mix, which I think enables us to honor that past and keep the bits of the culture that we want and also change so that we can be competitive and stay around for decades to come.

BRIAN KENNY: You’re talking about the decades-long relationship you have with your customers, which is, we haven’t talked about the customers here. Have you told them what you’re doing? How have they reacted to it if you have? Are they in favor of this or are they, oh, don’t mess with my insurance?

MARK PEARSON: I think the best story we can probably tell is with our teachers’ business. We’re very proud to serve a million educators in the U.S. We’re number one in the K-12.

BRIAN KENNY: My wife thanks you; she’s an educator.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you. You’ll know through your wife, Brian, that COVID time, everything shut on the schools. We had the worksite marketing model where our advisors would go into the school, sit on those little chairs, get a yellow pad out and help the teacher with their retirement planning. That of course, all came to a shuddering halt, and we had to dramatically change how we interacted with them. We had to go from face-to-face to digital, which Jeff and I reckon would’ve taken years and years to do if we’d have sat down and wrote out a project. But the fact that we were able to use NWOW to sit down and say, Look, we need to contact our clients here.

The most important thing for us during COVID was to pay out claims and retirement checks when our clients needed them. If you can’t get that claim or retirement check from an insurance company when a disaster has hit, why do you need an insurance company? It actually came together very, very well there. That would be an example where our clients were informed. I guess, Das in his teaching earlier on was saying, sometimes in change programs you need a little bit of luck. We totally agree with that one. We were a little bit lucky there during COVID that teachers were trying to figure out with their students how to connect. So, we fed into that debate and we were saying, hey, we want to connect with you as well. And they were open to it.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s another where we’ve heard so many silver linings that came out of that horrible situation where businesses—

MARK PEARSON: Accelerators…

BRIAN KENNY: …found new ways to do things and really spur growth. Jeff, I want to come back to you. Most firms I think I can safely say would have hired consultants to do this. They would’ve paid a lot of money to outside firms to come in and help them do it, but you chose to do it differently. I’m wondering why you made that trade-off and what you see as the benefits or drawbacks from doing that.

JEFF HURD: One of the great attributes of this leadership team, I’d say, Brian, is that they’re learning machines. We had benefited so much from reading John Doerr, reading Turn the Ship Around, visiting companies like Spark, which is a telecom company in New Zealand that adopted Agile for Grownups, visiting other companies. We did work with a consulting firm at the beginning and took a lot of knowledge from them. They helped us to figure out how to stand up the organization in the right way. We probably worked with them for about six months. But we knew that if you’re not going to get that eye roll from the organization, it has to be done with your people, you have to own it.

Really, the CEO has to own it and say, “This is ours.” So, we took one of our top talents, Hilary Menard, who used to be Mark’s chief of staff, and we said, You’re in charge of this innovation and design office. You figure out how to implement this. You tell us what resources you need to do that. And you decide whether you need consultants or not. That was a form of adaptive leadership where we didn’t tell her what to do. She decided we needed to make this our own. And she built an outstanding team to implement it.

MARK PEARSON: Brian, I think when you have change programs that are driven by consultants over the years, operating managers have learned that sooner or later the consultants will go and we can get back to normal.

BRIAN KENNY: The book goes on the shelf.

MARK PEARSON: Yeah. I think it is very important if change is going to be enduring that it is yours. Sure, use consultants to train the trainer if you like, and lift your skills up. But many, many managers who maybe don’t want to change will just simply outweigh the consultants.

BRIAN KENNY: Actually, on that point, Das, I want to come back to you for a minute because this all began at a moment of inflection for the firm. The IPO gave them the platform and the burning platform that you described before, Mark. How do you sustain that once the fire is out? Once the burning is gone, and that the firm’s doing well, do people just fall back into a mode where they kind of wait it out a little bit?

DAS NARAYANDAS: Well, that’s what you’ll learn when you discuss the case in class. I will answer your question, but I just want to reflect on something that Mark said earlier. In the spirit of continuous improvement and agile development, when we wrote the current version of the case, we consciously chose not to include a case fact that the current organization is one-third the old, one-third laterals in, and one-third coming up. We thought that that would be a good “aha” to pull out in class. But having taught the case a couple of times today, we are going to put that into the case

Mark and Jeff spent quite some time with the participants talking about what it takes to make this happen. So, yes, what do you do going ahead? is a good question, and I’ll answer that in a moment, but how do you make sure that it works in the short run? What do you do with naysayers? Skeptics can be converted, but there are cynics too. Being cynical is irrational. It’s not easy to convert that. How do you manage that? So, the case, when putting this fact in, I will be able to force students to address this question of, how do you manage those that don’t want to get on board? That’s really the question that we’re going to start with in this case discussion: is 80% good enough, or do you need to get to 100%? And how do you manage it?

I’m now answering your question: What the team has shown and what will be a C case, which you’re going to put together, is the fact that the pillars are evolving. There are existing pillars that are evolving to reflect current times. There are new pillars being added, and that’s how it remains current. That’s how it remains exciting. That’s what makes it effective for people to adopt. Great brands are consistent. They take the core promise, but they make it work in today’s world. The day this team stops innovating New Ways of Working is the day it becomes history. For now, I can tell you they’re very agile in making sure that the latest issues, the externalities in the world, are constantly being reflected in how this system is being deployed.

BRIAN KENNY: I love your answer because you started out by… Our listeners are hearing about new HBS case studies all the time, and part of the reason we do this podcast is to show people how relevant the case studies are to everyday business practice. And you just showed us that you’re innovating on the case even as you go because learning in the classroom and feeding that back into the case. So that’s a really great point.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Thank you.

BRIAN KENNY: Jeff, I wanted to ask you something about what Das just said, which is that you’ve got to keep changing the model to keep it fresh. From your vantage point, how do you know when it’s time to change something up? Are you getting a feedback loop from within the firm?

JEFF HURD: 100%. Maybe I’ll answer that in two ways. One is within each unit they’ve implemented New Ways of Working slightly differently. The core concepts are 100% adoption. We had that conversation in class, but exactly how it’s applied has to be modified a bit with the right mindset for the organization. The service center is different than the sales team is different than the product team. So, we see innovation on NWOW every time we stand up a new organization. And then what we’ve learned recently, we added another pillar called “process redesign,” and Mark talked about this coral reef that builds up after 160 years. We were hearing, because of adaptive leadership, from all sorts of different parts of our organization that this process is broken, this process isn’t working, and they actually knew how to fix it. So, we developed a methodology, or adopted a methodology, tried and true process re-engineering to go in, listened to the folks who are actually doing the process, map it out, apply digital technologies to it, and totally revamp those processes. That’s a new wedge in the NWOW wheel that we’ve added probably about six months ago.

BRIAN KENNY: So, you’ve had some time to see what the results are. I’m wondering, reflecting back, if you can tell us how do you think it’s going? What would you be looking at to call this a success three, four, five years from now?

MARK PEARSON: Looking forward, I think the one thing we can be certain of is the amount of opportunities for change that we will see will not slow down, looking at Gen AI obviously, changes in the workforce. For our business, Brian, the demographics are very, very favorable in terms of the number of Americans reaching a traditional retirement age of 65 is yet to peak. But also, we know, I think that there are some enduring principles as well. I guess looking out the things that don’t change are as important for us as how we work and what doesn’t go. I think we see Equitable as being a trusted partner. We also know that it’s a very competitive market, and we need to be relentless in our innovation, and we need to continue with NWOW to be very, very client focused on that side as well. In our business we need to have a very resilient balance sheet because we need to be around for many, many decades through ups and downs and economy. So, we see NWOW continuing to evolve, and we see a bright future, I think, for our industry and certainly for the company as long as our people remain focused on the client and focused on being a trusted advisor to that client.

BRIAN KENNY: Jeff, let me ask you, as somebody who was helping boots on the ground to lead this effort across the firm, I’m sure some of the folks that are listening to this podcast might be going through a similar kind of transformation at their own firm. Do you have any words of advice, words of caution, anything you would counsel them on?

JEFF HURD: I’d say the one thing I would emphasize is if you’re going to go through a change that’s this big and this transformational, remember that organizations don’t change, people change. So, you really have to show people what’s in it for them: How will I benefit from this change? How will I work better? Mark had a brilliant phrase that he used all the time when we talked to our organization, which is, We’re future proofing you. These are skills that you are learning. We hope you apply them at Equitable. If you pick up and go somewhere else, they’re going to stay with you for the rest of your life. There are great tools to have in your career. Actually, we found, Mark, this was probably most surprising to us, that people were applying these things like OKRs, adaptive leadership, design, thinking to their own lives outside of work.

BRIAN KENNY: Sure. I could see that.

JEFF HURD: So, if you show people what’s in it for them, they actually will change.

BRIAN KENNY: This is a question. I lied. I’m asking each of you another question. As you think about the impact of AI on your business, Mark, because you mentioned it, how are you thinking about bringing people up the learning curve on that, upskilling your own community on what AI means and how they should engage with it?

MARK PEARSON: We have all the tools available for people to actually learn and play in the sandbox, if you like. I think we’ve got something like 400 case studies we’ve looked at. I would say mainly on the productivity side at the moment. I think the next stage for us is to look at ways in which we can get out into the marketplace and make it real for us. So very excited about the opportunities that it will bring, and we are in that sort of learning and productivity improvement stage.

BRIAN KENNY: I think we’re all in that phase and trying to figure out how do we wrap our arms around it. Das, I’ve got one last question, and I’ll give this to you, which is that as you think about culture change at an organization, particularly one of this size and scale, the question that the case brings up, is 80% good enough? How do you think about that? How would you counsel a leader who’s trying to think about should they push hard for that 100% adoption, or should they be a little more flexible in that?

DAS NARAYANDAS: My answer that I gave you earlier is come to class and we will discuss. No, the reason why we have that question in the case is it’s real, but it’s also illusionary. Numbers matter, but numbers don’t finalize things. The idea of asking is 80% good enough is actually asking the question, what is good enough? When you say 100%, 100% of what? Focus not on the numbers, but focus on the effectiveness of what you get done and that will lead you to the right answer. The key here is the orientation of people. As long as you can bring people on board and they give it their best, you are on the right path. The problem is when people who get on board sit the wrong way, row in the wrong direction and don’t listen to you, having all 100% of them sitting in the boat is disastrous. That’s really what we spend 80 minutes debating or 90 minutes debating in this case as to, what does it take to create a winning organization?

BRIAN KENNY: Those are great words to end on. Das, Jeff, Mark, thanks for joining me.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much.

Robotics company Nuro is leading testing of the robotaxi engineering prototypes, which are overseen by autonomous vehicle operators. Commercial service is expected to launch in the San Francisco Bay Area later in 2026.

The companies made the announcement at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show this week, also showcasing the in-cabin experience for riders. The robotaxis will have in-vehicle visualization, showing riders the vehicle's path in real-time and displaying what the robotaxi sees. They will also feature LEDs to help riders identify the right vehicles and provide status updates.

“By combining leading expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy and ridehailing, we’re building a unique new option for affordable and scalable autonomous rides in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond,” said Sarfraz Maredia, global head of autonomous mobility and delivery at Uber.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.
Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.","The market expects Delta Air Lines (DAL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.2%.

Revenues are expected to be $15.45 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.94% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Delta?

For Delta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.29%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Delta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Delta would post earnings of $1.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of +12.50%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Delta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

However, you might be surprised to learn you'll also find a variety of this brand's food in restaurants, served in a way you may not be aware of. Restaurants can order these food products from the brand pre-made, frozen, and in bulk sizes, ready for them to prepare and serve.

Kraft Heinz has numerous brand names under its label. In addition to its popular ketchup, which we consider as one of the best Ketchup brands you can buy, it's also known for other grocery store items like mustard, mayonnaise, cream cheese, pickle relish, and more. However, Kraft Heinz also sells restaurant-style, ready-to-heat-and-serve bulk frozen foods, including soup by Heinz, Chef Francisco, Quality Chef, and True Soups; Oscar Meyer hot dogs and sausages; vegetarian Boca burgers, and more. Though many restaurant chains make your food fresh to order, the next time you enjoy a delicious chicken enchilada soup or veggie burger at your favorite restaurant chain, it may actually be a product made by Kraft Heinz.

Henry John Heinz developed the original Heinz company in 1876, and its iconic ketchup hasn't changed much since it was introduced almost 150 years ago. The company's current iteration, Kraft Heinz, was formed with the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Co. It's the fifth largest food company in the world and the third largest in North America. In addition to producing frozen food for restaurants, Kraft Heinz makes Heinz condiments in bulk and in single-serve packets for restaurant customers to use on their favorite foods. The list of Heinz products served in restaurants includes ketchup and mustard, unique BBQ-style and other flavor sauces, dressings for your salad bar, as well as individual packets, Mexican sauces and salsas, and much more.

Though the company has added numerous products to its line over the years, the ketchup you enjoy today is much like the original ketchup made in 1876, as there has been little in the way of recipe adjustments besides using corn syrup instead of sugar. After 150 years, the Heinz ketchup brand is still so popular that Kraft Heinz created a product verification system so you can tell if a restaurant's bottle of ketchup is truly a Heinz product rather than an imposter brand.",https://www.chowhound.com/img/gallery/the-classic-grocery-brand-that-sells-bulk-frozen-products-to-restaurants/l-intro-1767194324.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:13:36.419168

They learn speed from U.S. teams.
Final Thought Leading across Canada and the U.S. means more than crossing a border.","Leadership Gets Tested Across Borders

Running teams in one country is tough. Doing it in two is a whole new game.

When leaders move between Canada and the U.S., they face different markets, mindsets, and systems. What works in one place may fall flat in the other. You can’t copy and paste strategy. You have to think differently.

Cross-border leaders learn fast. They build sharper systems. They speak two business languages. They earn trust in new ways. And they gain an edge most people never get.

Similar, But Not the Same

Canada and the U.S. share a border, a language, and many business traits. But key differences matter.

In Canada, regulation is more centralized. The pace can be slower. Risk tolerance is lower. Relationships matter more before decisions get made.

In the U.S., markets move faster. Sales cycles can be shorter. Risk-taking is more common. Speed often beats perfection.

One country leans on structure. The other leans on scale.

Neither is better. But leaders have to adapt.

Strategy Must Match Culture

The U.S. rewards bold moves. New ideas. Fast pivots. That makes it a good place for testing, launching, and scaling.

Canada values thoughtfulness. Stability. Clear plans. That makes it better for long-term planning and deeper client loyalty.

If you use a U.S. style in Canada, you might sound pushy. If you use a Canadian approach in the U.S., you might lose momentum.

Cross-border leadership means knowing when to turn the dial up or down.

Regulatory Rules Shape Growth

The U.S. has state-by-state rules. Canada runs most financial services through a few big regulators. This changes how products launch and scale.

Licensing, marketing, and reporting look different. Cross-border firms need separate playbooks.

Even the investor base looks different. A 2023 BNY Mellon study showed that U.S. institutional investors allocate more to alternatives (34%) than Canadian investors (22%). That affects how you build models and pitch ideas.

Understand the legal side early. Don’t assume it works the same both ways.

Talent Expectations Vary

In Canada, teams value security, benefits, and work-life balance. In the U.S., there’s more focus on growth, compensation, and upward mobility.

Leadership has to adjust:

Feedback styles

Bonus structures

Flexibility options

Career path messaging

Good leaders know what motivates their people. Great leaders adjust their style by region.

Youssef Zohny, who built his career in both countries, noticed these patterns firsthand. “In Canada, building trust often came before doing business. In the U.S., business could start quicker—but expectations for speed and innovation were also higher.”

That mindset shift shaped how he led teams on both sides of the border.

Communication Needs Local Context

Even if the language is the same, tone and delivery matter.

In the U.S., people value clarity and confidence. In Canada, subtlety and consensus play a bigger role.

Meetings run differently. Emails read differently. Client conversations move at different speeds.

One quick tip: Cut jargon everywhere. Keep language simple. Clear. Direct. But respectful of the local style.

Use feedback loops to adjust. Ask what’s landing—and what isn’t.

Currency and Cost Matter More Than You Think

Cross-border operations come with pricing challenges. Currency shifts can cut into margins. Service costs vary.

For example:

Healthcare is employer-funded in the U.S., public in Canada

Software costs often priced in U.S. dollars

Office space is more expensive in core U.S. cities

Every budget decision must factor in exchange rates and local costs.

Even something simple like setting a salary range can get tricky fast.

Use real-time tools to track FX impact. Forecast for both directions.

Scaling Across Borders Requires Repeatable Systems

To grow across countries, your systems must scale.

Start with these:

Unified onboarding processes

Clear reporting templates

Cross-border tax tracking

Shared cloud-based tools (but with regional backups)

Time zone calendars that avoid overlap errors

Don’t assume your U.S. workflows will work in Toronto or Vancouver. Run test cases. Ask team leads for feedback.

Small process breaks become big delays at scale.

Action Steps for Cross-Border Leaders

1. Build Two Playbooks

Customize one for the U.S. and one for Canada. Include hiring, sales, compliance, and client communication.

2. Run Side-by-Side Tests

Try the same strategy in both markets. Compare the response. Adjust accordingly.

3. Map Time Zones Clearly

Block shared calendar time. Respect regional holidays. Don’t book over them.

4. Use Local Experts

Hire local legal, tax, and HR pros. Even small issues can lead to major slowdowns if missed.

5. Track FX Risk Monthly

Review how currency moves affect margins. Protect with hedging if needed.

6. Lead With Context

When launching new products or initiatives, explain the why and the where. Teams want to know how it fits the market they serve.

Real Leadership Means Learning on Both Sides

The best cross-border leaders don’t just export ideas. They import lessons.

They learn patience from Canadian teams. They learn speed from U.S. teams. They keep both cultures in the conversation.

They avoid one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, they build bridges—between systems, styles, and people.

Those lessons build stronger companies. Teams that work better. Clients who stay longer.

Cross-border leadership isn’t just about growth. It’s about insight.

Final Thought

Leading across Canada and the U.S. means more than crossing a border. It means building new habits, asking smarter questions, and making decisions that fit the map—not just the model.

Focus on what works where you are. Stay open to change. Build with context.

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

And so the cafes can show up as a personification of what is Capital One,"" said Jennifer Windbeck, Capital One's head of retail bank channels.
And really the reason why we opened this coffee is to really help our customer and enhance their shopping experience,"" Cessot said.","From monogrammed lattes at Louis Vuitton to handbag-inspired pastries at Coach , retail stores are increasingly doubling as cafes.

It's all part of companies trying to lean into experiences.

""I've long said that the easiest way to get in the experience business is to add a cafe because it engages all five senses and it gets customers to spend more time with you,"" said Joe Pine, co-author of the Experience Economy.

As the retail landscape evolves post-pandemic, some of the early pioneers in the branded cafe concept are continuing to expand, and new entrants are entering the space.

Uniqlo brought its first coffee bar to the United States in March. It has nine locations worldwide, with the first opening in Japan in 2021.

Uniqlo's head of marketing, Nico Cessot, told CNBC that the primary reason for the cafes is to bring in more customers and enhance their shopping experience.

""The interest behind and the concept behind [it] is to make you feel at home, to be part of the brand, to feel the brand, to also spread the Japanese culture. Because we are a Japanese company,"" Cessot said. He added that New York City's Fifth Avenue store uses coffee beans imported from Japan.

Luxury brands

Recently, cafes have been particularly prevalent with designer brands.

Over the past few years, fashion house LVMH has opened a Dior cafe in Dallas and Louis Vuitton Cafe in New York. It has also remodeled the Tiffany brand's Blue Box Café. All three locations are collaborations with Michelin-starred chefs.

Source: Tiffany & Co.

Prada, which is not a part of LVMH, is also rumored to be opening a New York location in 2026. The luxury retailer opened a cafe in London in 2023 and in Singapore in 2025.

Coach, meanwhile, opened its first cafe in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2024. Since then, it has opened four in the U.S. and over a dozen more internationally.

Marcus Sanders, Coach vice president of global food and beverage, said the company is seeing double to triple digit sales at stores where it added a cafe.

""Ultimately what I see happening is there's this really cool nexus of fashion meets hospitality,"" Sanders said. ""People are excited to be able to experience their favorite brands in a different way.""

The cafe rollout is also an effort by Coach to tap into popularity with Gen Z, Sanders said, which has been the core demographic driving its cultural resurgence. The brand saw a revenue increase of 22% in its fiscal 2026 first quarter.

Standing out

While more brands are adding cafes to their stores, this trend is not a new phenomenon. Barnes and Noble and Target have both partnered with Starbucks for their in-store cafes since 1993 and 1999, respectively.

Capital One and Ralph Lauren both opened their first cafes in 2014. Capital One told CNBC that it now operates 65 cafes nationally. Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, operates over 40 cafes across the world, including in cities like London, Barcelona, Hong Kong and Singapore. Both companies are continuing to expand, with new openings planned for 2026.

Pine said Covid decimated the experience economy but that people are looking to spend their time out and about again. He noted that cafes are one of the primary ways to do that.

But as more companies jump on the trend, it will become increasingly commoditized, he said.

""It's something that you need to refresh to think about how you change this over time and you need to design it uniquely,"" Pine said. ""The Tiffany Blue Box Cafe [is] a beautiful example of that, so that it's not just about the coffee, it's about immersing you in the brand values, in the brand colors, in what it stands for.""

Coach put its own spin on the concept with pastries like the Tabby cake, an edible version of one of its best-selling handbags.

Source: Coach Inc.

At Capital One, cardholders of the namesake bank and Discover, which it acquired in a $35 billion stock deal in 2025, get half off beverage purchases.

Unlike Coach, the bank doesn't run the food and beverage operations. Capital One said its cafes are independently run by a third-party provider and it does not share in profits or losses. The bank can instead focus its efforts on how to leverage the space to increase its brand awareness.

""Bank accounts and credit cards and money are things that don't always feel tangible. And so the cafes can show up as a personification of what is Capital One,"" said Jennifer Windbeck, Capital One's head of retail bank channels.

Uniqlo said it owns and operates the majority of its cafes, including the one inside its New York City flagship location, which has a coffee bar on the second floor of the store.

Cessot said the goal was to make it a service area where guests can come pick up online orders, get their clothing repaired and customize their apparel.

""There's one aspect that is making profits, which we are obviously monitoring week over week, month over month. And then the second aspect is really about the customer. And really the reason why we opened this coffee is to really help our customer and enhance their shopping experience,"" Cessot said.

Summary

Microsoft Corporation is rated Buy, driven by strong AI and cloud momentum, robust leadership, and ambitious revenue targets.

MSFT delivered a stellar quarter with 18.4% Y/Y revenue growth, significant beats across all segments, and accelerating Azure AI services.

High CapEx and OpenAI-related risks are present, but strategic diversification and deep product integration support long-term growth.

MSFT targets $500B annual revenue by 2030, implying a feasible 12.16% CAGR and a potential $5.4T market cap.

Introduction

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has now completely expanded and transformed itself from a simple OS provider as it shifts towards Generative and Agentic AI, and has the benefits of its highly touted Azure infrastructure. With

As a detail-oriented investor with a strong foundation in finance and business writing, I focus on analyzing undervalued and disliked companies or industries that have strong fundamentals and good cash flows. I have a particular interest in sectors such as Oil&Gas and consumer goods. Basically, anything that has been unloved for unjustified reasons that could offer substantial returns. Energy Transfer is one of those companies that I came across when no one wanted to touch it and now I can't resolve myself to sell it. I will always focus more on long-term value investing but I can sometimes lose myself in possible deal arbitrage such as with Microsoft/ Activision Blizzard, Spirit Airlines/Jetblue (that one still hurts), and Nippon/U.S. Steel (perfect exit at $50.19). I tend to shun businesses that I can't understand either high-tech or certain consumer goods such as fashion (give me a Levi's jeans). I don't understand why anyone would invest in cryptocurrencies as well. Through Seeking Alpha, I aim to connect with like-minded investors, share insights, and build a collaborative community of individuals seeking superior returns and informed decision-making, currently on a quest to review every public company.

Quick Insights

MSFT’s CapEx, projected to exceed $80B annually by 2026, may compress gross margins short term but supports capacity expansion and long-term AI/cloud growth.

MSFT’s 27% OpenAI stake secures Azure revenue and IP access, but OpenAI’s diversification and competition with Copilot introduce both strategic hedging and margin risks.

Exceptional cloud and AI growth, integrated product suites, expanding margins, and credible 12%+ CAGR underpin the Buy rating and path to a $5.4T valuation by 2030.

The bottom line is that Lilly's competitive position is exceptionally strong, but it is being tested.
For a value investor, the question is whether the current price adequately discounts these risks while fully valuing the multi-decade growth potential of the new pillars.
Over the past 120 days, shares have rallied nearly 32%, a powerful move that underscores the market's belief in the company's growth trajectory.","Eli

has achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first healthcare company to reach a trillion-dollar market capitalization. The stock's ascent has been nothing short of vertiginous, with shares trading around $1,042 and a market cap of roughly $985 billion. This valuation places the company in an elite tier, worth more than twice the value of its closest pharmaceutical peer, Johnson & Johnson.

The growth story behind this price is undeniable. The company's blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have fueled a projected revenue jump from

. This explosive expansion is reflected in key valuation metrics. The stock's PEG ratio of 0.44 suggests the market is pricing in exceptionally high growth at a reasonable multiple, while the price-to-sales ratio of 16.6 underscores the premium placed on its future earnings power.

Yet, for a patient investor, the current price offers a narrow margin of safety. The average analyst price target sits at $1,096, implying only about 4.7% upside from recent levels. This minimal spread between the current price and the consensus target indicates that the market has already priced in a highly successful execution of the growth plan. The stock's recent underperformance, with shares down 3.5% today and 3.1% year-to-date, shows it is vulnerable to any stumble in the hyper-growth trajectory.

The bottom line is that Lilly's valuation is a bet on flawless, sustained execution. The company's competitive moat is wide, but the price for that privilege is high. For a disciplined investor, the prudent move is often to wait for a better entry point-a moment when the stock's price reflects the company's immense potential without demanding perfection in the near term.

The Width of the Competitive Moat: First-Mover Advantage and Clinical Superiority

Eli Lilly's ascent to a trillion-dollar valuation is built on a core growth engine of unprecedented scale and clinical perception. The combined sales of its two flagship GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, reached

. This staggering revenue has propelled the franchise to become the world's best-selling medicine, leapfrogging established giants like Merck's Keytruda. The durability of this engine hinges on two factors: a clear clinical edge and a strategic pipeline that aims to widen its lead.

Clinically, Lilly holds a distinct advantage. The company's drugs are viewed by physicians as more effective than Novo Nordisk's leading product, Wegovy. This perception is translating into market share, with

. This clinical superiority is not just a marketing point; it's a tangible moat that supports premium pricing and customer loyalty. The company is now preparing to extend this advantage into the oral market, where its drug orforglipron is . Analysts believe orforglipron, as a small molecule, will be easier to manufacture and distribute than Novo's peptide-based oral, potentially giving Lilly a supply and cost edge.

Yet, the path ahead is not without friction. The market's explosive demand has created severe supply constraints, a vulnerability that competitors have exploited. The rise of compound pharmacies filling the gap has hurt branded sales, with Novo executives pointing to this as a key drag. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is intensifying. Novo Nordisk launched its own oral Wegovy pill in early January, and the two companies are engaged in a fierce battle of clinical data, with a head-to-head study expected to read out soon. Lilly's moat is wide, but it is not impervious to pressure from a determined rival and the logistical challenges of meeting runaway demand.

The bottom line is that Lilly's competitive position is exceptionally strong, but it is being tested. The company's first-mover advantage in clinical perception and its pipeline depth provide a powerful foundation for compounding growth. However, the widening market also invites more competition and operational strain. For the stock to continue its ascent, Lilly must not only defend its current lead but also demonstrate that its clinical and manufacturing advantages are durable enough to withstand these mounting pressures.

Long-Term Compounding Potential vs. Near-Term Execution Risks

Eli Lilly's long-term compounding potential is now the central investment thesis. The company is aggressively building a multi-pillar franchise, moving far beyond its dominant incretin business. Over the past year, it has secured full FDA approval for its Alzheimer's drug Kisunla and completed major acquisitions to diversify its pipeline. The purchase of Morphic deepens its inflammatory bowel disease bet, while the deal for Scorpion Therapeutics adds precision oncology optionality. Its foray into radiopharmaceuticals, through the acquisition of POINT Biopharma and partnerships with Aktis and Radionetics, targets a high-growth field. Most ambitiously, the $1.3 billion acquisition of Verve Therapeutics for a ""one-and-done"" cardiovascular gene-editing therapy represents a long-horizon gamble on a transformative technology. This strategy is designed to create multiple, durable growth engines, ensuring the company's value can compound for decades.

The near-term execution risks, however, are substantial and multifaceted. The most immediate catalysts are clinical and competitive. This year will see Phase III results for the next-generation obesity drug retatrutide, which has already shown dramatic weight loss and pain reduction in early trials. More critically, the outcome of the head-to-head study between Novo Nordisk's CagriSema and Lilly's tirzepatide is expected in the first quarter. While Lilly has previously bested Novo's semaglutide in key metrics, a surprising win for the rival could pressure its market share and pricing power. The company's own oral obesity drug, orforglipron, is also poised for approval in the second quarter, adding another layer of competitive pressure and execution risk.

Regulatory and legal pressures form a persistent overhang. A new lawsuit filed by the Indiana Attorney General alleges Lilly participated in a scheme that inflated insulin prices by over 1,000% despite low manufacturing costs. This adds to the ongoing multistate litigation and regulatory scrutiny the company faces. More broadly, the potential for Medicare to expand coverage and negotiate prices for GLP-1 drugs is a major policy risk. A voluntary demonstration program is set to begin in July, with the possibility of mandatory coverage starting in January 2027. Such a move could compress margins and alter the entire reimbursement landscape for Lilly's blockbuster franchise.

The bottom line is a tension between a powerful long-term narrative and significant near-term hurdles. The pipeline diversification is a masterstroke for future value creation, but the stock's path will be dictated by the successful navigation of these clinical, competitive, and regulatory storms. For a value investor, the question is whether the current price adequately discounts these risks while fully valuing the multi-decade growth potential of the new pillars. The coming quarters will provide the answer.

Catalysts, Risks, and the Patient Investor's Watchlist

The stock's recent volatility is a direct reflection of its valuation. Over the past 120 days, shares have rallied nearly 32%, a powerful move that underscores the market's belief in the company's growth trajectory. Yet, in just the past five days, the stock has dropped about 3.5%. This choppiness is the hallmark of a stock priced for perfection, where every piece of news is scrutinized for signs of deviation from the high-growth script.

The forward view is dominated by two major catalysts that could reset the growth narrative. First is the launch of Lilly's oral obesity drug, orforglipron, which analysts expect to be approved in the

. This small-molecule pill is seen as a manufacturing advantage over competitors and could significantly expand the market. Second, the voluntary Medicare GLP-1 payment demonstration begins in July, a policy trial that could pave the way for mandatory coverage by January 2027. Both events are critical for validating the path to the company's ambitious $94.3 billion in annual revenue by 2027 target.

The key risk is that the current price leaves no room for error. With a forward P/E of 58.5 and a PEG ratio of just 0.44, the market is paying a premium for growth that must be flawless. Any stumble in GLP-1 adoption, a delay in the oral drug launch, or a miss on pipeline milestones could trigger a significant correction. The fierce rivalry with Novo Nordisk adds another layer of pressure, as the upcoming head-to-head study readout in Q1 will be a key competitive signal.

For the patient investor, the watchlist is clear. Monitor the Q2 orforglipron approval and launch execution. Track the Medicare demonstration's rollout and its potential to expand the addressable market. And watch the company's own pipeline, particularly the Phase III results for retatrutide, to see if the growth engine can continue to accelerate. The stock's recent price action shows it is already in a state of high anticipation. The next move will depend entirely on whether Lilly can consistently deliver on the promise already priced in.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1767710520093.jpg.png,N,,2026-01-06 11:02:51.316294

In a statement, Nimbus said it will now work with Lilly to ""apply [a] computational chemistry and structure-based drug design approach to an early-stage, small molecule discovery programme addressing a significant unmet need in obesity.""

Lilly has seen dramatic sales growth over the last couple of years from its injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP agonist obesity therapy Zepbound/Mounjaro (tirzepatide), and is hoping to add to its weight-loss stable with FDA approval for a new oral GLP-1 agonist, orforglipron, in the next few weeks.

With dozens of other candidates for obesity coming through the collective industry pipeline, directed at an expanding range of drug targets, the company has been actively building its pipeline with a series of licensing deals.

In 2025 alone, that included an $870 million collaboration with Camurus to apply its long-acting delivery technology to its injectable weight-loss candidates, which also include an experimental triple agonist – retatrutide – that achieved 29% weight loss in a phase 3 trial.

Last year also saw a $1.3 billion alliance with Superluminal to develop small molecule therapeutics targeting undisclosed GPCR targets involved in cardiometabolic diseases and obesity, and a $1.2 billion pact with SanegeneBio to seek out RNAi molecules against various metabolic targets.

Lilly's head of diabetes and metabolic R&D, Ruth Gimeno, said that Nimbus has ""demonstrated exceptional ability to tackle complex drug discovery challenges,"" and the potential new therapy ""represents an important addition to Lilly's efforts to advance innovative treatment options for patients.""",https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/2026-01/Lilly_Nimbus_logos_1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 10:01:35.658255

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-06 14:28:44+00:00,MEDIANAMA,Examining Voice-First AI Amid OpenAI Betting On Audio-Driven AI - MediaNama,Aakriti Bansal,,,,,https://www.medianama.com/2026/01/223-explained-openai-audio-first-personal-device-voice-first-ai/,"For context, TechCrunch, while citing The Information, reported that OpenAI has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to improve audio AI for an upcoming device and is developing a new audio model architecture focused on more natural and accurate responses.

Consequently, as audio-first systems become more widespread, these vulnerabilities turn voice-driven technology from a convenience into a potential point of failure.","OpenAI is reportedly reorganising teams and rebuilding its audio models ahead of an audio-first personal device launch. For context, TechCrunch, while citing The Information, reported that OpenAI has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to improve audio AI for an upcoming device and is developing a new audio model architecture focused on more natural and accurate responses.

Notably, the new audio model is expected to handle interruptions and speak while the user is talking, with a rollout timeframe around early 2026.

Pertinently, all these developments at OpenAI point to a larger question: what changes when AI becomes voice-first?

The significance here is not that OpenAI may ship new hardware, but in how companies now treat audio as a primary interface for AI: a change that reshapes how users experience accuracy, trust, privacy, and security.

What OpenAI is reportedly changing

OpenAI’s internal assessment, as reported by The Information, points to a clear problem. Its audio models lag behind its text models in both accuracy and response speed, a gap that becomes harder to ignore as more products move toward voice-led interaction.

That assessment reflects a broader shift already visible across major tech platforms. Voice assistants have become a default feature in homes through smart speakers. Meta has begun using multi-microphone arrays in its Ray-Ban smart glasses to actively process and enhance real-world conversations.

Meanwhile, Google has started experimenting with “Audio Overviews” that convert search results into spoken summaries rather than lists of links. And Tesla is integrating xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to allow drivers to control navigation-related commands.

Against this backdrop, OpenAI is not pursuing incremental improvements in text-to-speech. Instead, it is trying to unify its text and audio stack so the system can listen, reason, and respond in real time, including during overlapping conversational dynamics. As mentioned earlier, OpenAI’s next audio model will support more natural interaction, handle interruptions, and speak while the user is still talking.

If OpenAI succeeds, it moves AI away from turn-based chat and closer to ambient, continuous conversation, where voice becomes the primary interface.

What audio-first AI means in practice

Audio-first AI does not simply add voice input to an existing chatbot. It redesigns the interaction model so speech becomes the default channel in both directions.

That produces three practical shifts.

First, conversations rely less on turn-taking and more on overlap. If the system can respond while the user is speaking, interactions begin to resemble live conversation rather than typed Q&A.

Secondly, audio lowers friction. Users no longer open an app, type a query, and read a response. They speak, and the system speaks back.

And thirdly, the interaction becomes invisible. The interface no longer sits on a screen that users can pause, scroll, or inspect. It fades into the room, the car, or the wearable device.

Why voice changes how people trust AI

Voice reduces friction and reshapes credibility

Text interfaces introduce friction that can help users stay sceptical. Users can re-read responses, scroll back, or copy claims to verify them elsewhere. Voice-based interaction may reduce some of that friction because responses unfold in real-time and disappear once spoken.

Furthermore, a particular user’s experience in voice-led interactions can influence perceptions of credibility. To explain, a 2022 systematic review of voice assistant usability found that user acceptance is closely tied to overall usability and interaction experience, particularly in systems where voice is the primary mode of interaction.

Moreover, conversational systems can make uncertainty harder to notice. To explain, most audio systems tend to deliver a single response rather than signalling hesitation or asking for clarification, even when speech input contains ambiguity due to accents, background noise, overlapping speakers, or imperfect microphone capture. In such cases, users may have limited visibility into what the system actually heard or how confident it was in its interpretation.

As a result, trust dynamics may begin to shift before questions of privacy, regulation, or liability come into focus.

Trust shifts also complicate consent

The shift in trust dynamics has implications beyond perception. Audio-first systems rely on microphones that remain always on or close to it, increasing the likelihood of passive data capture and recording of bystanders.

Notably, European data protection regulators have cautioned that voice assistants raise specific data protection risks, particularly where audio is retained by default or speech is captured in shared environments, potentially conflicting with principles such as storage limitation and informed consent.

In the Indian context specifically, the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act requires that consent be “free, specific, informed, unconditional and unambiguous”, and that it be demonstrated through a clear affirmative action by the individual providing it, as set out in Section 6(1) of the Act.

However in practice, ambient audio makes that standard difficult to meet, as many affected individuals may never receive notice, let alone an opportunity to consent.

Who is responsible when voice assistants goes wrong

Voice-first AI does not merely change how users interact with systems. It also complicates questions of responsibility when those systems act in ways users did not intend.

A well-known example surfaced in earlier generations of voice assistants. In 2017, an Amazon Alexa device reportedly picked up a phrase during a television broadcast and placed an unintended order: a case that MediaNama later examined during its Governing the AI Ecosystem roundtable on agentic systems. Participants at the discussion argued that while the outcome was reversible, the incident highlighted how ambient, voice-triggered systems can act without a clear or deliberate user instruction.

Legal and policy experts at the roundtable differed on where liability should sit in such cases. Some argued that developers and manufacturers bear responsibility when foreseeable safeguards are missing, treating such failures as closer to product defects.

Others pointed to user-configurable settings, such as voice recognition controls or payment authorisations, as factors that could shift responsibility back to users. Several participants also cautioned that consent and choice can become illusory when systems rely on long, complex terms or default configurations that users rarely understand.

Overall, these views highlight how voice-first interaction blurs traditional boundaries between user action and system behaviour, complicating how responsibility is assigned when things go wrong.

Security risks specific to voice interfaces

Audio-first AI also expands the attack surface, as security research has shown. Unlike text-based systems, voice interfaces must continuously process ambient sound from their surroundings, increasing exposure to unintended inputs and malicious triggers.

As users often cannot see or review what the system has “heard”, errors or abuse can occur without immediate detection, making security failures harder to spot and contest.

Command injection can bypass human perception

Researchers behind the DolphinAttack paper demonstrated that attackers can embed voice commands into ultrasonic frequencies that humans cannot hear but microphones and speech recognition systems can still pick up.

In simple terms, a device can be made to “hear” a command even though the user hears nothing at all. For audio-first systems designed to listen continuously, this means actions could be triggered without the user ever realising a command was issued.

Spoofing no longer requires physical access

Advances in synthetic voice generation have also increased spoofing risks. In a widely cited case reported by Forbes, a fraudster used an AI-generated voice to impersonate a company executive and persuade an employee to transfer $243,000 (more than Rs 2.19 crore).

For consumer-facing devices the context differs, however the underlying lesson remains. If a system treats voice as proof of identity, it may be vulnerable to replayed recordings, synthetic voices, or other forms of impersonation. Speaker recognition, which attempts to verify a user based on vocal characteristics, can reduce some risk. But it cannot reliably distinguish between a real person and a high-quality imitation.

Consequently, as audio-first systems become more widespread, these vulnerabilities turn voice-driven technology from a convenience into a potential point of failure.

When applicable, we also compared the cost of name brand items with their store brand alternatives.
At Target, 2950 S. Chase Ave., prices decreased from $70.21 to $69.81.
After Aldi, the cheapest lists were those that used store brand alternatives to name brand items.
Piggly Wiggly's list totaled $82.18 for name brand items and $71.18 for the store brand items.","The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tracked the prices of 18 grocery items at 13 area stores in late December.

Aldi was the least expensive store for the list of items, totaling $48.32.

Prices for a list of name-brand items at Walmart, Woodman's, Meijer, and Target all saw slight decreases from November.

Local stores like Sendik's, El Rey, Metcalfe's, and Outpost Co-op were among the most expensive options.

Every month, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tracks the prices of groceries at major Milwaukee-area grocery stores.

On Dec. 29 and Dec. 30, the Journal Sentinel collected the price of a list of groceries at 13 stores, from national retail chains to local cooperatives. When applicable, we also compared the cost of name brand items with their store brand alternatives.

Prices do not include limited-time deals or discounts.

The grocery list is as follows:

A half-gallon of almond milk

A loaf of whole wheat bread

One pound of bacon

One pound of bananas

One pound of 80/20 ground beef, not Angus certified

One pound of butter in a four-pack

A box of Cheerios

A box of Cheez-Its

A dozen eggs

A five-pound bag of flour

Canned green beans

An 18-ounce jar of strawberry jam

A head of iceberg lettuce

A gallon of whole milk

One navel orange

A two-roll pack of paper towels

A 16-ounce jar of peanut butter

A six-pack of toilet paper

How prices at Walmart, Target, Meijer and Woodman's compare to last month

On Nov. 19, the list of name brand items at Walmart, 4140 W. Greenfield Ave. in West Milwaukee, cost just over $70. The price has since dropped to $68.76.

Groceries at Woodman's at 8131 S. Howell Ave. in Oak Creek dropped from $69.80 on Nov. 21 to $67.22 on Dec. 29.

Other stores saw smaller price drops. Groceries at Meijer, 11111 W. Burleigh St. in Wauwatosa, totaled $74.02, 14 cents cheaper than in November.

At Target, 2950 S. Chase Ave., prices decreased from $70.21 to $69.81.

The overall price drops at these stores can largely be attributed to the falling price of bacon, usually one of the most expensive items on the list. The cost of a pound of Oscar Mayer bacon at Walmart dropped from $8.48 in November to $7.48 on Dec. 29.

Aldi brands are cheapest for the list of items we bought

Aldi does not offer the same name brands that other large retailers do, so we tracked the prices of equivalent items at the store located at 225 E. Capitol Drive.

Aldi's list totaled $48.32, the least expensive of all stores tracked.

After Aldi, the cheapest lists were those that used store brand alternatives to name brand items. Walmart's store brand list totaled $53.95, followed by Meijer at $56.52.

Groceries more expensive at Pick 'n Save, Festival Foods, Whole Foods

Pricier options include Pick 'n Save at 1100 E. Garfield Ave., Piggly Wiggly at 123 W. Oklahoma Ave., Whole Foods at 2305 N. Prospect Ave. and Festival Foods at 11111 W. Greenfield Ave. in West Allis.

Pick 'n Save's name brand list cost $81.23, down slightly from $81.53 on Nov. 19. Substituting for store brand items brought the price down to $59.13.

Piggly Wiggly's list totaled $82.18 for name brand items and $71.18 for the store brand items.

Groceries at Whole Foods, which carries its own brand in place of many name brand items, cost $81.62 on Dec. 30. West Allis' Festival Foods was even pricier, totaling $93.78.

How did prices compare at Sendik's, Outpost and El Rey?

The Journal Sentinel also tracked prices at notable local grocery stores, including Outpost Co-op at 100 E. Capitol Drive; Sendik's Food Market, 8616 W. North Ave. in Wauwatosa; Metcalfe's Market, 6700 W. State St. in Wauwatosa; and El Rey Family Market, 5200 W. Oklahoma Ave.

Like Aldi, these stores do not carry many of the name brand items we track on this list, so they've been substituted for equivalent store or name brands.

Sendik's Food Market was the cheapest of the four local stores at $84.74. It was followed by El Rey Family Market, a family-owned Hispanic grocery store, at $88.49.

Metcalfe's Market, which has two locations in Madison and one in Wauwatosa, totaled $91.82 in December.

Outpost Co-op's list was the most expensive of all stores tracked, totaling $102.12. That's more than double the cost of the cheapest list, Aldi, located just a block east of Outpost on Capitol Drive.

Outpost carries many organic produce and dairy items, which are generally more expensive than conventionally farmed foods. The cooperative also offers deals and savings exclusive to owners, who pay $200 for a share in the store.

Smith told CNBC in November L.L.","Last year’s slew of CEO changes means many retailers and CPGs are starting off the year preparing for major leadership transitions...or hoping to finally end their ongoing executive searches. Here are the chief exec changes we’re keeping an eye on this year:

CEOs we already know

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is retiring after 12 years leading the big box retailer, with Walmart US CEO John Furner taking over as chief exec on February 1. Furner will look to continue Walmart’s current momentum: The retailer’s latest quarterly earnings exceeded analyst expectations, highlighted by strong grocery and health and wellness sales and a booming ecommerce presence. One of Furner’s biggest tasks ahead will be leading Walmart further into its AI era.

Target’s new COO Michael Fiddelke will also assume his new role as CEO in February as Brian Cornell shifts to executive chair. Fiddelke faces an uphill battle after a decidedly off-target (pun intended) year for the retailer that saw continuing foot traffic declines and falling comp sales as consumers pull back spend on discretionary goods.

The Coca-Cola Company’s new CEO Henrique Braun will step into his role on March 31, as nine-year CEO James Quincey moves to become executive chair. Braun, who joined Coca-Cola in 1996 and has served as COO for the last year, will take the helm as the beverage giant continues to outperform its rival, PepsiCo, in a tricky CPG environment, thanks in part to popularity of its zero-sugar drinks.

CEOs that are TBD

Coty faced a management shake-up in late December when controlling shareholder JAB Holdings reportedly pushed for the exits of chair Peter Harf and five-year CEO Sue Nabi. The company had an underwhelming 2025, launching a review of its mass beauty business in September that could mean the sale of CoverGirl and Rimmel, and losing its license to make Gucci fragrances to L’Oréal in 2028.

On December 22, Coty announced Procter & Gamble vet Markus Strobel, who was most recently head of P&G’s global skin and personal care business, will become its executive chair and interim CEO starting January 1. The company didn’t share its plans for naming a permanent chief exec.

Kroger is still looking for its next leader after 11-year CEO Rodney McMullen suddenly resigned in March. Interim CEO Ronald Sargent said in December the new chief exec, whom it aims to announce in Q1, will be an external hire, the first in the grocer’s 143-year history. Sargent said Kroger is looking for a candidate with “a deep understanding of retail transformation” who is “very close to the customer.”

Lululemon is still on the hunt for a replacement for CEO Calvin McDonald, who will exit his role on January 31 after leading the activewear brand since 2018. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which now has a $1 billion stake in Lululemon, has its sights on former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as his successor.

7-Eleven’s CEO Joseph DePinto retired at the end of 2025 after 20+ years leading the convenience chain. President Stan Reynolds and COO Douglas Rosencrans filled the role as co-CEOs on an interim basis while its board of directors searches for DePinto’s successor.

L.L. Bean’s President and CEO Stephen Smith will depart his role in the spring after a decade leading the outerwear and apparel maker. Smith told CNBC in November L.L. Bean was “cautiously optimistic” about its holiday performance after a “volatile year” in consumer goods.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/706a7d4f65bafc712cb9c83ef64ed4612752770a-6960x4640.jpg?rect=0,493,6960,3654&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-06 11:03:03.261783

The retailer announced that it is running ads within Sparky, its AI shopping agent, after testing the first ads within the tool last fall.

Sparky is an AI shopping assistant within Walmart’s mobile app. Shoppers can ask Sparky questions and prompts to find products, and Sparky analyzes products and reviews to recommend products available at Walmart.

Ads within Sparky appear as a sponsored prompt when shoppers ask the tool questions for product recommendations. In a survey of Walmart customers, Walmart reports that 81% of shoppers have used Sparky to look up product availability and details about a product before purchasing. Search is the most popular use case for Sparky, according to Walmart.

“We know it’s an interesting new surface, and we want to be there and experiment in that new surface—even though it’s early days,” Khurrum Malik, VP of business and product marketing for Walmart Connect, told ADWEEK. Walmart Connect is Walmart’s advertising arm.

Walmart’s Sparky directly competes with Amazon’s gen AI agent Rufus, which began running ads in 2024.

In addition to Sparky, Walmart inked a deal with OpenAI last year that allows people to shop from ChatGPT.

Malik said one way Walmart is hoping to differentiate itself from competitors is with its scale. Walmart has 150 million weekly shoppers across 4,600 stores and online.

“If you think about our advertisers, they want simplicity, they want automation, so agentic experiences help there,” Malik said.

Gen AI-driven ads

In July, Walmart announced an AI assistant called Marty, which helps Walmart’s suppliers and advertisers manage retail operations as well as advertising.

Now, Walmart is rolling out a beta program within Marty that manages sponsored search campaigns. Marty analyzes sponsored search campaigns to offer advertisers campaign recommendations on things such as bidding and keywords. Marty also spits out reports about the performance of campaigns, including share of voice, a metric that tracks an advertisers’ market share relative to competitors.

According to Walmart, 97% of queries for Marty are unique, indicating that advertisers are using the tool for custom use cases. Marty’s recommendations are particularly helpful for emerging advertisers, including small businesses and midsize brands that want tailored suggestions for their campaigns, Malik said.

Marty will be available to all of Walmart’s advertisers that buy search ads in Walmart Connect Ad Center in the first half of this year. Malik said that Marty will also expand to Walmart’s other ad formats this year.

“Over time, you can imagine Marty playing a role as a cross-surface tool where you can go and help an advertiser invest in any of the surfaces where we can help them drive sales,” Malik said.

Walmart is also betting on creative applications of gen AI for advertisers this year. A tool called Automated Creative Generator helps advertisers spin up creative like background for product photos. Walmart claims that the tool reduces production time by 80%.

More broadly, Malik said that advertisers are increasingly investing brand-oriented budgets as well as performance budgets with Walmart. In one example, Walmart began pitching advertisers on connected TV campaigns last year after acquiring smart TV manufacturer Vizio.

“Advertisers are increasingly asking us, ’Hey, you’ve been helping us with performance solutions—help us with upper funnel as well,’” Malik said.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Walmart-Sparky.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2026-01-06 10:02:26.763476

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

HP Inc. announced Monday it’s looking to blaze new trails by moving all of the compute from an all-in-one PC into the keyboard form factor.

The result is the HP EliteBoard G1a, announced Monday as the latest addition to the HP AI PC portfolio.

[Related: HP Debuts EliteBook X G2 Series At CES 2026: 10 Big Things To Know]

The PC giant also disclosed Monday it is making big strides to advance GenAI performance on its premium EliteBook X commercial notebooks with the launch of second-generation AI PC devices in the series.

The announcements come in connection with the massive CES 2026 conference, taking place this week in Las Vegas.

What follows are five key details to know about HP’s EliteBoard G1a.

New Design Approach

The HP EliteBoard G1a represents a major reversal from past desktop PC design, according to HP.

The new design moves the compute power that once had to be located within the all-in-one or tower form factor, and embeds it directly into the keyboard.

By contrast, the traditional all-in-one PC design approach locks users into a single display (and working location, to some degree) for the life of the PC.

With the EliteBoard, instead, the entire PC is housed within the keyboard chassis, HP said.

Display Flexibility

For users that might wish to change displays over time, this allows those users to choose any display configuration without replacing the device itself, according to HP.

Notably, the approach also gives organizations and users more control over upgrade cycles and workspace customization, the company said.

In addition to stationary workers seeking more flexibility, HP also built the EliteBoard G1a around users that might share a display, such as in the health care space, HP said.

Device Options

Two versions of the HP EliteBoard G1a will be available to accommodate the two types of use cases, according to HP.

For users that need to share a display, one version of the device will offer a detachable cable and integrated battery, the company said.

Meanwhile, the stationary configuration features a lockable cable designed for environments where devices must remain physically secured, HP said.

Performance, Portability And Productivity

On performance, HP also classifies the EliteBoard G1a as an AI PC, with an AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series chip powering the device.

The device offers more than 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of neural processing unit (NPU) performance for highly responsive workloads, according to HP.

On portability, meanwhile, the EliteBoard G1a measures 12mm (0.47 of an inch) in terms of thickness and weighs about 1.65 pounds, HP said.

For productivity and collaboration, the keyboard-PC also includes dual mics and speakers, according to the company.

Pricing And Availability

The EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC is expected to be available starting in March, HP announced

Pricing was not immediately disclosed and will be provided “closer to availability,” the company said in its news release.",https://www.crn.com/news/computing/2026/media_1aacfb8a0474a292fa9587518e7ad2e6412572a01.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-06 11:03:00.169981

The update was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026, where the partners outlined progress on a global robotaxi programme.

According to the companies, autonomous testing began in December 2025 and is intended to support a commercial launch expected later this year in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Testing activities are being led by Nuro, using robotaxi engineering prototypes overseen by autonomous vehicle operators.

Lucid Autonomous & ADAS vice president Kay Stepper said: “Our robotaxi programme with Uber and Nuro is a key part of how Lucid is leveraging its technology to create a more sustainable future of mobility that is widely accessible.”

The vehicle platform is based on the all-electric Lucid Gravity and incorporates a “next-gen” sensor suite that combines cameras, solid-state lidar and radar systems to deliver 360-degree perception.

These components are integrated into the vehicle body as well as a purpose-built, “low-profile” roof-mounted halo.

The halo features integrated LEDs designed to help passengers identify the correct vehicle, display rider initials and indicate ride status from pick-up to drop-off, the press statement read.

Inside the cabin, passengers can manage settings such as seating, climate and music, access support functions, or request the vehicle to pull over, the press statement further added.

Visualisation screens display what the robotaxi is detecting and its intended route in real time, including interactions with traffic lights, pedestrians and surrounding vehicles.

The robotaxi is configured to accommodate up to six passengers and includes luggage capacity aimed at group travel.

Computing capability is delivered through NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, part of the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform, supporting AI processing for autonomous driving.

Lucid said the on-road trials form part of Nuro’s safety and validation framework, which evaluates multiple functions across the full autonomy stack, including Nuro’s end-to-end AI foundation model.

Nuro co-founder and co-CEO Dave Ferguson added: “The debut of our production-intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale.”

The programme also incorporates closed-course testing and simulation to assess performance across a wide range of driving scenarios.

Subject to final validation, the companies expect the production-intent robotaxi to enter production later this year at Lucid’s manufacturing facility in Arizona.

Uber Autonomous Mobility & Delivery global head Sarfraz Maredia added: “Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year.”

The case is part of investigations sparked by a massive fraud carried out for years in several European countries, revealed by a consortium of European news outlets in 2018.

Several banks were raided after the allegations emerged, and some have already agreed to fines to avoid further prosecution.

""A hearing to validate the deal concerning HSBC in the fiscal domain will take place Thursday at 10:00 am,"" the legal source said, without further details.

In December, Bloomberg News reported the fine would be EUR300 million (USD350 million) to close the investigation, which the Paris financial prosecutor's office has not confirmed.

Contacted by AFP, HSBC declined to comment but referred to a note from its third-quarter earnings statement in October, which cited an EUR300 million provision for an inquiry ""relating to dividend withholdings of certain legacy trading activities"".

The financial prosecutor's office launched in December 2021 inquiries into six large banks, which a source close to the case confirmed as HSBC, Credit Agricole unit Cacib, BNP Paribas and its Exane unit, Societe Generale and Natixis.

In September, Credit Agricole's Cacib was the first to accept a deal with French prosecutors, agreeing to pay EUR88 million .

The fraud is known as ""CumCum"" and involves an investor selling shares to another party just before dividend payment day, to avoid paying taxes, and then immediately repurchasing the shares, with both parties sharing the illicit proceeds.

It was exposed alongside a similar ""Cum-ex"" dividend tax fraud published by the media consortium in 2018.

The amounts involved in the ""Cum-ex"" frauds alone are suspected to have reached 140 billion euros (USD151 billion) over a period of 20 years, the media group said in 2021.

The aim is ""to avoid paying the tax applicable to the payment of this dividend,"" the consortium said.

Banks are suspected of acting as intermediaries in the practice and even charging a commission to the investors taking part.

In December 2022, a German court sentenced lawyer Hanno Berger, believed to be the original mastermind of the scheme, to eight years in prison.

HSBC shares were up 1.1% at 1,220.20 pence in London on Tuesday afternoon.

(HPQ) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","HP Inc. provides personal computing, printing, and other related technologies in the United States and internationally. Formerly known as Hewlett-Packard, the company changed its name in October 2015. It serves small- and medium-sized businesses, the public sector, and large enterprises.

Key challenges remain for HP in 2026 including changes in customer purchasing behavior and industry component availability. A difficult macroeconomic environment and lingering inflationary conditions do not bode well for the company’s outlook.

HP’s forecast for fiscal 2026 PC demand raises concerns regarding its growth prospects in the short-term. Management expects PC unit volumes to fall in the current year. Lower volumes and price pressures would make it harder to protect margins and meet earnings targets.

The computing giant faces stiff competition for its PC and printer businesses. The PC segment competes with the likes of Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and Acer. In the latest quarter, print revenues fell 4% year-over-year as office demand in North America and Europe remained soft. The print segment will likely continue to face structural challenges as customers reduce printing volumes and shift to digital workflows.

The Zacks Rundown

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, HP HPQ is a component of the Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 14% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.

Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be intriguing short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they’re part of a lagging industry, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.

HPQ shares have been underperforming the market over the past year. The stock is trading near a 52-week low even as the major U.S. indexes hover near all-time highs.

Recent Earnings Misses & Deteriorating Outlook

HP has fallen short of earnings estimates in four of the past six quarters. The technology company posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -2.6%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and HP is no exception.

The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking at the current fiscal year, analysts have slashed estimates by -9.64% in the past 60 days. The FY2026 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $3.00 per share, reflecting negative growth of -3.9% relative to the prior year.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.

Technical Outlook

As illustrated below, HPQ stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has shown little in the way of a trend, widely underperforming the major indices. Also note that shares are trading below downward-sloping 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages – another good sign for the bears.

Image Source: StockCharts

HPQ stock has experienced what is known as a “death cross,” whereby the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Shares would have to make an outsized move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. The stock has fallen more than 30% in the past year alone.

Final Thoughts

A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way to new highs anytime soon. The fact that HPQ stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns.

A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.

Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of HP until the situation shows major signs of improvement.

AI has been major focus of partnership

Mobile app use up 19% during 2025 Championships

Wimbledon has extended its official artificial intelligence (AI), cloud and digital transformation partnership with IBM, prolonging one of the most successful technology partnerships in sport.

The tech giant first teamed up with the All England Club (AELTC) in 1990. In 1995 they launched an official website and the arrangement now encompasses a wide a range of tools and infrastructure designed to support the tennis Grand Slam’s operations, data gathering and fan engagement activities.

This latest ‘multi-year’ renewal will amplify these efforts and extend the relationship well into a fourth decade.

AI has been a particular focus of the two’s efforts in recent years, with intelligent technologies used to automatically clip and package highlights packages for multiple digital platforms, create data-driven insights for fans, and personalise content.

Usama Al-Qassab, marketing and commercial director at the AELTC, told SportsPro AI last year that Wimbledon’s expanded use of AI helped drive mobile app usage by 19 per cent during the 2025 Championships, with the tournament recording a total 19.1 billion engagements across its digital, social and broadcast channels.

“We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,” said Al-Qassab. “For 35 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships. As we look to attract the next generation of Wimbledon fans from around the world, the AI-powered capabilities of IBM will be key to ensuring our future digital experiences are relevant, personalised and engaging.”

For IBM, the partnership has provided a high-profile use case and proving ground for its infrastructure, software and intelligent capabilities which are used across multiple industries. Other partners in the sports industry include the US Open and the Masters golf major.

“Our partnership with Wimbledon represents the very best of what a long-term, strategic collaboration can be. It’s rooted in shared values, trust built over time, and a joint commitment to constant innovation,” Jonathan Adashek, SVP, marketing and communications, IBM told SportsPro.

“We’ve set the bar for how sports properties can harness technology to modernise their operations, become more productive and create new loyalties that span generations of fans – all while staying true to their brand heritage.

“The same AI and data platforms we use to enhance the fan experience at Wimbledon are the ones we put into the hands of our clients in industries all across the globe. The partnership becomes a live showcase of how we are applying AI where it meaningfully improves how people experience the event.”

SportsPro says…

Wimbledon’s digital strategy has two clear goals. The first is to use technology to ensure the tournament runs as smoothly as possible, and the second is to engage fans in attendance in SW19 and those watching around the world.

Not everything has gone to plan, as demonstrated by the human error-related mishaps with electronic line calling (ELC) this summer, being evidence of that. But in general, most of its innovation has been successful.

For the past three decades, its partnership with IBM has been crucial to this mission – introducing many cutting-edge technologies and establishing best practices for the industry in the process.

Indeed, the Grand Slam claims its smartphone app was the first to include such detailed live sports data when it launched in 2009 and it was using ‘cognitive computing’ long before AI became the sports technology term de jour.

In many ways, it has been the prototype for the modern sports technology partnership, prioritising genuine technical need over gimmickry and marketing considerations – even if the commercial value of this deal is significant to IBM given the popularity of Wimbledon.

This extension continues one of the most celebrated partnerships in the industry, providing prestige to both parties, and providing plenty of reference cases for the industry to benefit from.

One in four consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025, and a further 31 per cent plan to adopt them in the future.
Data transparency remains a major concern, with 71 per cent of consumers worried about how generative AI uses personal information.
According to the report, brands that combine speed and personalisation with timely human support are more likely to earn long-term consumer loyalty.","Consumer priorities are shifting in 2026, with fairness emerging as a central element of perceived value, according to a new global consumer trends report from the Capgemini Research Institute. The report, titled What matters to today’s consumer 2026: How AI is transforming value perception, finds that concerns over declining purchasing power and financial uncertainty are prompting consumers to be more deliberate about how they save money and where they choose to spend.

The fifth edition of the annual report shows that consumers are balancing essential spending with intentional indulgences that provide emotional uplift. While many are embracing artificial intelligence to help navigate the marketplace, issues around data control and transparency remain significant, with consumers favouring brands that combine digital convenience with in-person support.

Price transparency and honest communication are now seen as key markers of brand credibility. Nearly three in four consumers (74 per cent) say they would switch brands for a lower regular price, while 71 per cent would do so if pack sizes or quality were reduced without clear notice. A majority of respondents consider shrinkflation to be unfair, with most indicating a preference for a small, clearly communicated price increase rather than discreet downsizing.

The research also finds that around half of consumers are buying smaller quantities and opting for cheaper alternatives to manage their budgets. However, brand trust remains strong in categories where quality and performance are critical. According to the report, 77 per cent of consumers across income groups avoid private labels for products such as electronics and baby care. At the same time, emotional factors continue to influence purchasing decisions, with seven in ten consumers seeking small indulgences to ease financial stress, highlighting that value is both practical and emotional.

“Value today goes beyond price and quality; it’s built on fairness, transparency, and emotional connection. Consumers want invisible AI that both empowers informed decisions and seamlessly blends convenience and emotional connection,” said Dreen Yang, Global Consumer Products & Retail Leader at Capgemini. “AI is increasingly reshaping the shopping experience, but success depends on clarity, responsible use, and safeguards that protect consumers. Brands that blend technology with trust and purpose will enjoy lasting loyalty.”

The report notes that AI is evolving from a functional tool into a trusted shopping advisor. AI now supports consumers by interpreting preferences and behaviours and by offering real-time assistance through chatbots and virtual assistants. One in four consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025, and a further 31 per cent plan to adopt them in the future. Despite this growth, only 19 per cent of consumers say they are willing to pay a monthly subscription or one-time fee for chatbots or virtual shopping assistants.

While adoption is increasing, consumers continue to express caution. The majority of shoppers (76 per cent) want the ability to set boundaries for AI assistants, and two-thirds say they trust AI more when it explains the reasoning behind its recommendations and actions. Data transparency remains a major concern, with 71 per cent of consumers worried about how generative AI uses personal information. Two-thirds of consumers also expect brands to disclose when advertising content is AI-generated.

The findings further show that technology alone is not enough to secure loyalty. Consumers want efficiency, relevance, and human connection to coexist. Nearly two-thirds of respondents want generative AI to deliver hyper-personalised content, and 65 per cent say technology has made shopping less stressful. However, more than seven in ten consumers still value human assistance for complex purchases, such as meal planning or resolving service issues. According to the report, brands that combine speed and personalisation with timely human support are more likely to earn long-term consumer loyalty.",https://static.businessworld.in/BW Style Pic (36)_20260106171724_ogImage_48.png,N,,2026-01-06 10:01:31.057267

As with the Light Straight + Multi-styler, pricing and additional specifications will be shared closer to commercial availability.","L’Oréal Groupe has unveiled two new beauty technology innovations that apply infrared light to hair and skin, reinforcing its long-term focus on science-led product development. Introduced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the Light Straight + Multi-styler and the LED Face Mask both received CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree recognition, highlighting their use of advanced light-based technologies to enhance performance while addressing common concerns around hair damage and skin ageing.

The announcement continues L’Oréal’s multi-year push to integrate scientific research, digital capabilities and hardware innovation into consumer beauty products. The company positions these developments as part of its broader ambition to evolve from a traditional beauty brand into a beauty technology leader, using scientific discovery to create more personalised, effective and preventative beauty solutions.

Barbara Lavernos, Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology at L’Oréal Groupe, said the company’s latest showcase at CES reflects a long-standing belief that beauty and science are closely linked. She noted that L’Oréal continues to combine scientific advances with creativity to design beauty experiences that are both more effective and better adapted to individual needs, building on more than a century of research heritage.

Infrared light redefines heat styling with Light Straight + Multi-styler

The Light Straight + Multi-styler addresses one of the most persistent challenges in hair styling: heat damage. Traditional hair straighteners often reach temperatures of 400°F or higher, exceeding the threshold at which keratin begins to denature. Over time, this can weaken the hair cuticle, lead to breakage and reduce shine. According to a 2024 US consumer study conducted by L’Oréal, 58 percent of women surveyed said their hair damage was caused by heat styling.

Developed by L’Oréal Research and Innovation, the Light Straight + Multi-styler uses patented infrared light technology to deliver styling results at lower temperatures. The device’s glass plates never exceed 320°F, a significant reduction compared to conventional straighteners. Instrumental tests carried out by L’Oréal indicate that the device works three times faster than leading premium hair stylers while leaving hair twice as smooth.

At the core of the device is near-infrared light, which sits just beyond the visible light spectrum. This wavelength penetrates deeply into the hair fibre, reshaping the internal hydrogen bonds that determine hair texture and form. By targeting these bonds directly, the Light Straight + Multi-styler aims to achieve the desired styling effect while preserving the integrity of the hair cuticle, keeping hair smoother, shinier and stronger over time.

Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of Augmented Beauty and Open Innovation at L’Oréal Groupe, described the device as a shift from corrective styling to preventative care. He said limiting cumulative heat exposure from the outset helps protect the natural structure of hair, setting a new standard for precision styling and redefining expectations within the hairstyling category.

Beyond straightening, the Light Straight + Multi-styler is designed as a versatile, multi-function tool. It can also be used to curl hair, offering users greater flexibility without requiring multiple devices. The product incorporates smart internal sensors powered by proprietary algorithms and machine learning, allowing it to adapt to user gestures and deliver more personalised results.

The launch builds on L’Oréal’s earlier introduction of the Airlight Pro hair dryer, first revealed at CES 2024, which also uses infrared light technology. Together, the two devices form a complete infrared-based hairstyling routine focused on minimising damage while maintaining performance. The Light Straight + Multi-styler is scheduled for global release in 2027, with pricing details to be announced closer to launch.

LED Face Mask targets visible ageing with precision light therapy

Alongside its hairstyling innovation, L’Oréal also introduced the development of an LED Face Mask, further expanding its use of light technology into skincare. Currently in prototype form, the ultra-thin mask is made from flexible silicone and is designed to deliver targeted light therapy directly to the face. It was developed in collaboration with iSmart, a specialist in LED device innovation.

The LED Face Mask uses a combination of red light and near-infrared light, which L’Oréal believes will help combat visible signs of ageing, including fine lines, sagging and uneven skin tone. Each session lasts 10 minutes and is automatically timed, allowing the device to fit easily into daily skincare routines without adding complexity.

A key feature of the mask is its transparent support structure, which integrates a skin-safe microcircuit to precisely control light emission. The device delivers two specific wavelengths: red light at 630 nanometres and near-infrared light at 830 nanometres. These wavelengths are selected for their ability to visibly firm and smooth skin while promoting a more even tone, according to L’Oréal’s testing assumptions.

The design prioritises comfort and usability. Its lightweight, non-invasive construction allows it to sit closely against the skin, ensuring consistent light delivery across the face. By focusing on controlled, targeted exposure, L’Oréal aims to maximise visible results while maintaining safety and ease of use.

The LED Face Mask is expected to launch in 2027. In the United States, its release will be subject to the FDA 510(k) premarket notification process. As with the Light Straight + Multi-styler, pricing and additional specifications will be shared closer to commercial availability.

Together, the two CES 2026 showcases underline L’Oréal’s continued investment in longevity science, personalised beauty and device-led innovation. With a global research network spanning 21 centres across 13 countries and thousands of scientists and digital specialists, the group is positioning light-based technology as a core pillar of its future product strategy, extending beyond topical formulations into hardware that reshapes how consumers approach haircare and skincare at home.",https://www.techedt.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LOreal-brings-infrared-light-technology-to-hair-and-skincare-with-two-new-beauty-tech-innovations-at-CES-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 11:03:35.349651

LONDON, Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and The All England Lawn Tennis Club today announced a multi-year renewal of their long-standing, landmark technology partnership. From the launch of the Wimbledon website in 1995 and the mobile application in 2009, to the first integration of enhanced AI-powered solutions in 2017, IBM and the All England Club have collaborated for 36 years to deepen global fan engagement across Wimbledon's world-class digital platforms.

The successful partnership between IBM and the All England Club has long set the standard for creating engaging fan-facing features that have raised the bar for tech innovation in sport. Building on more than three decades of continuous innovation, the new agreement is focused on initiatives to expand the event's global reach and achieve a deeper fan engagement across Wimbledon's digital ecosystem in 2026 and beyond.

Teams from IBM and the All England Club work together year-round to co-create unique fan experiences – such as Live Likelihood to Win and Match Chat – that combine the significant quantity of data generated during The Championships with the deep AI capabilities of IBM watsonx. In 2025, these efforts contributed to a 16% year-on-year increase in engagement across all platforms, with more than 20 million fans closely following all the grass court action via the app and website. The app alone saw a 19% increase in engagement and received an outstanding average rating of 4.9 stars in app stores.

The partnership has also won multiple awards, including the All England Club being recognised as 'Sports Organisation of the Year' at the 2025 Sports Technology Awards, for the innovative use of AI and technology to transform the Wimbledon fan experience.

""We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,"" said Usama Al-Qassab, Marketing & Commercial Director, The All England Lawn Tennis Club. ""For 36 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships. As we look to attract the next generation of Wimbledon fans from around the world, the AI-powered capabilities of IBM will be key to ensuring our future digital experiences are relevant, personalised and engaging.""

""The All England Club is a visionary organisation, delivering one of the most globally recognisable properties in sport and broader culture. We are thrilled to continue working in lockstep as partners to serve up a world-class digital experience, driven by leading edge data and AI technology,"" said Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Communications, IBM. ""Whether onsite at SW19 or following from any corner of the globe for years to come, hundreds of millions of tennis fans can rely on having interactive digital features, powered by watsonx, to stay connected to the beauty, drama and excitement of The Championships.""

The FTC sued Instacart for deceptive practices including misleading ""free delivery,"" unclear satisfaction guarantees, undisclosed fees, and unlawful free-trial-to-paid memberships. Instacart has now reached a $60 million settlement to refund hundreds of thousands of consumers and impose future compliance restrictions.

Investigations found that Instacart's algorithmic pricing experiments led to significant price disparities (up to 23% higher for some users), exacerbating consumer frustration amid already high grocery prices and raising concerns about fairness and transparency.

The case reinforces that traditional consumer protection laws apply to AI-enabled markets. While the White House's AI Action Plan promotes innovation and minimal new regulation, it preserves FTC authority to enforce transparency, consent, and fairness in automated systems.

The action highlights a growing divide between consumer advocates, who argue automated and personalized systems can scale consumer harm and require strong enforcement, and industry groups, who warn that aggressive enforcement may chill AI innovation, investment, and competitive experimentation.

FTC's Settlement Action Against Instacart Reinforces Need for AI Systems Regulation

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Instacart for engaging in numerous deceptive tactics against consumers through unclear labels and disclosures, resulting in raised grocery prices and recurring memberships without consent. Instacart has agreed to settle through paying $60 million in refunds to affected customers.

Other internal and external research had already shown how Instacart's AI-driven pricing experiments impacted various family budgets. It was found that some quoted prices to consumers were up to approximately 23% higher than those shown to others, even for the same cart and time.

This AI-powered pricing tool, known as Eversight, allows for retailers to conduct price tests to gauge reactions of consumers and efficiency to higher and lower prices across different categories of items. Instacart's website noted that grocers who use this tool ""see revenue growth of 1 to 3%."" Instacart claimed these tests were randomized and, among other companies utilizing this tool, was scrutinized, emphasizing that ""consumers deserve to know when they are being placed into pricing tests. The FTC should require a prominent on-screen label,"" as stated by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The practice of dynamic pricing raised concerns and increased consumer frustration with grocery prices already being at significantly higher levels. Reports from several nonprofit consumer advocacy groups found that the prices of items in Instacart baskets varied by an average of 7% across 437 shoppers in four cities testing for the same items at the same stores. Shortly after, the FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand for further information on Eversight.

This recent enforcement action against Instacart is an example of how traditional consumer protection principles continue to apply in increasingly automated and technology-driven markets. It reinforces that representations made and marketed to consumers about pricing, fees, or savings must be transparent, regardless of them being generated or influenced by algorithms or other advanced technologies.

The AI Action Plan released by the White House this past summer, while emphasizing the importance of fostering innovation and competition in artificial intelligence, does not carve out exemptions from existing consumer protection laws. It explicitly preserves and reinforces the role of agencies such as the FTC in addressing unfair or deceptive practices involving AI-enabled systems, as we previously covered. The enforcement action is grounded in traditional consumer protection law by addressing false advertising, undisclosed fees, and unfair practices harming shoppers. In contrast, the AI Action Plan leans toward market-friendly AI adoption and minimal federal constraints, leaving Big Tech and startups to consider how AI systems interact with consumer rights.

In the complaint, three components of Instacart's deceptive tactics were highlighted:

""Free Delivery"" Promotion

Instacart often advertised ""free delivery"" to new consumers on their first three orders, insinuating the absence of additional fees. This promotion was alleged to be false, as every order placed for delivery requires additional ""service fees"" to be paid for consumers to get their items delivered. In the complaint, the FTC stated that Instacart misrepresented certain charges by another name, despite functioning the same as delivery fees, whether they were service fees or small order add-ons. Both are related to delivery, with Instacart using them to offset costs.

There was an alleged failure to prominently disclose that service fees may apply, and consumers would only see this upon reaching the checkout screen at the end. Instacart's own internal research found that consumers felt this offer to be a ""bait and switch,"" with many users spending significant time on orders only to be met with hidden fees.

""100% Satisfaction Guarantee"" Protection

Instacart advertises that consumers can receive a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a refund if they are not fully satisfied with their services. This has been alleged to be misleading, as many consumers who were seeking refunds — e.g., for late deliveries — received appeasement in forms of credit that can only be used for future orders instead of original payment. The amount refunded was also almost always less than what the customer originally paid.

Per the written terms of Instacart's guarantee, it is only applicable to the fees paid on the order instead of the total cost. Previously, customers were able to access a self-service interface on Instacart's website and mobile app to report issues with orders and receive refunds without having to contact customer service. In 2022, the refund option was hidden to shift more consumers toward credits rather than refunding to the original form of payment.

Unlawful ""Free Trials"" into Paid Instacart+ Memberships

Instacart has a membership available for purchase, Instacart+, which allows for members to receive $0 delivery fees on orders over $10. Plans include a $99 annual membership and a monthly membership of $9.99 per month. To further entice consumers, Instacart provides several free trials, one specifically taking place for 14 days. Aside from the fine print at the bottom of screens on the mobile platform, there is no specific distinction on the amount that will be charged once the free trial ends, often it being the $99 annual membership.

The fine print ensures consumers that they can ""cancel anytime,"" yet when consumers realize they have been charged for a full membership without their consent and attempt to cancel it, they do not receive refunds despite not having placed any orders after being charged. The FTC asserted that there is no clear distinction of which membership is going to be charged and no consensual way for consumers to agree to continuing their subscription after the trial.

Next Steps for Instacart

Instacart has agreed to pay $60 million in refunds to settle the claims; the funds will be routed into a refund program and distributed to consumers who were charged misleading fees or enrolled in Instacart's recurring membership without clear consent. The FTC has stated that this payout will reach hundreds of thousands of affected customers, representing the wide-scale impact of Instacart's practices over many years.

Additionally, under the FTC's proposed settlement order, Instacart will be prohibited from making future misrepresentations about delivery costs, service fees, and guarantees per refunds, and will no longer be able to automatically enroll customers in paid memberships unless they opt in. Instacart has also been asked to bar its pricing tools driven by AI and various algorithms to ensure customers see accurate totals ""at a time when families are working hard to stretch their grocery budgets.""

Future Moves for Tech Companies and Consumer Protection

Consumer advocacy groups support the FTC's action, arguing that it demonstrates the continued relevance of traditional consumer protection laws as AI is developed. They emphasize that AI-enabled systems can increase harm at scale as well as the need for enforcement when deceptive practices are automated or personalized, signifying that companies must proactively audit AI tools for consumer harm to prevent such risks.

In contrast, several industry stakeholders and innovation-focused policy groups warn that aggressive enforcement could slow AI adoption and experimentation. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal and other pro-market commentators argue that algorithmic pricing tests and personalized user experiences are tools that can increase efficiency and consumer choice if properly deployed. They prefer federal guidance over enforcement-driven regulation surrounding AI compliance, with concerns that over-regulation may deter investment and disadvantage US companies in global competition.

Legal and policy experts argue that while the White House's AI Action Plan emphasizes deregulation and national competitiveness, it does not preempt agencies like the FTC from applying established statutes to AI-enabled conduct. The Tech Policy Press stated that it ""stifles local initiatives to uphold civil rights and shield communities from biased AI systems."" Companies are often then faced with dual options of fewer AI-specific rules but continued exposure to enforcement under general consumer protection standards.

Ultimately, the FTC's settlement order of Instacart highlights the unresolved tension at the center of AI governance and how best to encourage innovation and efficiency without eroding basic consumer protections. As pro-market voices caution that aggressive enforcement can impact beneficial experimentation, the FTC's action affirms that automation does not absolve companies of transparency, consent, or fairness obligations.

Real talk: is A stock a game-changer or just background noise in your portfolio?

The internet is sleeping on Agilent Technologies Inc – but should you? While everyone chases the next meme coin or AI rocket, this lab-tech heavyweight is quietly powering pharma, biotech, semis, and more. Real talk: is A stock actually worth your money, or just boomer science vibes?

We pulled fresh market data, checked multiple finance sources, and scanned the social feeds so you do not have to. Here is what is really going on with Agilent right now.

Stock data check: Based on live data pulled on 2026-01-05 around 20:00 UTC, Agilent Technologies Inc (ticker: A) was trading near the mid 140s in USD, with a market cap hovering in the tens of billions. Figures were cross-checked using at least two major finance platforms. If markets are closed when you read this, treat that as a last known zone, not a current quote.

The Hype is Real: Agilent Technologies Inc on TikTok and Beyond

Agilent is not some flashy consumer gadget brand, so you will not see unboxing videos every five seconds. But zoom in on nerd-Tok, biotech-Tok, and finance creators, and you start seeing a pattern: people who know what this company actually does are taking it seriously.

Think of Agilent as the backstage crew for the entire science show. Their instruments and software help drug makers test new meds, chip producers measure microscopic defects, and labs everywhere keep their data clean and legit. It is not viral on its own – but everything viral in health and tech kind of runs through companies like this.

Social clout right now is more “respect” than “hype-beast”. You are not getting the explosive virality of the latest AI darling, but there is a steady stream of analysts, engineers, and lab creators calling Agilent a “must-have backbone” for serious research and production.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So, is Agilent Technologies Inc a game-changer or a total flop for your portfolio? Let us break it down into three key angles you actually care about.

1. The Business Model: Picks-and-Shovels to Science

Agilent sells the stuff everyone else needs to do the cool things. Instruments, diagnostics, software, lab tools. Instead of trying to guess which single drug, chip, or therapy wins, Agilent gets paid by the companies fighting those battles.

This “picks-and-shovels” vibe means: when biotech, semis, and advanced materials are booming, Agilent can quietly ride multiple waves at once. It is less about going viral and more about being impossible to skip in high-end labs.

2. Price Performance: Is It Worth the Hype?

Recent share price action for A has lived in that classic quality-stock pattern: pullbacks when the market panics about rates or funding for biotech, followed by slow, stubborn comebacks when earnings show the underlying demand is still there.

Here is the real talk: this is not a lottery ticket. You are paying up for quality, stability, and long-term relevance. The valuation is usually not dirt cheap, but dips and corrections can turn it into a no-brainer for long-term holders who are fine skipping the day-trading drama.

If you are chasing a quick viral spike, this probably is not it. If you are cool stacking a science-backed, cash-generating name and letting time cook, it starts to look a lot more attractive.

3. Risk Level: Boring or Beautiful?

Agilent’s risk is more about macro and sector cycles than the company suddenly vanishing. If funding for pharma, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing slows down, lab budgets get tight and orders can slip. That is when the stock usually feels heavy.

But when innovation spending ramps back up – new drugs, new chips, new testing needs – companies like Agilent often quietly rebound. It is less roller coaster, more long, bumpy upward hike.

So is it worth the hype? If your hype is defined as stable growth, science exposure, and compounding… then yes. If your hype means moonshot overnight, then not really.

Agilent Technologies Inc vs. The Competition

No stock lives in a vacuum, and Agilent has some serious rivals in the high-end lab-tech game. Think Thermo Fisher, Danaher, Waters, and a few other heavy-hitters.

Thermo Fisher is the big boss in this space – massive scale, deep product lines, huge reputation. When investors want “lab-tech blue chip,” TMO is often their first thought.

Clout War:

Thermo Fisher wins on name recognition and sheer size. Agilent wins on being a bit more focused, slightly more agile, and heavily tied to precision instruments and analytics that labs obsessed with data quality love.

Innovation Energy:

Both companies pour cash into R&D, but Agilent’s edge shows up in specialized analytical tools, chromatography, mass spec, and lab software that power serious research workflows. In the nerd corners of Reddit and professional forums, you will see real debates about whose instruments people prefer – and Agilent regularly gets love for usability and reliability.

Who Wins?

If you want the mega-conglomerate, all-in-one lab empire, Thermo Fisher probably wins. If you want a leaner, more instrument-and-analytics-focused play with strong margins and a bit more under-the-radar upside, Agilent has serious appeal.

From a clout angle, Thermo is the mainstream headliner. Agilent is the cult-favorite artist with a loyal fanbase. And sometimes, that cult favorite has the better performance upside when the crowd finally catches on.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So where do we land on Agilent Technologies Inc as an investment and as a hype play?

Social Sentiment: Not viral in the TikTok-sense, but strong respect among pros, finance creators, and science channels. This is more “must-have infrastructure” than “trending toy.”

Game-Changer Level: For your daily life? You might never touch an Agilent product. For the labs building the future of medicine, chips, and materials? Huge. Their tech is core to how experiments get done and verified.

Price Drop Potential: When the macro mood turns risk-off or funding fears hit biotech and semis, Agilent can see pullbacks. Those dips are when long-term investors quietly start circling.

Real Talk Verdict:

If you want fast thrills: probably a drop.

If you want a long-term, quality, science-backed name that benefits from multiple innovation trends without having to pick one winner: strong cop, especially on weakness.

This is the opposite of a meme stock: slow, serious, compounder energy. If that fits your strategy, Agilent deserves a hard look.

The Business Side: A

Time to talk pure market facts on Agilent Technologies Inc, ticker A, ISIN US00846U1016.

Recent trading action has the stock sitting in that mid-to-upper quality range: not penny stock cheap, not mega-cap stretched, but very much in the lane of a mature, profitable science company that the market already respects.

Analysts generally frame Agilent as a steady compounder rather than a moon mission. Revenue streams are spread across multiple end markets – pharma and biotech, diagnostics, chemicals, environment, and advanced manufacturing. That mix gives the business some defense when one vertical slows down.

On the fundamentals side, investors usually highlight:

Healthy margins for a hardware-plus-software business.

Recurring revenue from consumables, services, and software – not just one-off instrument sales.

Solid balance sheet vibes compared with more speculative tech names.

For US-based investors, A is a classic “own a slice of the lab infrastructure” move. You are not betting on one pill, one chip design, or one hot AI app – you are backing the toolbox companies use to build and test all of that.

If you are building a portfolio around themes like healthcare innovation, semiconductor quality, clean tech, or advanced materials, Agilent deserves a seat at the table. It might not trend on your FYP, but it could quietly trend in your portfolio statement over the long haul.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405030_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:03:09.977101

In Mexico, Walmart’s Cashi already had scale. What it needed next was the kind of regulated payments infrastructure that cannot be built overnight. Rather than rely on a global incumbent, Walmart acquired Trafalgar Asset Management’s (TAM) fintech arm, Trafalgar Digital, and used it to strengthen Cashi’s financial stack.

Among the firms building regulated, tech-first financial platforms in Mexico, TAM stands out.

In recent years, TAM has expanded beyond traditional investment activity to build infrastructure, governance and data capabilities that translate into practical financial services.

Through disciplined partnerships and incremental capability builds, rather than rapid feature sprawl, TAM has helped widen access to modern financial services while keeping governance front and centre.

A platform built for SMEs and regulation

The investor group, steered by Porfirio Sánchez-Talavera, has built a platform approach anchored in regulated infrastructure and scalable technology.

Across TAM’s fintech arm (Trafalgar Digital) and neobanking arm (Trafalgar SFP), the group applies AI, data analytics and automation to improve decisioning and customer experience, without compromising human oversight and regulatory discipline.

Trafalgar’s initiative to enhance its capabilities was undertaken with a particular demographic in mind.

Rather than casting a wide net, the firm focused on building infrastructure tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

SMEs often face higher friction as slower underwriting, limited product fit and higher cost of capital, makes speed, data quality and governance decisive.

From local infrastructure to scalable impact

This specialisation enabled the group to pursue licensing and supervision with Mexico’s banking and securities regulator (CNBV).

The groundwork supported the launch of Trafalgar SFP as a SOFIPO, broadening the group’s ability to serve SMEs by providing access to formal credit and long-term growth pathways.

That strategy paid off. In April 2023, Walmart acquired Trafalgar Digital, integrating a regulated platform into Cashi’s fintech strategy and accelerating services such as real-time SPEI transfers.

By October 2025, Trafalgar SFP began operating as an authorised SOFIPO.

Trafalgar’s trajectory acts as a blueprint for scaling financial services through modern infrastructure and regulatory discipline, a model recognised in 2025 with shortlisting in two Banking Tech Awards categories, including Best Use of Tech in SME Banking.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8027e75518bb8aed5a1cb0b654ba0d11:9cce214811bf409d2e01de4528228ee2/trafalgar-building.jpeg.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 09:02:22.056435

In accordance with TORM plc's articles of association (""Articles""), the Board of Directors has today determined that the threshold date defined in the Articles (being the first time at which Oaktree and its affiliates have ceased to beneficially own at least one third of the issued shares, excluding any shares held in treasury) has occurred and is therefore set at today.

Shares of tax preparation company H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) jumped 3% in the afternoon session after investors wagered geopolitical tension would be contained following the U.S. military's operation in Venezuela, with the Dow hitting a fresh record.

Sentiment remained firmly ""risk-on"" for early 2026, with Wall Street prioritizing domestic economic strength over foreign turbulence. Analysts noted that while the event raises short-term supply questions, the market largely viewed the potential stabilization of Venezuela's vast oil reserves as a long-term economic positive.

The shares closed the day at $43.71, up 2.6% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

H&R Block’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 5 months ago when the stock dropped 6% on the news that the company reported mixed second-quarter results, as an earnings miss and weaker-than-expected guidance for the upcoming fiscal year overshadowed a slight revenue beat.

The tax preparation company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, well below analyst expectations of $2.83. Although revenue came in slightly ahead of forecasts at $1.11 billion, the focus remained on profitability. The earnings miss was partly due to a one-time tax benefit of $0.50 per share being pushed to the next quarter. Looking ahead, H &R Block's earnings forecast for fiscal 2026 of $4.85 to $5.00 per share also fell short of consensus estimates.

H&R Block is up 2.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $43.71 per share, it is still trading 30.7% below its 52-week high of $63.04 from April 2025.

In Las Vegas on Monday, the ride-hailing company announced that it was developing a driverless robotaxi prototype with EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle company Nuro.

While not as futuristic as Tesla’s Cybercab concept or Amazon’s Zoox, which has no steering wheel, the still unnamed Uber-designed version of Lucid’s Gravity EV is expected to arrive in the San Francisco Bay Area at some point this year. It’ll join Waymo and Zoox robotaxis already on the road there. The companies said that on-road testing started at the end of last year, which isn’t surprising as Nuro already holds driverless testing permits through the California DMV. In fact, Nuro-branded autonomous vehicles started popping up on San Francisco streets last month.

Eventually, the trio plan to offer the Level 4 robotaxi prototype everywhere Uber has a presence — if all goes well, that is.

Monday’s big announcement provided us with the first look at what the prototype, which at its core is a repurposed Lucid Gravity, could look like. At first glance, the prototype takes advantage of Nuro’s autonomous last-mile delivery know-how and Nvidia’s Drive Hyperion platform for real-time AI processing.

The passenger experience is indeed a combination of all the companies involved in this robotaxi project. Inside it looks like the Gravity, which seats up to six adults and has a large hatchback trunk for luggage, but has some robotaxi hallmarks like touchscreens, which allow you to customize the ride and control the interior climate, activate heated seats, and set music choices. In terms of support, the car features an autonomous vehicle customer support button and emergency stop setting.

In addition, the screens show passengers what the robotaxi sees on the road—similar to the way Waymo shows pedestrians, traffic signals, and other cars—all in real-time.

Less noticeable is the prototype’s sensor suite, which includes high-res cameras, solid-state LiDAR sensors, and radars. The sensors are built into the Gravity exterior and more visible on the roof, where it looks like a roof rack is riding on top of the Gravity.

Lights on this roof rack sensor unit will light up with different colors, display passenger initials (just like Waymo), and provide status updates, the companies said.

Missing from the announcement was more information about how customers could hail one of these robotaxis or get access to the cars once they start production. If I had to bet, I imagine that everything will be tied into the existing Uber app.

The robotaxi prototype is expected to be built at Lucid’s Arizona factory at some point later this year. Of course, it’ll have to pass autonomous validation benchmarks first before being deployed.

With Monday’s announcement, Uber’s efforts (and notorious failures) to take on autonomous driving on its own are officially gone.

ID38,Ralph Lauren,2026-01-06 11:03:15+00:00,Modern Retail,Why the AI shopping agent wars will heat up in 2026 - Modern Retail,Allison Smith,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/technology/why-the-ai-shopping-agent-wars-will-heat-up-in-2026/,"But throughout 2025, new AI shopping agents sprouted left and right.
Alongside the big tech players, a wave of niche AI shopping startups emerged in 2025.
To win the AI agent shopping race, platforms will need to win over customers.
For those reasons, AI shopping startups with a specialized focus like Daydream may have a competitive edge against more mainstream AI tools heading into 2026.
Ultimately, the biggest hurdle facing any AI agent will be consumer adoption, according to Swap’s Pellerano-Rendón.","That dilemma is what led Bornstein to create Daydream, an AI-powered shopping platform focused on fashion. Daydream, which is still in beta, launched in June, a year after the company announced $50 million in seed funding. The platform lets users describe what they’re looking for in conversational language — or by uploading a photo — and receive personalized product recommendations in response.

Daydream is one of a growing number of tech startups, retailers and brands racing to hand off parts of the shopping journey to AI-powered agents — tools designed to research, recommend and, in some cases, buy products on a consumer’s behalf. In 2025, nearly every major retailer or AI incumbent entered the race for “agentic” commerce. Amazon expanded its Rufus shopping assistant with a new automatic-buying feature; OpenAI embedded checkout directly into ChatGPT; and Perplexity rolled out an AI-powered browser that prompted legal pushback from Amazon over how it accessed its site.

If 2025 was the year that companies laid the groundwork for agentic commerce, then 2026 will be the year retailers, tech giants and startups jockey to determine whose AI agent becomes the default interface for shopping — if consumers even adopt these AI agents en masse at all.

“We’re pre–Sputnik launch phase,” said Juan Pellerano-Rendón, chief marketing officer at e-commerce software startup Swap, which launched a new platform in September that creates AI shopping agents for brands to offer on their sites. “Everyone is building the spaceship, but no one has really launched it yet.”

Winning the buy box

Perplexity got a head start in the agentic shopping race when it unveiled an AI shopping agent for its U.S. subscribers in November 2024 that lets paying users research and buy products directly within Perplexity’s app or website.

But throughout 2025, new AI shopping agents sprouted left and right. Since September, OpenAI has announced several deals with major retailers — the latest partners include Target, Instacart and DoorDash — to let shoppers buy from their platforms directly within ChatGPT. Amazon released an agentic tool called “Buy For Me” that lets consumers shop other brands’ and retailers’ websites without leaving Amazon’s app. Even brands, including luxury players like Ralph Lauren, are launching their own AI-powered shopping assistants.

Alongside the big tech players, a wave of niche AI shopping startups emerged in 2025. New apps like Phia, a price-comparison platform co-founded by Phoebe Gates, and OneOff, which recommends products based on celebrity and creator looks, are targeting specific shopping use cases rather than trying to do everything at once. Even as these startups face competition from AI giants like OpenAI, investor interest remains strong. Phia, for instance, raised $8 million in September.

It’s still early days, and for the time being, shopping only accounts for a fraction of overall AI use. According to a working paper authored by OpenAI’s Economic Research team and a Harvard economist, around 2% of all ChatGPT queries are shopping-related — things like “recommend a laptop under $1,000” and “how much are running shoes.” Still, that comes to around 50 million shopping queries daily. Even a sliver of that activity could translate into enormous volume at scale.

The allure of agentic shopping is easy to understand. Online shopping has become overwhelming, with millions of products spread across multiple retailers, marketplaces and DTC sites, plus endless filters, ads and reviews to sort through. An AI agent, in theory, promises a shortcut: Instead of clicking around, shoppers can describe what they’re looking for in a sentence or two and get a short list of options that fit their needs. The idea is that the agent handles the busywork — weighing price, availability and quality — so shoppers can move more quickly toward a purchase.

To win the AI agent shopping race, platforms will need to win over customers. To some extent, that may give companies like OpenAI and Amazon an advantage because they can introduce agentic commerce features inside products consumers already use habitually. OpenAI announced in October that ChatGPT has reached 800 million weekly active users, up from 500 million in March. Meanwhile, Amazon captures 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, and 90% of its shoppers begin their searches directly on Amazon.com.

Scot Wingo, author of the Substack Retailgentic and founder of ReFiBuy, a company that helps brands and retailers optimize for agentic AI, said the quality of agents’ product recommendations will ultimately determine which platforms gain consumer trust. “GenAI knows far more about the shopper than Google ever did; the job now is to expand and contextualize the product catalog so the engine can map that shopper context to the right SKU,” he said. “There’s a big gap between tight, keywordy product catalogs and the context GenAI needs.”

In other words, shopping agents are only as good as the data they can access — and that’s where things get complicated. To make accurate recommendations, agents need more granular and standardized information — not just basic attributes, but detailed descriptions of fit, quality, durability, shipping timelines and inventory status. For decades, merchants have structured their product catalogs around search engine optimization, designed to match short, keyword-based queries rather than long, descriptive requests.

Shoppers now give AI agents far more context — dozens of words about who they are, how they’ll use a product and what they prefer — but most product catalogs were never built to absorb or respond to that level of detail. Closing that gap would require brands to add far richer context to every product, a labor-intensive process that goes well beyond basic fields like price or size. And some of the information agents would need is considered proprietary, so some merchants may be reluctant to share it with third-party AI platforms.

“Even if these agents don’t bother with the transaction and just offer themselves up as an alternative to Google search, there is still a lot of creating new information in new formats for each product that every merchant will need to do,” said Sucharita Kodali, a principal analyst at Forrester. “There will no doubt be holdouts.”

That tension is already shaping how the agentic shopping market is developing. Unlike many other retailers that have inked partnerships with third-party AI companies like OpenAI, Amazon has blocked off its site from outside agents. The move was likely intended to protect its $56 billion advertising business, which depends on shoppers browsing Amazon’s site, Modern Retail previously reported. Earlier this year, Amazon sued Perplexity, arguing that the AI startup improperly accessed its site, a legal fight that underscored how high the stakes have become as platforms jockey to control the future of AI-driven commerce.

But while the rise of AI shopping agents from ChatGPT to Daydream challenges Amazon, the e-commerce giant doesn’t need to worry about its retail empire being upended just yet, according to Kodali. That’s because Amazon already has stored payment credentials, consumer trust and habitual usage. In a July survey of 700 consumers conducted by Forrester, only about a third said they would be willing to complete payment through an answer engine at all, citing data privacy concerns.

To gain traction with consumers, and compete with the likes of Amazon, AI companies like OpenAI “need to get shoppers on board and convince them that it’s better to buy on ChatGPT than on a retailer’s website, which usually a third party can only do if the assortment is bigger or if the products are cheaper,” Kodali said. “So long as Amazon is a player in e-commerce, I don’t see ChatGPT ever winning the buy box over Amazon.”

Not the finish line

Building an AI agent specifically for shopping is no easy feat. Users shop with nuanced, conversational requests — “a dress for a wedding in Paris in the fall,” for example — which involve interpreting multiple factors — occasion, seasonality, location, style, color, fabric, price point and more, sometimes in a single query, Bornstein said. Standard LLMs struggle to reliably extract all pertinent details at once, often omitting or misinterpreting elements.

Indeed, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy recently told analysts that most AI shopping agents fail to provide a satisfactory customer experience. He said most lack personalization and often provide inaccurate pricing and delivery estimates. “We’ve got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange of value,” he said in October. Bloomberg reported that product recommendations from Amazon’s Rufus, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Walmart’s Sparky elicited fairly generic results when asked what to buy mom for Christmas.

Rather than relying on keyword searches or static filters, Daydream uses multiple AI models to interpret factors like occasion, seasonality and personal style. For those reasons, AI shopping startups with a specialized focus like Daydream may have a competitive edge against more mainstream AI tools heading into 2026. Bornstein declined to share revenue figures, but she said the platform’s catalog includes nearly 2 million products spanning more than 8,000 brands.

Ultimately, the biggest hurdle facing any AI agent will be consumer adoption, according to Swap’s Pellerano-Rendón. “There’s no innovation without utility,” he said, arguing that agents won’t improve unless consumers see enough value to keep using them. Right now, he said, the industry is stuck in a “chicken or egg phase,” where “the agent needs to get better, but also the consumers need to use it for it to get better.” Until shoppers consistently experience moments where an agent truly understands what they want — what he described as a “needle in the haystack feeling” — adoption will remain slow. “We’re still super, super early days, in terms of how people are using agents to shop,” he said.

Bornstein agreed.

“It’s going to take longer to perfect these experiences than anyone thinks,” she said. “It will happen, but 2026 will be a step along the way, not the finish line.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/Agentic-AI-.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:04:14.544435

The S&P Global UK services PMI business activity index edged higher to 51.4 points in December from 51.3 in November, but underperformed against the flash reading of 52.1.

The reading remained above the neutral 50-point mark separating growth from contraction, and indicated a rise in business activity for the eighth successive month.

""Moreover, the speed of expansion was softer than signalled by the earlier 'flash' survey in December and lower than seen on average in the second half of the year.""

Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.
(Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)
Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year.
Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.","In another district or another time, Representative Daniel Goldman of New York City would probably coast to re-election for his safely Democratic seat.

He is a well-spoken former prosecutor with liberal bona fides and a vast personal fortune. He won plaudits as the House’s chief investigator during President Trump’s first impeachment, and could reprise that role if Democrats take back the chamber.

But as he formally begins his campaign for a third term on Tuesday, Mr. Goldman, 49, is instead girding for the fight of his political life as he faces a primary challenge from Brad Lander, a popular former city official.

These are not easy times to be a Democratic incumbent, after all. With Mr. Trump upending Washington and rattling the world order, the party’s voters are actively reconsidering how their leaders should fight back and what they should stand for on issues including the economy and Gaza.

Mr. Lander, 56, has spent weeks contending that Mr. Goldman’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza has defied the residents of his Brooklyn and Manhattan district, and that his lawyerly approach is too timid for the moment. The challenger has the backing of the city’s politically powerful new mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Now, Mr. Goldman is ready to have his say.

He will declare his candidacy on Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with a video highlighting his successes constraining Mr. Trump in court and Congress and his support for left-leaning policies like Medicare for All and a tax hike on the wealthy.

In an expansive interview over lunch at a diner in Manhattan’s Chinatown, Mr. Goldman pointed to a successful lawsuit he helped bring that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to grant members of Congress access to immigration holding cells as proof of concept.

“My approach to the job is to get results,” he said, “not revolutions.”

Mr. Goldman took swipes at Mr. Lander, arguing that his rival was only running for Congress as a fallback after Mr. Mamdani did not hire him for his administration. (Mr. Lander has rejected that suggestion.)

The congressman also questioned whether the activist tactics Mr. Lander had embraced — he was arrested last June at the immigration courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza while trying to escort a migrant facing detention — were actually effective.

“Civil disobedience is a very valid and important way to protest,” he said. “But I don’t know whether a single person has benefited from that other than perhaps Brad Lander, because he gets a lot of attention for it.”

And Mr. Goldman said he had resigned himself to the fact that his support for Israel, which he called central to his faith and his worldview, could come at a political cost as polls show Democratic opinions moving against the American ally after years of war.

“I understood that ran the risk of engendering a primary,” he said. But, he added that he had tried to make decisions around the conflict based on “what I genuinely thought was best for the state of Israel, the people of Israel, Palestinian civilians and the future state of Palestine.”

But the race between Mr. Goldman and Mr. Lander in New York’s 10th District may be among the highest wattage.

Connecting Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn, the district leans clearly to the left and voted decisively for Mr. Mamdani in November. It includes Wall Street, two Chinatowns, liberal affluent neighborhoods of brownstone Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park.

Mr. Goldman, a Levi Strauss heir with little background in city politics, narrowly won the seat in 2022, when he spent nearly $5 million of his own money and progressive support fractured among three other candidates.

Since then, he has had one of the most liberal voting records in Congress. Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.

His work on immigration has not been limited to court. He has turned his Lower Manhattan office, which sits just across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, into a triage center to help connect families of migrants who are detained with social and legal services.

“There are folks who believe that because of my presence there, far fewer arrests are made,” he said.

But progressives have always been wary of Mr. Goldman — of his wealth, his relatively shallow ties to community groups and, above all in recent years, his positions on Israel and the war in Gaza.

Mr. Goldman has repeatedly voted to send American military aid to Israel, and he declined to endorse Mr. Mamdani over concerns about his sharp criticism of the country. (Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)

Progressives were particularly upset when, not long after the war began, Mr. Goldman voted to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, for her statements relating to it.

Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year. Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.

But he has moved leftward with his party’s base, supporting putting conditions on certain U.S. military aid to Israel and blocking the transfer of bombs and other heavy weapons outright. More than two years after the war began, he started calling Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide, a position few other Jewish elected officials have taken.

Among Mr. Lander’s supporters is Assemblyman Robert Carroll, a Brooklyn Democrat who endorsed Mr. Goldman in 2022, and now calls that decision “one of the poorest choices I made.”

“He did not just turn a cold shoulder on his constituents,” Mr. Carroll said recently. “He told his constituents he knew better.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06met-goldman-01-wjmk/06met-goldman-01-wjmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:58:46.658101

Mukherji most recently served as Senior Vice President & Director, Strategy, Marketing & Communication, where he led the brand’s marketing efforts and digital transformation agenda, including the Digital Next programme, while shaping a focused and future-ready business strategy.

“After 21 incredible years at Nestlé, it’s time to close the chapter and move on,” Mukherji wrote in a recent LinkedIn post. “Thanks to all the wonderful people I have had the privilege to work with.”

Over the course of his career, Mukherji held leadership roles across Nestlé India and Nestlé S.A., working at a global level across multiple brands.

Reflecting on his stint as Global Head of Consumer & Marketplace Insights, Mukherji wrote, “My years as the Global Head of Consumer & Marketplace Insights soaked me into the opportunity to go to over 35 countries around the world, understand different realities and contexts, define and find solutions to different live business questions and problems.”

Earlier, as Director, Strategy, Marketing & Communication at Nestlé India, he played a key role in translating consumer understanding into brand value. “As Director, Strategy, Marketing, Communication of Nestlé India, I enjoyed every move that turned deep understanding into meaningful brand value for consumers we serve,” he noted.

Describing his time at the company as both professionally and personally significant, Mukherji highlighted the responsibility of working on brands with deep everyday relevance. “These brands are part of everyday life for millions, and being entrusted with their stewardship has been both humbling and energising,” he wrote.

Mukherji also acknowledged the agency and research partners he collaborated with over the years, including Publicis Groupe, Google, Meta, McCann, WPP, Ogilvy, Hogarth, VML, Kantar, Ipsos and Nielsen.

“I believe that the most meaningful leadership outcomes are never measured alone, the real impact happens fundamentally and quietly, ownership is everything, and success is a team sport,” he added.

He concluded by wishing his network “a strong and energised start to 2026.”

Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group Inc. maintained its lead in net premiums written (NPW), holding the position for the 11th consecutive year with $308.8 billion, up 6.2% in 2024.

Allianz SE, which had led the nonbanking assets ranking for five straight years, dropped to second place despite a 6.2% rise in assets to $1.09 trillion. The rest of the top five remained unchanged, with China Life Insurance (Group) Co., Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd., and Prudential Financial Inc. ranking third through fifth.

AM Best compiled the rankings using BestLink data and additional research, published in the January 2026 issue of Best’s Review. Analysts said Berkshire Hathaway’s rise in asset rankings reflects the growing scale and diversification of large multinational insurers, which may increase competitive pressure on smaller or regional carriers.

UnitedHealth’s continued dominance in premiums highlights the ongoing concentration of the US health insurance market, which could influence pricing and product strategies globally. Additionally, the combination of strong asset bases and premium growth among the top insurers may allow them to expand into new markets or invest in emerging risks such as cyber, climate, and specialty insurance lines.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/023/0382_639032863710129491.png,N,,2026-01-06 09:02:09.666162

Huang has already described robotics — including autonomous vehicles — as Nvidia’s second-most important growth category after AI itself.
GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale.","It’s hard to say whether Nvidia has ever truly been subtle with its announcements. At last year’s CES, CEO and founder Jensen Huang stunned the industry with the debut of the GeForce RTX 50 series alongside Nvidia Cosmos, its ambitious world-model initiative. This year’s show was more restrained on the consumer GPU front, but the message to CES 2026 attendees was still unmistakable: Nvidia wants it all.

""All"" isn't hyperbole. Nvidia is now the first company ever to surpass a $5 trillion valuation — an almost inconceivable figure — and Huang and company show no signs of slowing down. The company’s ambitions now span factories, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and nearly any domain that can be trained, tested, or perfected in simulation before ever touching the real world. If something can be modeled, Nvidia wants to power it.

Nvidia’s real obsession is physical AI

The biggest buzzword of the night was “physical AI,” Nvidia’s term for AI systems that don’t just generate content but actually act. These models are trained in virtual environments using synthetic data, then deployed into physical machines once they’ve learned how the world works.

Huang showcased Cosmos, a world foundation model capable of simulating environments and predicting movement, alongside Alpamayo, a reasoning model specifically designed for autonomous driving. This is the tech Nvidia says will power robots, industrial automation, and self-driving vehicles, as demonstrated by the Mercedes-Benz CLA, which was shown running AI-defined driving on stage. The company also revealed plans to test its own robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027, using Level 4 autonomous vehicles capable of driving without human intervention in limited regions.

Nvidia hasn’t announced where the service will launch or with whom it’s partnering, but the move signals a shift from being a behind-the-scenes supplier to actively participating in the self-driving race. Huang has already described robotics — including autonomous vehicles — as Nvidia’s second-most important growth category after AI itself.

No New GPUs

If you were waiting for new consumer GPUs, you probably noticed very quickly that there weren’t any. Nvidia didn’t announce a single new GeForce card, and that felt entirely intentional. Instead, Huang spent most of the keynote talking about Rubin, Nvidia’s next-generation AI platform that’s already in full production.

Rubin is described as more than just a chip, but an entire system. GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale. Nvidia framed this as essential to keeping up with skyrocketing AI demand, where training costs, energy use, and bottlenecks are becoming existential problems.

The absence of gaming hardware shouldn't be considered a snub, but it is clear that Nvidia is no longer driven by gamers. It's kind of been clear that's been the case for a while, but today's conference really drove the nail in the coffin. Instead, the company's ambitions are driven by hyperscalers, governments, and anyone trying to automate everything that moves.

'Open' AI, powered by Nvidia hardware

The third major takeaway was Nvidia’s ongoing push to make itself unavoidable through openness — or at least Nvidia’s version of it. Huang repeatedly emphasized that the company isn’t just selling hardware, but open AI models that developers can actually use, fine-tune, and deploy (not to be confused with ChatGPT developer OpenAI). Nvidia now has open models spanning healthcare, climate science, robotics, embodied intelligence, reasoning AI, and autonomous driving, all trained on Nvidia supercomputers and released as foundational building blocks. They've practically become the corn of tech.

Even personal AI agents got some stage time, with demos of local agents running on Nvidia’s DGX Spark hardware. Nvidia aims to be the platform beneath every AI system, from massive data centers to individual desktops. It’s an elegant strategy — sell openness, but still own the pipes.

Taken together, the keynote felt like a declaration. Nvidia isn’t chasing CES hype cycles any more. It’s positioning itself as the backbone of an AI-powered world, where the most important announcements don’t happen on stage, and the most impactful products aren’t meant to fit under your desk.",https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06Xo82tWDIYCfuZRGSYuhmu/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1767660808.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:01:04.830607

Prior to Jolt Digital, Tan spent more than four years at Publicis Media, where he held roles including APAC lead for Spark Foundry: M1, executive director of strategy and new business, and regional lead for Publicis Imagine. He has also held senior roles at Zenith, Neo@Ogilvy and Universal McCann.

Commenting on the appointment, Jessica Toh, CEO of The Media Shop Group, said the leadership move marks a key step in the company’s growth plans.

“This leadership evolution is a key step in our growth plan and highlights our commitment to strategic capabilities and synergy with our clients,” she said, adding that Tan’s experience across agency operations positions the group for continued growth in Asia.

Tan said, “The Media Shop is a leader amongst independent media agencies in Singapore and I am proud to be part of the leadership team driving the agency’s next chapter of growth."" He added that the agency is well positioned to capture regional growth opportunities through integrated planning, data-driven digital strategy and a client-centric approach.
