(HPQ) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","HP Inc. provides personal computing, printing, and other related technologies in the United States and internationally. Formerly known as Hewlett-Packard, the company changed its name in October 2015. It serves small- and medium-sized businesses, the public sector, and large enterprises.

Key challenges remain for HP in 2026 including changes in customer purchasing behavior and industry component availability. A difficult macroeconomic environment and lingering inflationary conditions do not bode well for the company’s outlook.

HP’s forecast for fiscal 2026 PC demand raises concerns regarding its growth prospects in the short-term. Management expects PC unit volumes to fall in the current year. Lower volumes and price pressures would make it harder to protect margins and meet earnings targets.

The computing giant faces stiff competition for its PC and printer businesses. The PC segment competes with the likes of Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and Acer. In the latest quarter, print revenues fell 4% year-over-year as office demand in North America and Europe remained soft. The print segment will likely continue to face structural challenges as customers reduce printing volumes and shift to digital workflows.

The Zacks Rundown

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, HP HPQ is a component of the Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 14% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.

Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be intriguing short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they’re part of a lagging industry, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.

HPQ shares have been underperforming the market over the past year. The stock is trading near a 52-week low even as the major U.S. indexes hover near all-time highs.

Recent Earnings Misses & Deteriorating Outlook

HP has fallen short of earnings estimates in four of the past six quarters. The technology company posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -2.6%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and HP is no exception.

The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking at the current fiscal year, analysts have slashed estimates by -9.64% in the past 60 days. The FY2026 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $3.00 per share, reflecting negative growth of -3.9% relative to the prior year.

Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.

Technical Outlook

As illustrated below, HPQ stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has shown little in the way of a trend, widely underperforming the major indices. Also note that shares are trading below downward-sloping 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages – another good sign for the bears.

Image Source: StockCharts

HPQ stock has experienced what is known as a “death cross,” whereby the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Shares would have to make an outsized move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. The stock has fallen more than 30% in the past year alone.

Final Thoughts

A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way to new highs anytime soon. The fact that HPQ stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns.

A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.

Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of HP until the situation shows major signs of improvement.

The FTC sued Instacart for deceptive practices including misleading ""free delivery,"" unclear satisfaction guarantees, undisclosed fees, and unlawful free-trial-to-paid memberships. Instacart has now reached a $60 million settlement to refund hundreds of thousands of consumers and impose future compliance restrictions.

Investigations found that Instacart's algorithmic pricing experiments led to significant price disparities (up to 23% higher for some users), exacerbating consumer frustration amid already high grocery prices and raising concerns about fairness and transparency.

The case reinforces that traditional consumer protection laws apply to AI-enabled markets. While the White House's AI Action Plan promotes innovation and minimal new regulation, it preserves FTC authority to enforce transparency, consent, and fairness in automated systems.

The action highlights a growing divide between consumer advocates, who argue automated and personalized systems can scale consumer harm and require strong enforcement, and industry groups, who warn that aggressive enforcement may chill AI innovation, investment, and competitive experimentation.

FTC's Settlement Action Against Instacart Reinforces Need for AI Systems Regulation

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Instacart for engaging in numerous deceptive tactics against consumers through unclear labels and disclosures, resulting in raised grocery prices and recurring memberships without consent. Instacart has agreed to settle through paying $60 million in refunds to affected customers.

Other internal and external research had already shown how Instacart's AI-driven pricing experiments impacted various family budgets. It was found that some quoted prices to consumers were up to approximately 23% higher than those shown to others, even for the same cart and time.

This AI-powered pricing tool, known as Eversight, allows for retailers to conduct price tests to gauge reactions of consumers and efficiency to higher and lower prices across different categories of items. Instacart's website noted that grocers who use this tool ""see revenue growth of 1 to 3%."" Instacart claimed these tests were randomized and, among other companies utilizing this tool, was scrutinized, emphasizing that ""consumers deserve to know when they are being placed into pricing tests. The FTC should require a prominent on-screen label,"" as stated by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The practice of dynamic pricing raised concerns and increased consumer frustration with grocery prices already being at significantly higher levels. Reports from several nonprofit consumer advocacy groups found that the prices of items in Instacart baskets varied by an average of 7% across 437 shoppers in four cities testing for the same items at the same stores. Shortly after, the FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand for further information on Eversight.

This recent enforcement action against Instacart is an example of how traditional consumer protection principles continue to apply in increasingly automated and technology-driven markets. It reinforces that representations made and marketed to consumers about pricing, fees, or savings must be transparent, regardless of them being generated or influenced by algorithms or other advanced technologies.

The AI Action Plan released by the White House this past summer, while emphasizing the importance of fostering innovation and competition in artificial intelligence, does not carve out exemptions from existing consumer protection laws. It explicitly preserves and reinforces the role of agencies such as the FTC in addressing unfair or deceptive practices involving AI-enabled systems, as we previously covered. The enforcement action is grounded in traditional consumer protection law by addressing false advertising, undisclosed fees, and unfair practices harming shoppers. In contrast, the AI Action Plan leans toward market-friendly AI adoption and minimal federal constraints, leaving Big Tech and startups to consider how AI systems interact with consumer rights.

In the complaint, three components of Instacart's deceptive tactics were highlighted:

""Free Delivery"" Promotion

Instacart often advertised ""free delivery"" to new consumers on their first three orders, insinuating the absence of additional fees. This promotion was alleged to be false, as every order placed for delivery requires additional ""service fees"" to be paid for consumers to get their items delivered. In the complaint, the FTC stated that Instacart misrepresented certain charges by another name, despite functioning the same as delivery fees, whether they were service fees or small order add-ons. Both are related to delivery, with Instacart using them to offset costs.

There was an alleged failure to prominently disclose that service fees may apply, and consumers would only see this upon reaching the checkout screen at the end. Instacart's own internal research found that consumers felt this offer to be a ""bait and switch,"" with many users spending significant time on orders only to be met with hidden fees.

""100% Satisfaction Guarantee"" Protection

Instacart advertises that consumers can receive a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a refund if they are not fully satisfied with their services. This has been alleged to be misleading, as many consumers who were seeking refunds — e.g., for late deliveries — received appeasement in forms of credit that can only be used for future orders instead of original payment. The amount refunded was also almost always less than what the customer originally paid.

Per the written terms of Instacart's guarantee, it is only applicable to the fees paid on the order instead of the total cost. Previously, customers were able to access a self-service interface on Instacart's website and mobile app to report issues with orders and receive refunds without having to contact customer service. In 2022, the refund option was hidden to shift more consumers toward credits rather than refunding to the original form of payment.

Unlawful ""Free Trials"" into Paid Instacart+ Memberships

Instacart has a membership available for purchase, Instacart+, which allows for members to receive $0 delivery fees on orders over $10. Plans include a $99 annual membership and a monthly membership of $9.99 per month. To further entice consumers, Instacart provides several free trials, one specifically taking place for 14 days. Aside from the fine print at the bottom of screens on the mobile platform, there is no specific distinction on the amount that will be charged once the free trial ends, often it being the $99 annual membership.

The fine print ensures consumers that they can ""cancel anytime,"" yet when consumers realize they have been charged for a full membership without their consent and attempt to cancel it, they do not receive refunds despite not having placed any orders after being charged. The FTC asserted that there is no clear distinction of which membership is going to be charged and no consensual way for consumers to agree to continuing their subscription after the trial.

Next Steps for Instacart

Instacart has agreed to pay $60 million in refunds to settle the claims; the funds will be routed into a refund program and distributed to consumers who were charged misleading fees or enrolled in Instacart's recurring membership without clear consent. The FTC has stated that this payout will reach hundreds of thousands of affected customers, representing the wide-scale impact of Instacart's practices over many years.

Additionally, under the FTC's proposed settlement order, Instacart will be prohibited from making future misrepresentations about delivery costs, service fees, and guarantees per refunds, and will no longer be able to automatically enroll customers in paid memberships unless they opt in. Instacart has also been asked to bar its pricing tools driven by AI and various algorithms to ensure customers see accurate totals ""at a time when families are working hard to stretch their grocery budgets.""

Future Moves for Tech Companies and Consumer Protection

Consumer advocacy groups support the FTC's action, arguing that it demonstrates the continued relevance of traditional consumer protection laws as AI is developed. They emphasize that AI-enabled systems can increase harm at scale as well as the need for enforcement when deceptive practices are automated or personalized, signifying that companies must proactively audit AI tools for consumer harm to prevent such risks.

In contrast, several industry stakeholders and innovation-focused policy groups warn that aggressive enforcement could slow AI adoption and experimentation. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal and other pro-market commentators argue that algorithmic pricing tests and personalized user experiences are tools that can increase efficiency and consumer choice if properly deployed. They prefer federal guidance over enforcement-driven regulation surrounding AI compliance, with concerns that over-regulation may deter investment and disadvantage US companies in global competition.

Legal and policy experts argue that while the White House's AI Action Plan emphasizes deregulation and national competitiveness, it does not preempt agencies like the FTC from applying established statutes to AI-enabled conduct. The Tech Policy Press stated that it ""stifles local initiatives to uphold civil rights and shield communities from biased AI systems."" Companies are often then faced with dual options of fewer AI-specific rules but continued exposure to enforcement under general consumer protection standards.

Ultimately, the FTC's settlement order of Instacart highlights the unresolved tension at the center of AI governance and how best to encourage innovation and efficiency without eroding basic consumer protections. As pro-market voices caution that aggressive enforcement can impact beneficial experimentation, the FTC's action affirms that automation does not absolve companies of transparency, consent, or fairness obligations.

In accordance with TORM plc's articles of association (""Articles""), the Board of Directors has today determined that the threshold date defined in the Articles (being the first time at which Oaktree and its affiliates have ceased to beneficially own at least one third of the issued shares, excluding any shares held in treasury) has occurred and is therefore set at today.

As the ownership stake held by Oaktree and its affiliates is now below the one-third threshold, the position and authority of the B-Director is extinguished. As a result, our Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director, David Weinstein, will leave the Board effective as of this date. The Board wishes to thank Mr. Weinstein for his support and dedication to the company and its associates since joining the Board in 2015. His experience and dedication have proven invaluable to the Board and to the Company. Upon his departure from the Board, the Company has retained Mr. Weinstein in an ongoing capacity as a Special Advisor to the Board.

Mr. Weinstein stated that: ""It has been a great privilege serving TORM through numerous transformative events and business cycles.

I am honored to have worked with such an extraordinary team. I am grateful for their trust and support and confident in the company's future success.""

The limitations on TORM plc's actions set out in Article 137 stop having effect immediately at the threshold date and no approvals will be needed other than any provided under the legislation for any reserved matter after that time.

The B- and C-shares are in the process of being redeemed and cancelled in accordance with the Articles and no further B- or C-shares can then be issued.

The C-share right to vote 350,000,000 shares has ceased as from the threshold date. The right of the B-share to one vote continues until it is redeemed. Therefore, from the threshold date, the voting rights are 101,332,707 A-shares and one B-share, each with one vote per share.

After the redemption/cancellation, TORM plc's share capital will amount to USD 1,013,327.07 divided into 101,332,707 A-shares of USD 0.01 each.

Shares of tax preparation company H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) jumped 3% in the afternoon session after investors wagered geopolitical tension would be contained following the U.S. military's operation in Venezuela, with the Dow hitting a fresh record.

Sentiment remained firmly ""risk-on"" for early 2026, with Wall Street prioritizing domestic economic strength over foreign turbulence. Analysts noted that while the event raises short-term supply questions, the market largely viewed the potential stabilization of Venezuela's vast oil reserves as a long-term economic positive.

The shares closed the day at $43.71, up 2.6% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

H&R Block’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 5 months ago when the stock dropped 6% on the news that the company reported mixed second-quarter results, as an earnings miss and weaker-than-expected guidance for the upcoming fiscal year overshadowed a slight revenue beat.

The tax preparation company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, well below analyst expectations of $2.83. Although revenue came in slightly ahead of forecasts at $1.11 billion, the focus remained on profitability. The earnings miss was partly due to a one-time tax benefit of $0.50 per share being pushed to the next quarter. Looking ahead, H &R Block's earnings forecast for fiscal 2026 of $4.85 to $5.00 per share also fell short of consensus estimates.

H&R Block is up 2.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $43.71 per share, it is still trading 30.7% below its 52-week high of $63.04 from April 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of H&R Block’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,761.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2026-01-06 08:13:33.379109

Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.
(Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)
Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year.
Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.","In another district or another time, Representative Daniel Goldman of New York City would probably coast to re-election for his safely Democratic seat.

He is a well-spoken former prosecutor with liberal bona fides and a vast personal fortune. He won plaudits as the House’s chief investigator during President Trump’s first impeachment, and could reprise that role if Democrats take back the chamber.

But as he formally begins his campaign for a third term on Tuesday, Mr. Goldman, 49, is instead girding for the fight of his political life as he faces a primary challenge from Brad Lander, a popular former city official.

These are not easy times to be a Democratic incumbent, after all. With Mr. Trump upending Washington and rattling the world order, the party’s voters are actively reconsidering how their leaders should fight back and what they should stand for on issues including the economy and Gaza.

Mr. Lander, 56, has spent weeks contending that Mr. Goldman’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza has defied the residents of his Brooklyn and Manhattan district, and that his lawyerly approach is too timid for the moment. The challenger has the backing of the city’s politically powerful new mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Now, Mr. Goldman is ready to have his say.

He will declare his candidacy on Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with a video highlighting his successes constraining Mr. Trump in court and Congress and his support for left-leaning policies like Medicare for All and a tax hike on the wealthy.

In an expansive interview over lunch at a diner in Manhattan’s Chinatown, Mr. Goldman pointed to a successful lawsuit he helped bring that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to grant members of Congress access to immigration holding cells as proof of concept.

“My approach to the job is to get results,” he said, “not revolutions.”

Mr. Goldman took swipes at Mr. Lander, arguing that his rival was only running for Congress as a fallback after Mr. Mamdani did not hire him for his administration. (Mr. Lander has rejected that suggestion.)

The congressman also questioned whether the activist tactics Mr. Lander had embraced — he was arrested last June at the immigration courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza while trying to escort a migrant facing detention — were actually effective.

“Civil disobedience is a very valid and important way to protest,” he said. “But I don’t know whether a single person has benefited from that other than perhaps Brad Lander, because he gets a lot of attention for it.”

And Mr. Goldman said he had resigned himself to the fact that his support for Israel, which he called central to his faith and his worldview, could come at a political cost as polls show Democratic opinions moving against the American ally after years of war.

“I understood that ran the risk of engendering a primary,” he said. But, he added that he had tried to make decisions around the conflict based on “what I genuinely thought was best for the state of Israel, the people of Israel, Palestinian civilians and the future state of Palestine.”

But the race between Mr. Goldman and Mr. Lander in New York’s 10th District may be among the highest wattage.

Connecting Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn, the district leans clearly to the left and voted decisively for Mr. Mamdani in November. It includes Wall Street, two Chinatowns, liberal affluent neighborhoods of brownstone Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park.

Mr. Goldman, a Levi Strauss heir with little background in city politics, narrowly won the seat in 2022, when he spent nearly $5 million of his own money and progressive support fractured among three other candidates.

Since then, he has had one of the most liberal voting records in Congress. Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.

His work on immigration has not been limited to court. He has turned his Lower Manhattan office, which sits just across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, into a triage center to help connect families of migrants who are detained with social and legal services.

“There are folks who believe that because of my presence there, far fewer arrests are made,” he said.

But progressives have always been wary of Mr. Goldman — of his wealth, his relatively shallow ties to community groups and, above all in recent years, his positions on Israel and the war in Gaza.

Mr. Goldman has repeatedly voted to send American military aid to Israel, and he declined to endorse Mr. Mamdani over concerns about his sharp criticism of the country. (Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)

Progressives were particularly upset when, not long after the war began, Mr. Goldman voted to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, for her statements relating to it.

Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year. Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.

But he has moved leftward with his party’s base, supporting putting conditions on certain U.S. military aid to Israel and blocking the transfer of bombs and other heavy weapons outright. More than two years after the war began, he started calling Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide, a position few other Jewish elected officials have taken.

Among Mr. Lander’s supporters is Assemblyman Robert Carroll, a Brooklyn Democrat who endorsed Mr. Goldman in 2022, and now calls that decision “one of the poorest choices I made.”

“He did not just turn a cold shoulder on his constituents,” Mr. Carroll said recently. “He told his constituents he knew better.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06met-goldman-01-wjmk/06met-goldman-01-wjmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:58:46.658101

That’s because some customers were accidentally overcharged as a result of a law coming into force on January 1.

Officials in Richmond County, Virginia, rolled out a new five-cent tax on disposable plastic bags.

But, shoppers in another county were slapped with the extra charge.

Walmart customers who shopped at stores in Henrico County were affected.

And, the supermarket chain has broken its silence.

“Some customers shopping at Walmart locations in Henrico County on Brook Rd, Forest Ave and N Parham Rd might have been mistakenly charged for Richmond City’s new 5-cent tax on disposable plastic bags starting Jan. 1, 2026,” a spokesperson told the ABC affiliate WRIC-TV.

“We’re providing refunds to customers in those cases.”

Matt Chafin, who works as a Henrico County official, also revealed some Dollar Tree and CVS shoppers were affected.

Other city and state officials implemented bag-related policies on January 1.

Montgomery County’s Bring Your Own Bag law came into force on New Year’s Day.

Shoppers in the Maryland county are now charged 10 cents per paper bag.

Grocery stores are no longer providing plastic bags to shoppers at the checkout.

Shoppers are encouraged to use reusable bags.

But, there are a limited set of circumstances where plastic bags will still be provided.

Plastic bags will be provided to shoppers who are buying meat and seafood products.

Some customers will not have to pay the 10-cent tax.

This applies to shoppers who receive SNAP benefits.

More than 41 million people across the US receive SNAP benefits, known as food stamps.

Single-use plastic bags are no longer available at stores across California.

Shoppers must either bring reusable bags or have to pay 10 cents for a paper carrier.

Officials in some Californian counties such as Napa warned retailers who ignored the ban risked hefty penalties.

Fines could start at $1,000 per day, capping at $5,000.

Officials in at least 12 states have rolled out some restrictions on plastic bags.

GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale.","It’s hard to say whether Nvidia has ever truly been subtle with its announcements. At last year’s CES, CEO and founder Jensen Huang stunned the industry with the debut of the GeForce RTX 50 series alongside Nvidia Cosmos, its ambitious world-model initiative. This year’s show was more restrained on the consumer GPU front, but the message to CES 2026 attendees was still unmistakable: Nvidia wants it all.

""All"" isn't hyperbole. Nvidia is now the first company ever to surpass a $5 trillion valuation — an almost inconceivable figure — and Huang and company show no signs of slowing down. The company’s ambitions now span factories, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and nearly any domain that can be trained, tested, or perfected in simulation before ever touching the real world. If something can be modeled, Nvidia wants to power it.

Nvidia’s real obsession is physical AI

The biggest buzzword of the night was “physical AI,” Nvidia’s term for AI systems that don’t just generate content but actually act. These models are trained in virtual environments using synthetic data, then deployed into physical machines once they’ve learned how the world works.

Huang showcased Cosmos, a world foundation model capable of simulating environments and predicting movement, alongside Alpamayo, a reasoning model specifically designed for autonomous driving. This is the tech Nvidia says will power robots, industrial automation, and self-driving vehicles, as demonstrated by the Mercedes-Benz CLA, which was shown running AI-defined driving on stage. The company also revealed plans to test its own robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027, using Level 4 autonomous vehicles capable of driving without human intervention in limited regions.

Nvidia hasn’t announced where the service will launch or with whom it’s partnering, but the move signals a shift from being a behind-the-scenes supplier to actively participating in the self-driving race. Huang has already described robotics — including autonomous vehicles — as Nvidia’s second-most important growth category after AI itself.

No New GPUs

If you were waiting for new consumer GPUs, you probably noticed very quickly that there weren’t any. Nvidia didn’t announce a single new GeForce card, and that felt entirely intentional. Instead, Huang spent most of the keynote talking about Rubin, Nvidia’s next-generation AI platform that’s already in full production.

Rubin is described as more than just a chip, but an entire system. GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale. Nvidia framed this as essential to keeping up with skyrocketing AI demand, where training costs, energy use, and bottlenecks are becoming existential problems.

The absence of gaming hardware shouldn't be considered a snub, but it is clear that Nvidia is no longer driven by gamers. It's kind of been clear that's been the case for a while, but today's conference really drove the nail in the coffin. Instead, the company's ambitions are driven by hyperscalers, governments, and anyone trying to automate everything that moves.

'Open' AI, powered by Nvidia hardware

The third major takeaway was Nvidia’s ongoing push to make itself unavoidable through openness — or at least Nvidia’s version of it. Huang repeatedly emphasized that the company isn’t just selling hardware, but open AI models that developers can actually use, fine-tune, and deploy (not to be confused with ChatGPT developer OpenAI). Nvidia now has open models spanning healthcare, climate science, robotics, embodied intelligence, reasoning AI, and autonomous driving, all trained on Nvidia supercomputers and released as foundational building blocks. They've practically become the corn of tech.

Even personal AI agents got some stage time, with demos of local agents running on Nvidia’s DGX Spark hardware. Nvidia aims to be the platform beneath every AI system, from massive data centers to individual desktops. It’s an elegant strategy — sell openness, but still own the pipes.

Taken together, the keynote felt like a declaration. Nvidia isn’t chasing CES hype cycles any more. It’s positioning itself as the backbone of an AI-powered world, where the most important announcements don’t happen on stage, and the most impactful products aren’t meant to fit under your desk.",https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06Xo82tWDIYCfuZRGSYuhmu/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1767660808.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:01:04.830607

HP updates its commercial laptop lineup with EliteBook X G2 Those looking for a more traditional portable computer will find options in HP's new lineup of EliteBook X G2 laptops.
The EliteBook X G2i features Intel's upcoming ""Panther Lake,"" Core Ultra 5, and Ultra 7 series processors, while the EliteBook X G2q (Q for Qualcomm) is powered by Snapdragon X2 Elite or X Plus processors, and the EliteBook X G2a (A for AMD) runs AMD Ryzen AI 5, 7, or 9 chips.
You can power the EliteBook X G2 with an included 65 W or 100 W power adapter (your choice).
In the case of the EliteBook X G2q, the modem comes from Qualcomm, while the AMD and Intel versions have HP R15 or R18 5G connectivity.","At most businesses today, the IT department gives laptops out to employees so they can easily take their work with them. But HP has a different idea: build a Windows computer into a full-size keyboard and let you carry that around, plugging into monitors and mice along the way.

Announced on Monday at CES 2026, the HP EliteBoard G1a looks like a standard desktop keyboard, complete with 93 keys, including a number pad. Its keys have a solid 2 mm of travel, more than most laptops, and felt OK to type on during our brief hands-on, but it's not mechanical so isn't the best keyboard money can buy. However, look at the back surface and you'll notice a small vent where air comes out and either two USB-C ports, or, on some SKus, a single port with a built-in USB-C cable that hangs off it like a tail.

The idea is that you plug the EliteBoard G1a into a monitor that has USB-C video input and allow it to send data and get power over a single wire. Connect a wireless mouse and you've got your workstation covered. Maintain a similar monitor and mouse setup at home and you can carry just the keyboard back and forth.

If your monitor, like the majority on the market, doesn't have a USB-C input, you can use an included USB-to-HDMI adapter to connect. You can use a 65 W USB-C power adapter to juice the G1a if it's not getting electricity directly from the monitor.

The G1a weighs between 1.49 and 1.69 pounds, depending on config, and measures 14.1 in x 4.7 in x 0.7 inches, so it is more portable than most laptops, though it is longer and thicker than some. At its CES preview, HP showed off a long, thin envelope you can use to carry it and said it would also fit into any laptop bag that holds a 16-inch or larger laptop.

The G1a comes powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 or 7 (330, 340, or 350 Pro) with integrated AMD Radeon 800 graphics and an NPU that runs at up to 50 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second). Those specs make it a Copilot+ PC by Microsoft's standards, which means you get certain offline AI features like Microsoft Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Studio Effects. You can get it with up to 64 GB of DDR5 5600 MT/s RAM and up to 2 TB of SSD storage, along with Wi-Fi 6E or 7 connectivity.

When it comes out in March, the G1a will be available either with or without an embedded cable. It's unclear what the price difference will be, but having an embedded cable is a disadvantage because it makes the keyboard harder to carry safely and easier to break.

You'll also be able to configure the G1a with or without a 32 Wh battery that HP claims can offer up to 3.5 hours of unplugged use or two days in sleep. It's difficult to imagine a scenario where you'd need to use the keyboard without a power source, but having it be asleep while you carry it from one destination to another would be a huge plus.

HP is marketing the EliteBoard G1a as an enterprise device, which means enterprise-grade security. The keyboard PC will have HP Wolf Security for Business, which protects the BIOS from firmware attacks.

By building the PC into a keyboard and selling the G1a based on portability, HP hopes to change business behavior from laptop culture to keyboard culture. This could theoretically work in businesses that practice hoteling and expect employees to carry their keyboard to whatever hot desk they are using today.

However, asking employees to have a similar monitor and mouse setup at home seems like an additional hassle that IT departments won't want and, if the business has to pay for this home monitor, the cost of this solution and the support needed become more of a hassle. We don't know how much the G1a will cost either. To justify itself, it would have to cost significantly less than a business laptop.

Where we could see the G1a taking off is in call centers or other environments where desk space is tight. In lieu of buying an all-in-one PC, companies could buy HP's keyboard computer and stick it on the desk for various employees to use as they come on and off shift. But taking it back and forth between locations seems like a rare use case.

HP updates its commercial laptop lineup with EliteBook X G2

Those looking for a more traditional portable computer will find options in HP's new lineup of EliteBook X G2 laptops. These 14-inch laptops are available with a choice of three different processor platforms from each of the three PC CPU manufacturers. The EliteBook X G2i features Intel's upcoming ""Panther Lake,"" Core Ultra 5, and Ultra 7 series processors, while the EliteBook X G2q (Q for Qualcomm) is powered by Snapdragon X2 Elite or X Plus processors, and the EliteBook X G2a (A for AMD) runs AMD Ryzen AI 5, 7, or 9 chips.

The 14-inch laptop weighs around 2.4 pounds (1.09 kg) in most configurations, but there's also an Intel-powered G2i lightweight config that starts at 2.2 pounds (998 g) and a bend-back 2-in-1 called the EliteBook X Flip G2i that tips the scales at 2.86 pounds (1.29 kg). Depending on config, you can get it with a variety of screen panel options, ranging from a 1920 x 1200, 300-nit panel on the low end to a 2880 x 1800 OLED touch screen that goes up to 700 nits and 120 Hz.

The EliteBook X G2 series laptops are available with up to a 2 TB PCIe SSD and as much as 64 GB of LPDDR5x RAM. They sport a 5 MP webcam that has an IR sensor for facial recognition and can do human presence detection to tell if you're at your seat.

You can power the EliteBook X G2 with an included 65 W or 100 W power adapter (your choice). There's a built-in three-cell, 56 Wh or six-cell, 68 Wh battery.

All versions of the laptop come with Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, Bluetooth 6, and the option of adding a 5G modem. In the case of the EliteBook X G2q, the modem comes from Qualcomm, while the AMD and Intel versions have HP R15 or R18 5G connectivity. The lightweight G2i model is Wi-Fi only.

HP brings Copilot to enterprise printers

If your company has a Microsoft 365 Copilot account and you own or plan to buy an HP Enterprise printer that works with its ecosystem of Workpath apps, you'll soon be able to get that AI directly in your print/scan solution.

Dubbed HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot and due out this spring, the new on-printer software lets you do new AI-related kinds of things directly from the printer/scanner's touch screen. First, you'll be able to redact personally identifiable information from documents before you print them. Imagine scanning in a resume or opening it up from OneDrive and having the name and other information blacked out so that hiring managers can only look at the qualifications.

You'll also be able to have Copilot suggest file names for documents you scan so that you can easily identify them when looking through your folders. As you might expect, Copilot will also print AI-generated summaries of documents in lieu of the documents themselves and will do translation on-device. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2026/01/02/hp0.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 23:00:33.675139

“Full ownership of PA Consulting will further strengthen Jacobs’ capabilities in advisory, digital and transformation services,” the company said, describing the deal as aligned with its long-term strategy to support clients across the full lifecycle of major programs.

Additional details disclosed in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show the acquisition is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings within the first 12 months following closing. Jacobs said it plans to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. Upon closing, PA Consulting will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Jacobs.

According to the filing, the transaction implies an enterprise value of approximately $4.0 billion (£3.05 billion) for PA Consulting, based on closing assumptions and expected adjustments. The filing also discloses about $99 million (£75 million) in deferred consideration, payable two years after closing and tied to Jacobs’ share performance, a structure that keeps PA Consulting’s stakeholders economically aligned with Jacobs’ long-term operating results.

Jacobs said the transaction will require national security approvals in the United Kingdom and Denmark, reflecting PA Consulting’s involvement in government, defense and other sensitive infrastructure-related advisory work.

In a Jan. 5 research note, Baird Equity Research said the transaction values PA Consulting at roughly 13 times adjusted EBITDA, declining to about 12.3 times when anticipated cost synergies are included. The analyst said the deal’s incremental earnings impact will appear modest due to accounting treatment, noting that Jacobs had already been consolidating most of PA Consulting’s results prior to full ownership.

Full ownership would have modestly lifted Jacobs’ adjusted margin—by about 60 basis points—based on fiscal 2025 results, reflecting the higher-margin profile of advisory work, the note said.

Now, it's just another opportunity for Nvidia to peddle its AI hardware and software — in particular its next-gen Vera Rubin architecture.

The AI arms dealer boasts that, compared to Blackwell, the chips will deliver up to 5x higher floating point performance for inference, 3.5x for training, along with 2.8x more memory bandwidth and an NvLink interconnect that's now twice as fast.

But don't get too excited just yet. It's not like the chips are launching earlier than previously expected. They're still expected to arrive in the second half of the year, just like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra did.

Nvidia normally holds off until GTC in March to reveal its next-gen chips. Perhaps AMD's aggressive rack scale roadmap has Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang nervous. Announced at Advancing AI late last spring and expected later this year, AMD's double-wide Helios racks promise to deliver performance on par with Vera Rubin NVL72 while offering customers 50 percent more HBM4.

Nvidia has also been teasing the Vera Rubin platform for nearly a year now, to the point where there's not much we didn't already know about the platform.

But even though you won't be able to get your hands on Rubin for a few more months, it's never too early for a closer look at what the multi-million dollar machines will buy you.

NVL72 refined

The flagship system for Nvidia's Vera Rubin CPU and GPU architectures is once again its NVL72 rack systems. At first blush, the machine doesn't look all that different from its Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra-based siblings. But under the hood, Nvidia has been hard at work refining the architecture for better serviceability and telemetry.

Switch trays can now be serviced without taking down the machine first. Nvidia also has new reliability, availability, and serviceability features which enable customers to check in on the health of the GPUs without dropping them from the cluster first. These health checks can now run between training checkpoints or jobs, Ian Buck, Nvidia's VP and General Manager of Hyperscale and HPC, tells El Reg.

At the heart of the rack is the Vera Rubin superchip, which, if history tells us anything, should bear the VR200 code name.

Much like Blackwell, the Vera Rubin superchip features two dual-die Rubin GPUs, each capable of churning out 50 petaFLOPS of inference performance or 35 petaFLOPS for training. Both of those numbers refer to peak performance achievable when using NVLFP4 data type.

According to Buck, for this generation, Nvidia is using a new adaptive compression technique that's better suited to generative AI and mixture of experts (MoE) model inference to achieve the 50 petaFLOP claim rather than structured sparsity. As you may recall, while structured sparsity did have benefits for certain workloads, it didn't offer many if any advantages for LLM inference.

Of course, higher-precision data types remain relevant for many workloads, whether for vision-language model inference, image generation, fine-tuning, training, or high-performance computing (HPC). In this respect Nvidia hasn't deprecated support for any data types, but its approach to some like FP64 has changed a little.

FP64 is essential for HPC and scientific computing workloads, such as physics simulations and material analysis, and compared to Blackwell, performance regressed from 45 teraFLOPS to 33 TFLOPS of double-precision vector performance on Rubin. For FP64 matrix applications, which are what the Top500 ranking of the most powerful publicly known supercomputers is heavily weighted toward, performance is achieved using emulation, an approach that was pioneered on Blackwell accelerators.

The GPUs are fed by 288 GB of HBM4 memory — 576 GB per superchip — which, despite delivering the same capacity as the Blackwell Ultra-based GB300, is now 2.8x faster at 22 TB/s per socket (44 TB/s per superchip). If that number seems a little high, that's because Nvidia initially targeted 13 TB/s of HBM4 bandwidth when it first teased Rubin last year. Buck tells us that the jump to 22 TB/s was attained entirely through silicon and doesn't rely on techniques like memory compression.

The two Rubin GPUs are paired to Nvidia's new Vera CPU via a 1.8 TB/s NvLink-C2C interconnect. The CPU contains 88 of Nvidia's custom Arm-based Olympus cores and is paired with 1.5 TB of LPDDR5x memory — 3x that of the GB200. We guess we know why memory is in such short supply these days. Actually it's more complicated than that, but this certainly isn't helping the situation.

However, one of the most important features Vera brings to the table is support for confidential computing across the system's NvLink domain, something that previously was only available on x86-based HGX systems.

Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL72 racks feature 72 Rubin GPUs, 20.7 TB of HBM4, 36 Vera CPUs, 54 TB of LPDDR5x which are spread across 18 compute blades interconnected by nine NvSwitch 6 blades which deliver 3.6 TB/s of bandwidth to each GPU — twice that of last gen.

Nvidia isn't ready to say how much power that additional compute and bandwidth will require. However, Buck tells us that while it will be higher, we shouldn't expect power to double.

Wasn't it supposed to be 144?

If you're scratching your head wondering ""didn't Nvidia say this thing was supposed to have 144 GPUs?"" you wouldn't be the only one. At GTC 2025, Huang announced that they were changing the way they counted GPUs from the package to the dies on board. In that sense, the Blackwell-based NVL72s also had 144 GPUs, but Nvidia was going to wait for Vera Rubin to make the switch to the new convention.

It seems Nvidia has since changed its mind and is sticking with the established naming convention. Having said that, we may yet see Nvidia racks with at least 144 GPUs on board before long.

Then there's CPX

The Rubin CPUs we've talked about up to this point actually are one of two accelerators announced so far. Rubin CPX is the other.

Unveiled in September, the chip is a more niche product, designed specifically to accelerate the compute-intense prefill phase of LLM inference. Since prefill isn't bandwidth-bound, CPX doesn't need HBM and can instead make do with slower DRAM.

Each CPX accelerator will be capable of churning out 30 petaFLOPS of NVFP4 compute and will sport 128 GB of GDDR7 memory.

In a graphic shared this summer, Nvidia showed an NVL144 CPX blade with four 288 GB Rubin SXM modules and eight Rubin CPX prefill accelerators for a total of 12 GPUs per node.

The complete rack system would only need 12 compute blades for the thing to have 144 GPUs, though only 48 of them would be connected via NVLink.

Stitching together a SuperPOD

As with past Nvidia rack systems, eight NVL72 racks form a SuperPOD with the GPU slinger's Spectrum-X Ethernet and/or Quantum-X InfiniBand the glue used to stitch them together. Multiple SuperPODS can then be combined to form larger compute environments for training or distributed inference.

If you aren't ready to make the switch to Nvidia's rack-scale kit, don't worry. Eight-way (NVL8) HGX systems based around the Rubin platform are still available, but we're told liquid cooling is no longer a suggestion, but a requirement. These smaller systems, 64 to be exact, can also be combined to form a SuperPOD with 512 GPUs — just shy of the of the more powerful NVL72 SuperPOD at 576.

For this generation, Nvidia also has two new NICs, which it teased on a few occasions over the last year. At GTC DC, Nvidia showed off the ConnectX-9, a 1.6 Tbps ""superNIC"" designed for high-speed distributed computing, which we sometimes call the backend network.

For storage, management, and security, Nvidia is pushing its BlueField-4 data processing units (DPUs), which feature an integrated 800 Gbps ConnectX-9 NIC and a 64-core Grace CPU on board. This, we should note, isn't the same Grace CPU found in the GB200, but a newer version based on Arm's Neoverse V3 core architecture.

The beefier CPU is designed to offload software defined networking, storage, security, and can also run hypervisors for virtualized environments.

Playing Whac-A-Mole with inference bottlenecks

Cramming 64 Grace cores onto a NIC might seem like overkill, but Nvidia has a specific reason for wanting that much compute hanging off the machine like a computer in front of a computer.

Alongside all its shiny new hardware, Nvidia showed off what it's describing as a ""new class of memory between the GPU and storage,"" designed to offload key value (KV) caches.

The basic idea isn't new. KV caches store the model's state. You can think of this like its short-term memory. Calculating the key value vectors is one of the more compute-intensive aspects of the inference.

Because inference workloads often involve passing over the same info multiple times, it makes sense to cache the computed vectors in memory. By doing this, only changes need to be computed and data in the cache can be reused. This sounds simple, but, in practice, KV caches can be quite large, easily consuming tens of gigabytes in order to keep track of 100,000 or so tokens. That might sound like a lot, but a single user running a code assistant or agent can blow through that rather quickly.

As we understand it, Nvidia's Inference Context Storage platform will work with storage platforms from multiple partner vendors, and will take advantage of the BlueField-4 DPU, NIXL GPU direct storage libraries, and optimize KV cache offloading for maximum performance and efficiency.

Combined with technologies like Rubin CPX, this kind of high-performance KV offloading should allow the GPUs to spend more time generating tokens and less time waiting on data to be shuffled about and recomputed.

The AI infrastructure arena heats up

Nvidia's decision to ""launch"" Rubin — again it isn't actually shipping in volume yet — betrays an increasingly competitive compute landscape.

As we mentioned earlier, AMD's Helios rack systems promise to deliver floating point performance roughly equivalent to Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL72 at 2.9 exaFLOPS versus 2.5-3.6 exaFLOPS of FP4, respectively. For applications that can't take advantage of Nvidia's adaptive compression tech, Helios is, at least on paper, faster.

However, with Nvidia planning to ship faster memory on Rubin than initially planned, AMD no longer has a bandwidth advantage. It does still have a capacity lead with 432 GB of HBM4 per GPU socket compared to 288 GB on Rubin. In theory, this should allow the AMD-based system to serve 50 percent larger MoE models on a single double-wide rack.

In practice, the real-world performance is going to depend heavily on how well tunneling Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) over Broadcom's Tomahawk 6 Ethernet switches actually works.

AMD's MI450-series GPUs appear very well positioned to compete against Rubin, but as we've seen repeated with Amazon and Google, the ability to scale that compute often makes a bigger difference than the chip's individual performance.

AMD is also having to play catch up on the software ecosystem front. The company's HIP and ROCm libraries have certainly come a long way since the MI300X made its debut at the end of 2023, but the company still has a ways to go.

LLMs, robots, and autonomous cars

Nvidia certainly isn't making the situation any easier for AMD. At CES, the GPU giant unveiled a slew of new software frameworks aimed at enterprises, robotics devs, and the automotive industry.

This includes the development of new foundation models for domain specific applications like retrieval augmented generation, safety, speech, and autonomous driving.

The latter, called Alpamayo, is a relatively small ""reasoning vision language action"" model designed to help level-4 autonomous vehicles better handle unique and fast evolving road conditions. Level-4 capable vehicles are capable of driving fully autonomously, unsupervised driving in specific environments, like high-ways or urban environments.

Nvidia's autonomous driving stack is due to hit US roads late this year with the level-2++ capable Mercedes Benz CLA. This class of autonomous vehicle is capable of driving itself in similar conditions as level-4, but requires the supervision of a human operator.

Everybody has a theory about why Nvidia dropped $20B on Groq - they're mostly wrong

What about GTC?

With Nvidia kicking off the New Year with Rubin — a chip we hadn't expected to get a good look at for another three months — we're left to wonder what we'll see at GTC, which is slated to run from March 16-19 in San Jose, California.

In addition to the regular mix of software libraries and foundation models, we expect to get a lot more details on the Kyber racks that'll underpin the company's Vera Rubin Ultra platform starting in 2027.

As you might have noticed, Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and others have gotten in the habit of pre-announcing products well in advance of them shipping or becoming generally available. As the saying goes: enterprises don't buy products, they buy roadmaps. In this case, however, it's really about ensuring they have somewhere to put them.

Nvidia's Kyber racks are expected to pull 600 kilowatts of power which means datacenter operators need to start preparing now, if they want to deploy them on day one.

We don't yet have a full picture of what Vera Rubin Ultra will offer, but we know it'll feature four reticle-sized Rubin Ultra GPUs, 1TB of HBM4e, and will deliver 100 petaFLOPS of FP4 performance.

As things currently stand, Nvidia plans to cram 144 of these GPU packages (576 GPU dies) into a single NvLink domain which is expected to deliver 15 exaFLOPS of FP4 inference performance or 10 exaFLOPS for training. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/03/18/nvidia_blackwell_ultra_cover.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 23:01:05.425070

""The role of the head coach is not to be a cheerleader,"" Johnson said Monday. ""It's to say it like it is. If something pops up and I feel like it needs to be said, then I say it. If I don't, then we keep it moving.

""We've got a great group of guys. We've got a prideful group. We've earned a division title. We've earned the No. 2 seed in the NFC. Those are things that we're certainly proud about, and at the same time, the season's not over. It's just starting for us, and our guys understand that. We can play better than what we played at the end of the season and that's really our expectation going forward.""

Johnson believes that the offense is close to reverting to the unit that helped the Bears average 27.8 points in the six games that preceded their loss to the Lions.

""We're not far away; you never are in this league,"" Johnson said. ""You're really close and so we've just got to clean up some of the mental errors we had. I think in the first 11 plays we counted six mentals as an offense. When you're facing a good team, you can't do that. And so we'll clean that up. We'll be a lot sharper here going forward, and so we're going to be OK. But when you have eight possessions and three of them are three-and-outs, it's just not a recipe for good football.""

The Bears defense also is focused on improving. On Sunday, the Lions scored on their first three possessions and compiled 237 yards and 15 first downs in the first half in taking a 13-0 halftime lead.

""We have a number of areas where we can play better,"" Johnson said. ""But at the same time, I mean the No. 1 thing is we're looking to limit the opponent with their points.

See our latest analysis for International Business Machines.

Over the past year, International Business Machines has seen short term share price pressure, with a 7 day share price return of 4.66% and 30 day share price return of 5.34%, alongside a much stronger 1 year total shareholder return of 34.29%. This suggests earlier momentum has cooled recently, even as long term holders have still done well.

If IBM’s recent moves have you thinking about where else capital could work hard in tech and AI, it may be worth scanning high growth tech and AI stocks as a next step.

So with IBM’s recent short term pullback sitting against strong multi year total returns and annual revenue and net income growth, is the stock quietly offering value today, or is the market already pricing in its future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 1% Undervalued

With International Business Machines last closing at US$291.50 and the most followed narrative pointing to fair value around US$293.89, the gap is small but meaningful for investors weighing upside against execution risk.

The analysts are assuming International Business Machines's revenue will grow by 5.1% annually over the next 3 years. The launch of the z17 mainframe with enhanced AI acceleration and energy efficiency is anticipated to drive significant customer adoption, positively impacting infrastructure revenue and possibly net margins due to differentiation and pricing power.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what kind of earnings profile and margin mix sits behind that near inline fair value? The narrative leans heavily on steady top line gains, thicker profitability and a future earnings multiple more commonly associated with higher growth IT names. Are you interested in how those moving parts connect across revenue, margins and valuation assumptions?

Result: Fair Value of $293.89 (ABOUT RIGHT)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, there are still pressure points to watch, especially any slowdown in IBM’s consumption-based software services or weaker consulting demand if clients delay discretionary projects.

Most Popular Narrative: 6.3% Undervalued

Compared with the last close at €363.30, the most followed narrative points to a higher fair value based on future earnings power and cash flows.

Major capital allocation to acquisitions and digital or AI-driven innovation is expected to increase category leadership, fuel product differentiation, and raise future revenue and net margins.

The company that runs the once-vibrant Westfield mall filed unlawful detainer complaints Friday in San Francisco Superior Court to kick out a restaurant, an eyebrow salon, and a shoe repair shop.

On Monday, a sign just inside the mall’s Fifth Street entrance still listed dozens of shuttered businesses as if they were still open for business. There was barely anyone shopping at the dwindling shops, such as H&M and shoe store Ecco, which offered steep markdowns for pre-closure sales.

The court filings, in three cases, target the owners and operators of Shoe Wiz, on the mall’s concourse, the Executive Order Bar & Lounge, and Eyebrow Plus beauty chain. None responded to requests for comment Monday.

Since it was foreclosed on in November, the mall has been controlled by a Delaware-based entity that represents the lender. An attorney for the mall, Gregory P. Barbee, did not respond to requests for comment.

The San Francisco Centre, which once housed Nordstrom and a flagship Bloomingdale’s, has struggled since the pandemic. The lender-controlled entity has been working to either restructure the asset or prepare it for sale or redevelopment.

According to a complaint filed against the CEO of beauty chain Eyebrow Plus, the store was given a three-day notice to leave on Dec. 13. The filing, which notes that the store remained open Dec. 18, seeks damages of $201.37 “for each day Defendant continues in possession of the Premises and through the time of judgment,” plus a declaration of forfeiture and recovery of suit costs. Shoe Wiz, steps away from the mall’s still busy Panda Express restaurant, was locked; boxes and shelves of merchandise could be seen.

At Eyebrow Plus, a lone employee who declined to share her name stood ready to handle any walk-in customers. She said the business was set to close by Jan. 31.",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_tihmcnrmm975t61t39rqr3k208/-FWEBP,N,,2026-01-05 21:01:19.079677

Alpha Mayo is trained end-to-end, literally from camera in to actuation out.

The camera in, lots and lots of miles that are driven by itself, where we human drive it, driven using human demonstration.

And we have lots and lots of miles that are generated by cosmos.

In addition to that, hundreds of thousands of examples are labeled very, very carefully so that we could teach the car how to drive.

Alpha Mayo does something that's really special.

Not only does it take sensor input and activates steering wheel, brakes and and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it is about to take.

It tells you what action it's going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action, and then of course, the trajectory.

All of these are coupled directly and trained very specifically by a large combination of human trained and as well as cosmos generated data.

The result of it is just really incredible. Not only does your car drive as you would expect it to drive, and it drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators.

But in every single scenario, when it comes up to the scenario, it reasons about, it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what you what's about to do.

Now, the reason why this is so important is because of the long tail of driving.

There it's impossible for us to simply collect every single possible scenario for everything that could ever happen in every single country, in every single circumstance that's possibly ever going to happen for all of population.

However, it is very unlikely, it's very likely that every scenario, if decomposed into a whole bunch of other smaller scenarios are quite normal for you to understand.

And so these long tails will be decomposed into quite normal circumstances that the car knows how to deal with.

Sydney, Jan 6, 2026 AEST (ABN Newswire) - Locksley Resources Limited (ASX:LKY) (X5L:FRA) (LKYRF:OTCMKTS) advised that recent reconnaissance and surface sampling programs have successfully identified a consistent northwest to southeast oriented mineralised corridor at the Mojave Project.

HIGHLIGHTS

- Results from rock chip sampling returns 409g/t Ag confirming high-grade silver mineralisation ~3km from the initial high-grade silver discovery (Sample 258140), 320m southwest of the Desert Antimony Mine (DAM)

- Significant base metal mineralisation confirmed in addition to silver, with samples returning grades up to 4.2% Copper (Cu), 1.5% Lead (Pb), and 1.5% Zinc (Zn), highlighting the polymetallic nature of the system

- Twelve (12) rock chip samples exceeded 30g/t Ag, reinforcing additional precious and base metal potential within the Mojave Project's North Block

- This discovery represents an important advancement in the Company's exploration strategy and identifies a new, potentially high-value component of the Mojave Project

This discovery represents an important advancement in the Company's exploration strategy and identifies a new, potentially high-value component of the Mojave Project. The delineation of a mineralised corridor suggests a strike extent approximately 2.4km westnorthwest of the Hendricks Shaft, and approximately 600m to the east-southeast, extending the mineralised corridor almost 3km from the Silver Prospect. This confirms the presence of a polymetallic quartz vein system, which includes the high-grade sample 258140 collected from a 3cm to 10cm wide vein (Figure 1*). These early results possibly suggest that the Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu mineralisation may reflect the presence of a large-scale hydrothermal system, which could potentially contain valuable concentrations of precious and base metals. Further exploration is required to test this concept.

Rock chip sampling within the Mojave Project's North Block has returned results of up to 409g/t Ag, with associated base metal values of up to 1.5% Zn and 0.88% Pb, supporting the interpretation of a polymetallic mineralised system and enhancing the prospectivity of the corridor. Additional rock chip sample 258420 returned values up to 117g/t Ag, & 3.1% Cu, also located within the interpreted mineralised corridor located close to a historic adit and workings.

The interpreted mineralised corridor includes the historic Hendricks Shaft, located approximately 2.4km from the initial high-grade silver discovery. A total of 398 rock chip samples have been collected across the North Block with ~260 of these being collected along the mineralised corridor between DAM and up to 5.6km to the southeast.

Rock Chip Sampling Program Details

The recent sampling campaign was designed to test the strike extent of the high-grade silver mineralisation first identified in late 2024. The results (see Table 1) have exceededexpectations, confirming that the mineralised system extends significantly beyond the initial discovery zone (Sample 258140 - Figure 1*).

Key observations from the program include:

- Strike Extension: The mineralised corridor is now interpreted to extend from the Silver Prospect (Sample 258140) to historical trenches and stockpiles (Samples 258184 & 258185) located ~3km to the south-east significantly increasing the strike extent of the exploration target.

- Mineralisation Style: High-grade samples 258184 and 258185, collected from outcropping veins and historic stockpiles, exhibit quartz with gossanous selvages with boxwork textures. These are potential indicators of weathered sulphide-rich polymetallic veins, suggesting fresh sulphides may exist at depth.

- Visual Copper: Sample 258420 (which returned 117g/t Ag & 3.1% Cu) was collected from outcropping mineralisation at historic workings where copper carbonate (i.e. malachite) is visually prevalent (see Figure 3*). This confirms a copper component to the mineralised system.

Next Steps

Locksley will advance this exciting silver and base metal opportunity through a systematic exploration program run in parallel with ongoing activities at DAM and El Campo, comprising:

- Systematic Mapping: Detailed geological mapping between the Silver Prospect and the new south-eastern extension to define the structural geometry and continuity of the trend.

- Petrology and Geochemistry: Submission of samples for petrological interpretation to assist with determining relative timing of mineralisation and geochemical associations across the system.

- Geophysics: Assessment of geophysical survey options, such as Very Low Frequency electromagnetics (VLF-EM), Induced Polarisation (IP), or Electromagnetic (e.g. VTEM) to potentially identify mineralised zones and structures at depth that are not visible at surface.

- Drill Targeting: The goal of this work is to delineate high-priority drill-ready targets along the NW-SE corridor for future testing.

Additional work is planned to improve understanding of the corridor's structural geometry, enabling more effective drill targeting and delineation of the extent and grade of mineralisation within the North Block.

Kerrie Matthews, Managing Director & CEO, commented:

""Defining a 3km mineralised trend with surface results of up to 409 g/t silver and 1.5% copper is a highly encouraging outcome. Importantly, this discovery complements our core antimony development strategy and gives exposure as a diversified U.S. critical minerals company, providing shareholders with upside to precious metals, base metals, and strategic minerals within a single, high-quality project area.""

About Locksley Resources Limited

Locksley Resources Limited (ASX:LKY) (FRA:X5L) (OTCMKTS:LKYRF) is an ASX listed explorer focused on critical minerals in the United States of America. The Company is actively advancing exploration across two key assets: the Mojave Project in California, targeting rare earth elements (REEs) and antimony. Locksley Resources aims to generate shareholder value through strategic exploration, discovery and development in this highly prospective mineral region.

Mojave Project

Located in the Mojave Desert, California, the Mojave Project comprises over 250 claims across two contiguous prospect areas, namely, the North Block/Northeast Block and the El Campo Prospect. The North Block directly abuts claims held by MP Materials, while El Campo lies along strike of the Mountain Pass Mine and is enveloped by MP Materials' claims, highlighting the strong geological continuity and exploration potential of the project area.

In addition to rare earths, the Mojave Project hosts the historic ""Desert Antimony Mine"", which last operated in 1937. Despite the United States currently having no domestic antimony production, demand for the metal remains high due to its essential role in defense systems, semiconductors, and metal alloys. With significant surface sample results, the Desert Mine prospect represents one of the highest-grade known antimony occurrences in the U.S.

Locksley's North American position is further strengthened by rising geopolitical urgency to diversify supply chains away from China, the global leader in both REE & antimony production. With its maiden drilling program planned, the Mojave Project is uniquely positioned to align with U.S. strategic objectives around critical mineral independence and economic security.

Tottenham Project

Locksley's Australian portfolio comprises the advanced Tottenham Copper-Gold Project in New South Wales, focused on VMS-style mineralisation in a well established mining region.

Locksley is committed to delivering value through discovery, development, and strategic partnerships, with a focus on securing access to U.S. aligned funding and downstream collaborations.

Demand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat.
It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.","Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.

On Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.

Mr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.

Nvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.

Companies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.

If the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.

“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.

The Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.

The rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.

Because more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.

The competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.

In December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.

Demand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.

Nvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.

Still, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.

On Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.

Since 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/05/multimedia/NVIDIA-Vera-rubin-qjcl/NVIDIA-Vera-rubin-qjcl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 19:01:54.785243

Novo Nordisk on Monday officially launched in the U.S. the pill version of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Negotiations with the Trump administration led Novo to price a starter dose at $149 per month for some Medicare beneficiaries and those willing to pay cash. The drug’s website shows that the $149 price will apply to the 1.5 milligram and 4 milligram doses until April 15, after which the higher of the two doses will cost $199. Monthly supplies of a 9 milligram and 25 milligram dose, meanwhile, are priced at $299. People with commercial insurance could pay as little as $25 per month out of pocket, Novo said.

Dutch biotech Argenx will swap CEOs, announcing Monday that leader Tim Van Hauwermeiren will become board chair in May 2026 as part of a planned leadership transition. Once the change is effective, current COO Karen Massey will succeed Van Hauwermeiren and take over what’s in recent years become one of the industry’s most valuable companies thanks to the fast-selling autoimmune drug Vyvgart. Despite the pending CEO switch, Argenx “is in a position of strength” with that drug on track for more than $4 billion in 2025 revenue, “sustainable profitability and a strong balance sheet,” wrote Stifel analyst Alex Thompson.

Sanofi on Dec. 24 agreed to pay $15.50 per share, or about $2.2 billion, to acquire vaccine developer Dynavax Technologies. The deal hands Sanofi a marketed hepatitis B vaccine for adults and a shingles shot that’s currently in early-stage testing. Dynavax’s hepatitis B shot, Hepsilav-B, is administered in two doses over the course of a month, which is supposed to provide higher levels of protection more quickly than other available vaccines. The deal is a “smart strategic move” for Sanofi, giving the company one vaccine with a 46% share of its addressable market and another candidate in the “large and durable” business for shingles shots, wrote Leerink Partners’ David Risinger.

That same day, however, the FDA also rejected Sanofi’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug tolebrutinib. The agency had previously delayed a decision on tolebrutinib, which was being evaluated for non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. And Sanofi had said in mid-December that more guidance would come from the agency sometime in the first quarter of 2026. However, the FDA instead turned back tolebrutinib, which Sanofi research chief Houman Ashrafian referred to in a statement as a “significant and meaningful change in direction” from previous feedback. The rejection represents the latest setback for tolebrutinib, which has failed studies in two other kinds of multiple sclerosis. Jefferies analyst Michael Leuchten also wrote that he expects a “hit to sentiment and questions on management credibility,” given Sanofi’s previous statements about the drug.

An intuitive in-ride experience that builds on the unprecedented comfort of the all-electric Lucid Gravity, with interactive screens that let riders personalize their autonomous journey — from heated-seat and climate controls to music, as well as options to contact support, or request the vehicle to pull-over.

In-vehicle visualization that shows what the robotaxi sees and its planned path in real-time, including maneuvers such as yielding to pedestrians, slowing at traffic lights, changing lanes, and dropping off a passenger.

A versatile, spacious layout with configurations that comfortably fit up to six passengers and offer generous luggage space, creating a premium solution for group travel.

High-performance compute based on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, part of the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform, supporting the real-time AI processing and system integration required for advanced autonomous driving.

""The debut of our production intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale,"" said Dave Ferguson, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Nuro. ""By bringing together Nuro's proven level 4 autonomy, Lucid's advanced vehicle architecture, and Uber's global reach, we're building a robotaxi service designed for real-world operations and long-term growth.""

""Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year,"" said Sarfraz Maredia, Global Head of Autonomous Mobility & Delivery at Uber. ""By combining leading expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we're building a unique new option for affordable and scalable autonomous rides in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.""

""Our robotaxi program with Uber and Nuro is a key part of how Lucid is leveraging its technology to create a more sustainable future of mobility that is widely accessible,"" said Kay Stepper, Vice President of ADAS and Autonomous at Lucid. ""Our engineering, range and interior comfort offers a unique platform, and when combined with Nuro's technology and Uber's scale, we are collectively building an experience like no other.""

Autonomous on-road testing is part of Nuro's safety and validation framework, honed over years of commercial autonomous deployments. The program evaluates dozens of critical capabilities across the full autonomy stack including Nuro's end-to-end AI foundation model, which blends state-of-the-art AI with clear, verifiable safety logic for comfortable, reliable performance. In addition to on-road testing, the program includes closed-course testing and simulation to validate performance across a wide range of scenarios.

Pending final validation, the production intent robotaxi is expected to start production at Lucid's Arizona factory later this year.

The robotaxi will be on public display for CES attendees at NVIDIA's showcase at the Fontainebleau Hotel starting Monday, January 5 at 3:00 PM PT through Thursday, January 8th, 2026.

Last week, I sent out some predictions for 2026, and a few days before that, looked back on the 2025 predictions. Below, some other things I wrote over the break.

I Wrote...

I Note...

📝 Satya Nadella Blogs – To me, the content is less interesting – AI is gonna be big in 2026, you heard it here first! Though I do appreciate the ""scaffolding vs. substitute"" & ""slop vs. sophistication"" framing. And, of course, referencing the ""bicycles for the mind"" without mentioning you-know-who... – than the meta aspect of Nadella deciding to blog. Presumably, this is an attempt to establish some sort of ""thought leadership"" position as Microsoft navigates the extremely competitive AI waters. He perhaps even learned a thing or two from his friend Sam Altman, who oscillates between his own personal blog and OpenAI's official blog – or even other ones – seemingly on a whim. To that end, Nadella's post isn't a blog on an official Microsoft site or even Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, where many such thought leader-y posts are born, but instead on ""snscratchpad.com"" – there wasn't a better URL available?! That perhaps led it to fly under the radar, with Techmeme just posting it now, even though Nadella posted this a week ago. Maybe this was a new year's resolution to write more, which I can certainly appreciate! We'll see how long he keeps it up... [SN Scratchpad]

📱 OpenAI Latest App Store Attempt – Rolfe Winkler tried to use some of the initial apps in ChatGPT’s latest attempt to re-create the magic of the App Store. The result? Predictably not great. OpenAI says it’s early, which it is, but the real issue is how much easier/better it is to use the partners' services via their actual apps and/or websites. The App Store worked because it took advantage of a new device and form factor in the form of the iPhone. OpenAI’s hope here is to leverage the fact that people already have ChatGPT open, but these other apps really are just a click away, be it in another tab or another app. Which is to say, maybe this strategy works when OpenAI has their own device (if that device is compelling enough), but then again, Amazon has been trying that for years too without much success… I can see some business use cases here, but consumer use cases are going to remain a challenge unless OpenAI can figure out something truly novel (perhaps by using ChatGPT’s knowledge about you?)… [WSJ 🔒]

📽️ Hollywood Had A Slightly Better 2025 – $8.9B in ticket sales (in the US and Canada) was 2% better than 2024 — but such numbers are still down over 20% versus the pre-pandemic levels. And that’s before you take inflation into account. This naturally brings up the ""is this the new normal?"" question, which it probably is unless Hollywood actually does something to change the equation here. Netflix could help, but the industry will do everything in their power to stop that from happening so… Still, one of my predictions for the year is that the 2026 box office will be up pretty significantly, sequentially. And it may even touch those pre-pandemic numbers (again, before inflation). The slate looks that strong with franchises galore (not that those helped much this year). But it will likely be a mirage. Real change — reel change? — remains needed. [NYT]

🥽 Apple Cuts Vision Pro Production & Marketing – Many in Apple's orbit seem to be quick to call this latest report a ""nothingburger"" – mainly in that it's nothing new (IDC's market report notes that Luxshare halted production last year), but I would just note that the company did ship an updated version of the device since then (also IDC's sales estimates do keep falling below even their muted expectations). Sure, it was a small spec upgrade, but many Apple updates are and they still manage to move needles year to year – that does not seem to be the case with Vision Pro. IDC believes they shipped just 45k units in the holiday quarter; Apple sells something like 600k iPhones and about 60k Macs a day. Still, I think that small update was probably the right strategy with the product already in market (they should have launched it as a dev kit, not a full-on consumer product in its current state, but we're way past that now...). Rather than seeing them try to do a lighter/slightly cheaper Vision Pro right now, I'd rather see them meet Meta in the market for Smart Glasses (which is clearly happening). And build up from there. There's just still no real market for headsets yet – Meta dominates it, but even they're seemingly pulling back. [FT 🔒]

📺 Versant Lives! – And more importantly, the now-spun-off new public company sets a potential price for WBD's television assets, which could ultimately make or break the Netflix deal. Right now, Comcast's old TV assets look to be valued by the market somewhere around $6B. At 4.5x forward-earnings, that would make WBD's assets worth... a lot. But it's not that straightforward because those assets are also going to be saddled with... a lot of debt. So at least right now, we're... likely somewhere between what Paramount thinks they are worth and what WBD (and Netflix) thinks they are worth... Funny that. (Don't be shocked if Paramount raises their offer.) [THR]

I Quote...

""Labubu doesn’t actually have that much of a story behind it, it’s just a strange-looking doll.""

— Chris Pereira, founder of consultancy iMpact, noting that Pop Mart, the Beijing-based company behind the phenomenon, needs to focus on evolving the brand, lest we hit ""Peak Labubu"" (which we may have already). Currently, the company is focused on expanding their retail footprint around the world. And yes, the movie is coming, directed by Paddington helmer Paul King, for Sony…

China’s box office shot up over 20% to $7.4B (roughly $1.5B behind the US per above) — largely on the back of two sequels, one local, one not: Ne Kha 2 (China’s biggest movie ever at $2.13B) and Disney’s Zootopia 2 (now Hollywood's biggest movie in China ever). Both, of course, are animated. [Variety]

I Spy...

Everyone has long joked about how CBS was the ""old person's network"", but it really is wild seeing these two charts side-by-side.

The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.
Rubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services.
Named for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert.
According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops.","Today at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang officially launched the company’s new Rubin computing architecture, which he described as the state of the art in AI hardware. The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.

“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.”

The Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024, is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.

Rubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services. Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Named for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.

Explaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems.

“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”

As expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.

Rubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2219673294.jpg?resize=1200,750",N,,2026-01-05 19:01:58.453381

So, are curling irons banned on flights, and does the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mention them on its website?","Delta Air Lines has recently been in the news for several reasons. Last week, the airline announced it would soon stop flying to Greater Binghamton Airport (BGM), leaving this facility without carriers. Delta Air Lines has also recently issued an apology after flight 2150 diverted to Atlanta.

Now, the company is once again in the news, but this time it’s because of its passengers. A Delta Air Lines customer was recently filmed while ironing her hair on a flight.

Here is a closer look at what happened, what users have said about the video, and whether this is illegal.

Delta Passenger Caught Using Curling Iron Mid-Flight

On Wednesday, December 31, a TikTok user posted a video that immediately caught the attention of thousands. The footage starts with the creator filming herself, then slightly moving the camera to show the passenger sitting next to her.

The woman is shown calmly curling her hair in mid-flight. The footage also displays the following sentence: “Middle seat curling iron at 30,000 feet is a bold choice.”

The video has already been watched by hundreds of thousands of people, and as of Monday, January 5, it has 176.2k likes and over 3.3k comments. The user who shared the footage also added a caption, tagging Delta and stating, “This feels dangerous.” So, what are TikTok users saying about this hazardous behavior?

Several People Shared Their Shock About The Passenger’s Behavior

The passenger's behavior seems part of a common trend, as people on social media continue to share videos of themselves flying with heatless curl devices to arrive at their final destination with the perfect look. Yet, there’s a massive difference between using heatless curl tools and a curling iron plugged into one of the plane’s outlets.

Plenty of other users commented on the video, sharing their reaction. For instance, a user commented, ""What’s wrong with yall? This is crazy."" Another wrote, ""This is actually insane,"" while many seemed interested in where the passenger plugged in the iron. However, Delta Air Lines has AC power outlets on most of its seats, making it relatively easy to use such devices. Yet, this doesn’t mean curling your hair mid-flight is a wise choice.

Several flight attendants left a comment stating that this is not allowed.

“Flight attendant here, you can't do that. Those outlets aren't meant for things like this,” a TikTok user wrote in a comment.

Some people also left funny comments, such as a user who wrote, “She’s focused on her and you’re focused on her. She is the main character in every life.” Other people pointed out her curling technique, stating that the section of hair was too large.

Unfortunately, these risky behaviors seem to be increasing.

“There was a literal announcement from the pilot on my last flight that the plug ins on planes are for phones only and to not curl straighten or blow dry your hair,” A TikTok user wrote in the comments.

So, are curling irons banned on flights, and does the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mention them on its website?

Are Curling Iron Banned On Planes?

The FAA official website states that cordless curling irons that use a hydrocarbon gas, such as butane, are allowed only in carry-on baggage. However, there is a limit, as each traveler can bring only one of these items.

The website also specifies that a safety cover must be securely fitted over the heating element of cordless curling irons. Furthermore, “The device must be protected from accidental activation.”

However, when it comes to electric curling irons and hair straighteners equipped with cord plugs, like the one shown in the video, there seems to be no restrictions. Yet, this doesn’t mean curling your hair mid-flight is acceptable.

​​​​​​

In this regard, a pilot left a comment under the video, reminding viewers of the fire risk and advising the user filming to call the cabin crew to stop the hazardous behavior.

So, are curling irons banned on planes? It seems that, for now, there is no clear regulation regarding these devices, though this may change soon as more people continue to exhibit dangerous behavior on board.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/passengers-on-a-delta-airlines-flight.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:42.935962

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.55 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

Albertsons (ACI) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $24.88 billion vs analyst estimates of $24.72 billion (2.5% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat)

Adjusted EPS: $0.55 vs analyst estimates of $0.54 (in line)

Adjusted EBITDA: $1.11 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.09 billion (4.5% margin, 1.9% beat)

Operating Margin: 1.8%, in line with the same quarter last year

Free Cash Flow Margin: 0.7%, down from 1.7% in the same quarter last year

Locations: 2,264 at quarter end, down from 2,269 in the same quarter last year

Same-Store Sales rose 2.8% year on year (1.4% in the same quarter last year)

Market Capitalization: $9.51 billion

""In the second quarter, we delivered solid operating and financial results while continuing to invest in our core business and elevate the customer experience,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer.

Company Overview

With over 20 well-known grocery banners spanning 34 states, Albertsons ACI operates food and drug retail stores across the US, offering groceries, pharmacy services, and own-brand products under banners like Safeway, Jewel-Osco, and Vons.

Revenue Growth

A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years.

With $81.01 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Albertsons is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Albertsons to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.

As you can see below, Albertsons’s 3.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was sluggish as its store footprint remained unchanged.

This quarter, Albertsons reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and suggests its newer products will help support its historical top-line performance.

Store Performance

Number of Stores

A retailer’s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.

Albertsons operated 2,264 locations in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, has kept its store count flat while other consumer retail businesses have opted for growth.

When a retailer keeps its store footprint steady, it usually means demand is stable and it’s focusing on operational efficiency to increase profitability.

Same-Store Sales

A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it’s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales gives us insight into this topic because it measures organic growth for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year.

Albertsons’s demand rose over the last two years and slightly outpaced the industry. On average, the company’s same-store sales have grown by 2.2% per year. Given its flat store base over the same period, this performance stems from not only increased foot traffic at existing locations but also higher e-commerce sales as demand shifts from in-store to online.

In the latest quarter, Albertsons’s same-store sales rose 2.8% year on year. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.

Key Takeaways from Albertsons’s Q2 Results

It was encouraging to see Albertsons beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $17.25 immediately following the results.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 00:57:51.922872

That’s a wrap for NVIDIA’s CES 2026 presentation.","CES 2026 is here!

Kicking things off for the major chipmakers today is NVIDIA, who is at the show to talk about all things AI – a hot topic across the entire industry at the moment.

NVIDIA CES 2026 Keynote Live Coverage Preview

As with most of NVIDIA’s major presentations, company CEO (and leather jacket enthusiast) Jensen Huang will be headlining NVIDIA’s CES keynote. Also as is usually the case, NVIDIA is being fairly mum about what they will be talking about ahead of the presentation, beyond the fact that it’s all going to be AI-related. And despite being a consumer show, it sounds like the keynote may be limited more towards Enterprise offerings, as NVIDIA’s GeForce group has a separate presentation scheduled for 9pm Pacific this evening. A presentation in which the GeForce group is already setting expectations by stating that there will be no new GPUs announced.

Unlike 2025, where NVIDIA helmed CES’s prime keynote spot, in 2026 they are a bit of an outlier. Officially, the event is not even a keynote open to all attendees, but rather a press conference limited to the media. And it’s not taking place in the Mandalay Bay or Venetian hotels – where most official CES events happen – but rather out at the Fontainebleau hotel. So NVIDIA is a bit off the beaten path this year, running their own press conference at their own hotel. Even the scheduling of the event was relatively late, with NVIDIA not publicly announcing the event until December.

As for what NVIDIA may have up their sleeve this year, NVIDIA’s enterprise hardware schedule calls for 2026 to be the year of Vera Rubin, with that hardware shipping at some point during the year. As well, NVIDIA always has new software to talk about since development of that is largely decoupled from their hardware. But how much they’ll have to say at a more generic venue like CES remains to be seen.

NVIDIA’s keynote kicks off at 1:00pm PST / 4:00pm EST / 21:00 UTC, and according to NVIDIA’s calendar hold, this should be a pretty meaty keynote that runs for about 90 minutes. So please join us in a bit for our live blog coverage of NVIDIA’s CES 2026 keynote.

(And, as always, please excuse any typos stemming from our live coverage)

NVIDIA CES 2025 Keynote Coverage Live

At this point it’s 6 minutes after the hour, and we’re still waiting on NVIDIA to get started. One thing that is in NVIDIA’s favor this year is that since this is not an official CES keynote, they should be able to get right to their presentation without the wrap-around CES/CTA introductions.

Another 6 minutes in and we’re still waiting. For better or worse, we’re not actually in Vegas to cover these keynotes. But it also means I can’t check in with the sportsbook to see what the odds are on NVIDIA starting with another “I am AI” video.

And with that said, here we go!

It looks like we are starting with a montage of GPU rendering and simulation technologies instead. RTX graphics, NVIDIA’s various robotics and physics simulation frameworks, etc.

And here’s Jensen.

3000 people in the auditorium, and another 3000 people in overflow rooms. Not to mention everyone watching the stream.

“Every 15 years the industry resets”

New platforms arise, and new applications get written for those platforms.

This time there are two platform shifts going on. Not just the shift to GPUs, but how applications are even developed. They’re not programmed, they’re trained.

“Computing has been fundamentally reshaped as a result of accelerated computing, as a result of artificial intelligence.”

The modernization of AI is attracting enormous amounts of investment into NVIDIA’s industry.

Jensen is recapping a busy 2025 for NVIDIA – and a larger recap of NVIDIA’s history with AI. As well as the phases of AI models and the rise of reasoning models.

2025 was the year of proliferation for “agentic” models that can do higher level reasoning. NVIDIA is betting big on agentic systems becoming important tools in processing data and providing services.

Finally, 2025 was the year of the proliferation of open models. Which makes AI technology more accessible to everyone.

“This entire industry is going to be reshaped because of that.”

NVIDIA has been making their own investments into open models. Which, in turn, has been what they’ve been using their array of company-owned DGX SuperPOD to train and develop.

“NVIDIA is a frontier AI model builder.” NVIDIA wants to enable every company to be part of the AI revolution.

NVIDIA’s models top the leaderboards in terms of performance and other metrics. All in service of helping NVIDIA’s customers develop AI agents.

Now on to reasoning, and how it is changing the face of AI models. To be able to reason beyond just what it has been explicitly trained on.

Building on top of that is multi-model and multi-modal agents, which can call each other based on their specialization and training.

Now rolling a video showing a short example of building a personal assistant using NVIDIA’s hardware and frameworks.

“The amazing thing is that is utterly trivial now.” But it would have been unimaginable a couple of years ago.

(Jensen has not been having much luck with his presentation screen and slide deck today)

Regardless, this is the future Jensen wants to move to. Development is tying together frameworks based on models that have already been trained to handle specific tasks, with further training and reasoning to expand the capabilities of these systems.

“The agentic system is the interface.”

And that is Enterprise AI being revolutionized by agentic systems.

Now on to physical AI.

A big challenge for physical AIs: object permanence. It’s not just learning the laws of the physical world, but keeping track of things that may not be their focus.

The hardware to make all of this happen is a trio of computers. Training on NVIDIA’s big iron hardware, inference at the edge with things like Thor, and then physical simulations using RTX Pro servers.

Jensen is also recapping the various models/frameworks NVIDIA offers for the task. Cosmos and Gr00t, which have been around for a couple of years now, and what appears to be a new model: Alpamayo.

Now rolling a video about Cosmos, NVIDIA’s physical AI simulation framework and world foundation model.

Cosmos can generate realistic video from images, and physically accurate simulations from 3D models. Even scenario prompts are enough to generate a video. “Cosmos turns compute into data.”

Cosmos has already been downloaded millions of times. And NVIDIA uses it internally for their self-driving automotive tech.

Announcing today: Alpamayo. The world’s first thinking and reasoning automotive AI.

Alpamayo isn’t just an AI for self-driving cars. But it is an AI that can explain why it is doing what it is doing, and its reasoning process that led to that decision.

Now rolling another video, this time of self-driving automotive tech. All hands-free and taken in a single long shot.

(The future of San Francisco is to be a city of robots)

NVIDIA’s video is interspersed with quotes. From what I gather, it sounds like they’ve been driving journalists around in their cars.

“We started working on self-driving cars 8 years ago”

Alpamayo is open source.

(This is the most enthusiastic I’ve seen Jensen about self-driving cars in a few years now)

The combination of NVIDIA hardware, frameworks, and now Alpamayo is the company’s first complete stack for self-driving cars.

Jensen thinks this will be one of the largest robotics industries.

Mercedes Benz CLA just went into production. It has already been rated the “world’s safest car” by one group.

Parallel to Alpamayo is the safety system that validates everything that Alpamayo does. Something that apparently took NVIDIA half a decade to build.

“We’re going to maintain the stack for as long as we shall live”

Note that the emphasis is on L4 vehicles, not L5 fully autonomous vehicles.

Ultimately, most everything here developed for self-driving automotive can also be applied to other forms of robotics.

NVIDIA is once again showing off the proof-of-concept droids they’ve been developing over the past couple of years. As well as how they were trained inside of a physically-accurate simulated environment.

How do you learn to be a robot? You do it all inside of Omniverse.

“We’re going to talk a lot more about robotics in the future”

NVIDIA has said before that they see robotics as the next great market for the company. Hence the heavy investment into robotics.

Jensen is now going on a tangent about chip design – which like everything else is becoming AI accelerated. So even the chips going into Jensen’s robots are going to be created in a simulation.

Now rolling a video about working with Siemens.

And now on to some hardware. Vera Rubin.

But first, a quick recap on the history of Vera Rubin the astronomer, and why NVIDIA named their next platform after her.

Vera Rubin is designed to address the insane demand for AI computing.

The number of tokens needed for cutting-edge inference has exploded, especially with the rise of thinking/reasoning models. And the race is on for AI to get to the next frontier.

All the while the cost per token continues to drop, making the higher number of tokens required economically viable.

NVIDIA is in full scale manufacturing of GB300 right now. And Vera Rubin will ship this year. Vera Rubin is in full production.

Now rolling a video about Vera Rubin.

1 Vera CPU + 2 Rubin GPUs.

The first Vera Rubin NVL72 rack is online.

“Moore’s Law has largely slowed”. So NVIDIA cannot keep up by just throwing more transistors at hardware. At least if they want to keep up their current pace.

So NVIDIA had to redesign all of their core chips in a single generation in order to improve performance and add functionality to keep up with client needs.

Despite only having 88 CPU cores, each one of the 176 threads on Vera can get its full performance. It is effectively a 176 core CPU.

NVIDIA has to employ extreme co-design across all of its chips in order to hit its performance goals.

Now talking about FP4 capabilities, and specifically NVIDIA’s NVFP4 format. Achieving higher throughput when the lower precision is acceptable, and using higher precision when required. All of which is handled adaptively.

And all of this is delivered with just 1.6x as many transistors for Vera Rubin versus Grace Blackwell.

The Vera Rubin compute tray is cable-free. The assembly time is down from 2 hours to 6 minutes. It is also 100% liquid cooled, versus just 80% for the Grace Blackwell compute tray.

Tying all of this together is NVIDIA’s family of networking hardware. ConnectX-9 NICs, BlueField 4 DPUs, and Spectrum-X networking platform. Networking performance has been critical in enabling scale-out scaling of NVIDIA GPU systems.

Spectrum-X is for East-West traffic, while BlueField 4 is for North-South traffic. BlueField 4 comes standard with every one of the Vera Rubin compute nodes.

NVLink 6 Switch chip employs 400G SerDes. Twice the speed of NVLink 5, and twice the speed of most everything else. So that every GPU can talk to every other GPU at the same time.

(Apparently they forgot to drain the water out of the NVL72 demo system before shipping it)

NVIDIA’s SerDes drive cables form the top of the rack to the bottom. 2 miles of copper cables in NVL72. The NVLink spine.

Vera Rubin’s power consumption is twice as high as Grace Blackwell. But NVIDIA is able to cool it with 45C water?!

NVL72 will offer 5x the inference performance, and 3.5x the training performance.

Spectrum-X chip with silicon photonics. 512 200G ports.

NVIDIA’s co-packaged optics technology was developed in conjunction with TSMC. It is essentially how NVIDIA is making faster optical networking speeds economically viable at the scale they need for a supercomputer.

Now in a segue to talking about tokens and key value (KV) caching.

Inference generates a massive amount of context data – too much to keep on AI nodes. That data either must be tossed and recomputed, or a way is found to efficiently store it.

Enter NVIDIA’s Context Memory Storage Platform.

All made possible with NVIDIA’s ConnectX and BlueField networking products.

All combined, this makes up a Vera Rubin pod.

In other news, the entire system is now capable of confidential computing. Blackwell was previously capable of confidential computing, but Grace was not. Now, Vera is, meaning it can work in concert with Rubin to allow for confidential computing (encryption) over the whole rack/pod.

Rubin can train an example model in 1/4 of the time. Or constant time with 1/4 as many GPUs.

And very quickly recapping NVIDIA’s announcements. That’s a wrap for NVIDIA’s CES 2026 presentation.",https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NVIIDA-CES-2026-Live-Blog-Hero.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 18:02:18.923783

Build Your Own Adobe Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?","In early January 2026, Jefferies downgraded Adobe to Hold, citing slower topline trends since fiscal 2023 and limited near-term revenue impact from its artificial intelligence offerings.

This move has sharpened attention on whether Adobe’s growing AI usage and integrations can translate into material, measurable revenue contributions amid rising competition.

Next, we’ll examine how Jefferies’ concerns about Adobe’s AI monetization and growth trajectory may reshape the company’s existing investment narrative.

We've found 14 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.

Adobe Investment Narrative Recap

To own Adobe today, you need to believe its creative and document software, now infused with AI, can keep customers loyal and willing to pay for subscriptions even as competition intensifies. The key near term catalyst is clearer AI monetization in products like Firefly and Acrobat AI Assistant; Jefferies’ downgrade highlights that this remains unproven in revenue terms. The biggest current risk is that faster moving AI rivals pressure Adobe’s growth and pricing power over time.

Piper Sandler’s recent reiteration of an Overweight rating and its comments on AI influenced annual recurring revenue above US$8,000,000,000 sit in sharp contrast to Jefferies’ caution. That update underscores how much of the Adobe debate now hinges on whether rising AI usage and credit consumption eventually show up as sustainable, incremental revenue, or simply deepen the value of the existing subscription base without materially speeding top line growth.

Yet beneath Adobe’s strong AI story, there is a growing concern investors should be aware of regarding intensifying competition and potential pricing pressure...

Read the full narrative on Adobe (it's free!)

Adobe's narrative projects $29.3 billion revenue and $8.7 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 9.0% yearly revenue growth and about a $1.8 billion earnings increase from $6.9 billion today.

Uncover how Adobe's forecasts yield a $447.56 fair value, a 34% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Some of the most optimistic analysts had been assuming Adobe could reach about US$31,200,000,000 in revenue and US$11,400,000,000 in earnings by 2028, but Jefferies’ AI monetization concerns highlight how quickly that upbeat view could be challenged and why you should compare these contrasting forecasts before deciding what you believe.

How does Nvidia keep its car safe?

Nvidia says it has spent years building an entire AV stack that's fully traceable, running both stacks at the same time as a guardrail against accidents and scenarios you can't legislate against. A real shot across Tesla's bow.

More Alpamayo - coming to Mercedes Benz CLA

""Not only does your car drive as you would expect it to drive, it reasons about every scenario and tells you what it's about to do.""

The first AV car powered by Alpamayo is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA, shipping to the U.S. in Q1. It has been rated as the world's safest car by NCAP.

Nvidia Alpamayo: A thinking, reasoning AI model for vehicles

Powered by the Cosmos AI model, Nvidia has created Alpamayo, an AI model used for autonomous vehicles. It can reason every action: From the actions it's about to take, how it reasoned that action, and then developing a trajectory.

Huang claims that it's based on a large amount of human training and supplemented by Cosmos' synthetic data. The keynote has now shifted to a real-world example of the model working in action, with a car (in San Francisco) taking turns and making decisions on the fly. Huang notes that it's impossible to get every single possible scenario, but breaking these tasks down can be understood by the AI model if it reasons through it.

Full-stack Phsyical AI: Compute becomes data

Jensen is explaining how several computers, connected through Nvidia Omniverse, can create a full-stack AI platform through training (GB300), Simulation (RTX Pro), and inference (labelled THOR). By utilizing multiple models aligned with language, compute power has become data, Jensen says.

Synthetic data, grounded by physics, can be used in a Cosmos foundation model to become physically-based, digestible data to train a new AI platform. This could curtail the requirement for real-world training data for Physical AI platforms, aligning elements like trajectory predictions into real-world, usable data for training.

Nvidia Brev: Creating closed agentic sandboxes

Using a new tool called Nvidia Brev, the company has demoed an environement that can hook up to a DGX spark inside a closed environment for a variety of AI applications, or connecting it to frontier models via HuggingFace. A couple of examples were given, including integrating it with robotics.

""Isn't that incredible?"", Jensen remarks, before mentioning that just a few years ago, it would have been impossible. Thanks to using a variety of applications, named an Agentic framework, Brev creates the architecture of applications across a closed sandbox.

— Sayem Ahmed

AI tops leaderboards across the industry

Nvidia's models are topping leaderboards, with the hopes that it can make developers utilize and create AI agents in order to research, models, and more easily. With reasoning capabilities, AI models no longer have to understand everything in a single day.

Jensen mentioned Perplecity as an example of how it would create an AI reasoning chain to create a multi-model, making just about anything fit a certain task, which has empowered AI startups — all thanks to Nvidia's technology, of course.

— Jeffrey Kampman

Nvidia's focus on frontier models across industries

Huang reiterated that it's not a cloud distribution service, as DGX cloud winds down to R&D, it's now focused on developing frontier models like Earth 2, Cosmos, a world foundation model, GR00T for robotics and locomotion, and more.

Huang states that he open-sources these models, but also the datasets behind them, so developers understand what makes things tick, with the intention for every company to take part in the incoming AI developments. And just like that, the lights go out, and Jensen makes a joke.

— Jeffrey Kampman

Inventing a new world with AI

100 trillion dollars of industry investment is shifting over to AI, or so Jensen Huang claims. The CEO states that R&D budgets are now pouring in, perhaps to cool down claims of circular funding in the AI industry. The CEO is now shifting the conversation into a history lesson for AI models, reiterating that Agentic models like Cursor are a focus for 2026 and beyond.

— Sayem Ahmed

Jensen Huang takes to the stage

Slightly later than expected, the show has now officially begun, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang taking the stage to lay out what 2026 and beyond might hold for Nvidia. Expect Nvidia to press on topics like AI, data centers, and robotics. While it might not be quite as exciting as the launch of a new consumer graphics card, whatever is announced over the course of the keynote will likely set the tone for the rest of the industry to follow for the rest of the year.

— Sayem Ahmed

Nvidia is late to its own party

Despite a slick preshow, Nvidia has yet to officially commence its keynote, running around ten minutes later than anticipated. You'd think that with the vast resources available to Nvidia, they'd run on time. Perhaps an AI model running a calendar hallucinated somewhere?

Regardless, the industry is waiting with bated breath for things to kick off, and we'll be right here reporting the latest, as it happens.

— Sayem Ahmed

The preshow is over: T-minus 3 minutes until the keynote begins

The preshow is now over, and Huang is expected to take the stage in three minutes to kick things off in earnest. Being rolled onto the stage is a high-resolution screen, with some semi-dramatic music playing, and we'll expect to hear more shortly. While this is fun, what are the odds that the music is AI-generated?

There may be some expectation that Huang will emerge carrying some kind of object. We've seen him roll out with robots and even a shield made of chips before; surely the company has the cash for more than just a new leather jacket.

— Sayem Ahmed

Nvidia preshow kicks off CES festivities

While Jensen Huang hasn't taken to the stage yet, Nvidia has a 'pre-game' show, where its showing a manner of applications that use Nvidia tech, complete with an interview panel ahead of time. While it's a neat warm-up, don't expect anything too staggering while things are still kicking off.

Huang is set to take the stage at 1 p.m. PT, so there's not too long to wait until we get to the real meat of today's keynote.

— Sayem Ahmed

It's Jensen's world, and we're just living in it

In 2025, Nvidia had one of its best years to date. It launched the RTX 50 series, and its data center profits skyrocketed. However, 2026 paints a very different picture. With the AI industry booming, and hyperscalers shovelling investment into new data centers like there's no tomorrow, the industry is waiting with bated breath to see exactly what course Huang might plot for 2026 and beyond. Needless to say, the entire industry will hear the reverberations.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.55 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

""In the second quarter, we delivered solid operating and financial results while continuing to invest in our core business and elevate the customer experience,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer.

Company Overview

With over 20 well-known grocery banners spanning 34 states, Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) operates food and drug retail stores across the US, offering groceries, pharmacy services, and own-brand products under banners like Safeway, Jewel-Osco, and Vons.

Revenue Growth

A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years.

With $81.01 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Albertsons is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Albertsons to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.

As you can see below, Albertsons’s 3.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was sluggish as its store footprint remained unchanged.

This quarter, Albertsons reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and suggests its newer products will help support its historical top-line performance.

Store Performance

Number of Stores

A retailer’s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.

Albertsons operated 2,264 locations in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, has kept its store count flat while other consumer retail businesses have opted for growth.

When a retailer keeps its store footprint steady, it usually means demand is stable and it’s focusing on operational efficiency to increase profitability.

Same-Store Sales

A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it’s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales gives us insight into this topic because it measures organic growth for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year.

Albertsons’s demand rose over the last two years and slightly outpaced the industry. On average, the company’s same-store sales have grown by 2.2% per year. Given its flat store base over the same period, this performance stems from not only increased foot traffic at existing locations but also higher e-commerce sales as demand shifts from in-store to online.

In the latest quarter, Albertsons’s same-store sales rose 2.8% year on year. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.

Key Takeaways from Albertsons’s Q2 Results

It was encouraging to see Albertsons beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $17.25 immediately following the results.",https://assets.barchart.com/img/barchart-og.png,N,,2026-01-05 17:02:00.791878

FDA Accepts NDA for Low-Sodium Oxybate TRN-257 in Narcolepsy and Idiopathic Hypersomnia

At the beginning of the month, on December 9, 2025, the FDA accepted Tris Pharma’s new drug application (NDA) for TRN-257 for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy, as well as excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with idiopathic hypersomnia, with a PDUFA date set for June 20, 2026.1 The agent incorporates 2 of the company’s proprietary technology platforms, RaftWorks and LiquiXR, to achieve a controlled-release profile and support a once-nightly, low-sodium dosing regimen.

The NDA submission is supported by data from multiple pharmacokinetic and safety studies and incorporates Model-Informed Drug Development-based approaches to showcase the efficacy and safety of TRN-257. According to Tris Pharma, the submission also references the agency's prior safety and efficacy findings for currently marketed oxybate products. In addition, it includes a comprehensive Human Factors Engineering and Usability Engineering study report, which demonstrated that representative patients were generally able to perform tasks and use TRN-257 as intended when following the proposed labeling.

""Currently, patients face a difficult trade-off with existing treatments that either burden them with high sodium levels, posing significant cardiovascular risks, or require disruptive twice-nightly dosing that interrupts sleep, that otherwise is intended to induce sleep,"" Maurice M. Ohayon, MD, DSc, PhD, professor and director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center at Stanford University, said in a statement.1 ""As the first oxybate formulation to combine a convenient once-nightly regimen with the lowest sodium content, TRN-257 is uniquely designed to eliminate this compromise.""

FDA Clears Pivotal Phase 3 PREVAiLS Study of Pridopidine in Early, Rapidly Progressive ALS

A couple of days later, on December 11, 2025, the FDA cleared the initiation of a pivotal, 500-patient, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial dubbed PREVAiLS, which will assess the efficacy and safety of pridopidine (Prilenia Therapeutics/Ferrer) in patients with early-stage, rapidly progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The company noted that recruitment at the first clinical trial sites in the United States is planned to begin in early 2026, with international sites expected to follow pending regulatory approval.2

PREVAiLS will enroll adults diagnosed with definite or probable ALS who are within 18 months of symptom onset across up to 60 ALS treatment centers worldwide. The trial design consists of a 48-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, randomized 3:2 to receive either pridopidine or placebo, followed by a 48-week open-label extension. The primary end point is change from baseline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R), adjusted for mortality, at 48 weeks while secondary and exploratory end points include measures of speech, respiratory and bulbar function, quality of life, survival, patient-reported outcomes, and plasma biomarkers.

“This study has the clear aim of evaluating the efficacy and safety of a much-needed new treatment option for ALS,” PREVAiLS steering committee member and investigator Sabrina Paganoni, MD, PhD, co-director of Massachusetts General Hospital Neurological Clinical Research Institute, said in a statement.2 “Early detection and management are essential for preserving function, with slowing of functional decline, maintaining speech and prolonging survival being ALS therapeutic priorities. This makes pridopidine’s S1R activation mechanism of particular interest, holding promise in ALS by enhancing key cellular mechanisms and promoting neuroprotection.""

FDA Approves Inebilizumab for AChR- and MuSK-Positive Generalized Myasthenia Gravis

On the same day, on December 11, 2025, the FDA approved inebilizumab (Uplizna; Amgen) for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are antiacetylcholine receptor (AChR) and antimuscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive. This marks the third FDA-approved indication for inebilizumab, following approvals in antiaquaporin-4 antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and immunoglobulin G4–related disease.3

The approval of inebilizumab for gMG is supported by data from the phase 3 MINT trial (NCT04524273). In the trial, 238 patients with gMG were randomly assigned 1:1 to either intravenous ineblizumab 300 mg (n = 119) or placebo (n = 119) for a 12-month period. Change from baseline in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MD-ADL), the study’s primary end point, was statistically significant for inebilizumab-treated patients, with scores of –4.2 compared with –2.2 for those on placebo (P <.0001). The therapy showed a safe and well tolerated profile, consistent with prior safety findings.

""This approval is a truly meaningful milestone – personally, as the global principal investigator for MINT, and most importantly, for the many patients who will benefit. I’m thrilled to see a new FDA-approved option for patients living with this rare and debilitating disease, and for the clinicians who care for them,"" global principal investigator Richard J. Nowak, MD, MS, director of the Myasthenia Gravis Clinic and associate professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine, told NeurologyLive®. ""This approval represents significant progress for the gMG community and adds an important new option to the clinical toolbox.""

Tolebrutinib Falls Short in Phase 3 PERSEUS Study, Forcing Decision to Redact Regulatory Submission

A few days later, on December 15, 2025, Sanofi’s tolebrutinib, an investigational Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, did not meet its end points in the phase 3 PERSEUS study (NCT04458051) of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), and a regulatory submission is therefore not expected. In addition, it’s been reported that the FDA has pushed back its review of the agent as a treatment for nonrelapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS).4

More detailed results from the global, double-blind, randomized trial are expected to be presented at an upcoming meeting. In the release, it was noted that tolebrutinib did not meet its primary end point of delaying time of onset of 6-month composite confirmed disability progression (CDP) compared with placebo in the study cohort, which included those aged 18-55 with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of between 2.0 and 6.5.

""We are disappointed by today’s results; however, we do believe that these results will improve our understanding of the underlying disease biology of multiple sclerosis,"" Houman Ashrafian, executive vice president and head of Research & Development at Sanofi, said in a statement.4 ""We extend our deepest appreciation to the study participants, their families, and healthcare professionals who support our scientific and innovative vision. Our commitment to the multiple sclerosis community remains unchanged, as do our efforts to pursue novel advancements that address existing unmet needs and we remain confident in the value tolebrutinib can bring to those living with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.""

FDA Expands Indication for n‐Butyl Cyanoacrylate in Chronic Subdural Hematoma

A few days later, on December 18, 2025, the FDA approved the expanded indication for Johnson & Johnson's n‐butyl cyanoacrylate (Trufill) liquid embolic system as an adjunct to surgery for middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization in patients with symptomatic subacute and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). The company noted that therapy has been used in neurovascular embolization for more than 25 years and has supported the treatment of arteriovenous malformations since its initial FDA approval in 2000.5

The approval was supported by findings from the MEMBRANE randomized controlled trial (NCT04816591), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of MMA embolization in approximately 376 adult patients with cSDH. In trial, researchers observed a statistically significant treatment benefit with n-butyl cyanoacrylate compared with standard of care in patients treated with or without surgery (P = .044).2 Overall, the study demonstrated superior efficacy of n-butyl cyanoacrylate and supported its safety in the treatment of cSDH.

“The MEMBRANE trial provides high-quality evidence that treating the subdural membrane itself with MMA embolization with Trufill nBCA as an adjunct to surgery prevents recurrence in patients with chronic subdural hematomas,"" investigator Chris Kellner, MD, the director of Cerebrovascular & Intercerebral Hemorrhage programs at Mount Sinai told NeurologyLive®. "" We are proud at Mount Sinai to have led the clinical trial and to partner with J&J in the future to train neurointerventionists and educate the community about this new treatment.""

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-05 19:42:06+00:00,Fortune,"After Nvidia's Groq deal, these AI chip startups are in play—and one hoping to disrupt them all",Sharon Goldman,,,,,https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-groq-deal-ai-chip-startups-in-play/,"It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.
Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models.
But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote.
A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.” Still, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally.
His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.","The Groq deal bolsters the standing of other startups building their own AI chips, including Cerebras, D-Matrix, and SambaNova—which Intel has reportedly signed a term sheet to acquire—as well as newer players like U.K.-based chip startup Fractile. It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.

Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research, pointed to the Microsoft-backed D-Matrix, which raised $275 million last month at a $2 billion valuation. Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models. “I’m sure D-Matrix is a pretty happy startup right now,” Freund said. “I suspect their next round will be at a much higher valuation.”

Cerebras, another inference-focused chip company, also appears well positioned. Known for its dinner-plate-sized “wafer-scale” chip designed to run extremely large models on a single piece of silicon, Cerebras has filed for an IPO after a previous delay. Freund said the company has increasingly been viewed as a potential acquisition target as well. “You don’t want to wait until after the IPO, when it’s more expensive,” he said. “From that perspective, Cerebras is sitting pretty right now.”

Nvidia-Groq deal has clarified market’s direction

Executives at these companies say Nvidia’s move has helped clarify the market’s direction. “When [the Nvidia-Groq deal] happened, we said, ‘Finally, the market recognizes it,’” Sid Sheth, CEO of D-Matrix, told Fortune. “I think what Nvidia has really done is they said, Okay, this approach is a winning approach.”

And Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman posted on X that, in the past, the perception that Nvidia GPUs were all you needed for AI acted as a moat, keeping AI chip startups for nibbling away at Nvidia’s marketshare. But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote. “It reflects a growing industry reality—the inference market is fragmenting, and a new category has emerged where speed isn’t a feature—it’s the entire value proposition. A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.”

Still, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said the chip sector remains a difficult one for venture investors, given the high capital requirements and long timelines. “A lot of VCs stopped investing in chips 10 or 15 years ago,” Murphy said. “It’s capital-intensive, it takes years to get a product out, and the outcomes are hard to predict.”

That said, he pointed to Fireworks, and AI inference platform which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October, as a startup with a technical advantage, thanks to a founding team filled with engineers who built Pytorch an. But he added that it remains unclear how much of the current enthusiasm reflects genuine technical differentiation. “it’s hard to tell who’s really got something significant versus the tide is [raising] all boats, which is what seems to be going on,” he said, adding that consolidation across the sector now appears increasingly likely.

New entrant seeks true disruption

But at least one veteran of the AI hardware world argues that even today’s inference-focused startups are not truly disruptive.

Naveen Rao, former SVP of AI at Databricks and founder of MosaicML, recently left Databricks to start Unconventional AI, which last month confirmed a massive $475 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures. His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.

After Nvidia’s Groq deal validated demand for faster, more efficient inference, startups that fit neatly into today’s AI stack suddenly look far more valuable — not because they reinvented computing, Rao argues, but because they work within it. Unconventional AI is pursuing a more radical path: building new hardware that exploits the physical behavior of silicon itself, and redesigning neural networks to match it.

“We’ve been building the same fundamental machine for 80 years, a numeric digital machine,” he said. “But there was never one workload that dominated even more than 2% of all compute cycles.” That is changing, he explained: In a few years, 95% of all compute will be used for AI.

From that standpoint, it’s important to construct an entirely different machine than what is built today, he said. However, Rao says the effort could take five years or more to bear fruit — and is not intended to capitalize on the current inference boom.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/54195259582_a575397bf5_o-e1738260860238.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-05 15:01:38.276701

To that point, she continued, “Nobody wants to see the same ad three times.” Most ad content, she added, “is dead on arrival after a week, maybe two weeks.
Now with AI – and with I want to put the word ‘responsible AI’ out there – you can do it in hours.
For example, there might be an advertiser who wants to be the first ad in an ad pod right after a holiday kiss.
How do we make that advertiser really, really relevant in that moment?” AI can create “a great marriage between the viewer and the advertiser experience,” Shepard added.","Senior execs from NBCUniversal, Amazon‘s AWS, Adobe and ad agency WPP discussed the tricky balance between embracing AI and safeguarding IP during a panel discussion Monday at CES.

“We’ve been talking about personalization for decades,” said Hannah Elsakr, VP of GenAI New Business Ventures at Adobe. To that point, she continued, “Nobody wants to see the same ad three times.” Most ad content, she added, “is dead on arrival after a week, maybe two weeks. … We’ve talked about a promo taking two-plus weeks to execute. Now with AI – and with I want to put the word ‘responsible AI’ out there – you can do it in hours.

Programmers and advertisers are “in a fight for attention,” Elsakr said. “So, being able to be relevant and let the fan drive the narrative, that, to me, is the new definition of personalization of the brand.”

Kristina Shepard, EVP of Streaming & Performance Sales & Partnerships at NBCU cited a number of initiatives at the media giant that are designed to take advantage of the speed of AI tools.

Buyers and sellers of ad time can now use AI “to get down, not just to a show or an episode, but to a scene level,” Shepard said. “Contextual targeting in some regard has gotten a bad rap because it has seemed very basic, right? An advertiser would say, ‘I want to reach women 25 to 54, give me the top 100 shows.’ Now, AI can allow us to actually identify scenes. For example, there might be an advertiser who wants to be the first ad in an ad pod right after a holiday kiss. How do we make that advertiser really, really relevant in that moment?”

AI can create “a great marriage between the viewer and the advertiser experience,” Shepard added. “We basically beta-tested this with a luxury brand, you know, doing contextual targeting in VOD content in 2026, you’ll see this in live” at upcoming NBCU events like the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics.

One scenario, she said, would be enabling creative messages to allude to what is happening in a live sporting event. “Imagine a touchdown happens in the third quarter of a game and that next ad pod says, ‘Congratulations for the touchdown brought you by said brand.'”

In the case of the luxury brand, she added, NBCU research found that viewers got 27% more enjoyment from that experience, and search engagement jumped 56% for the brand. Search and purchase intent, the so-called “lower funnel” parts of the advertising experience (as opposed to upper-funnel efforts to create awareness), are “the holy grail for all advertisers,” Shepard said. NBCU’s experience “shows the benefit that television can be both an upper and lower funnel medium.”

Samira Panah Bakhtiar, General Manager of Media & Entertainment, Games, and Sports at AWS, pointed to the larger context in which all viewing and advertising is occurring.

“I think we have to think about where the audiences are,” she said. “Gen Z right now is spending 54% more time on social and they’re spending 26% less time on traditional viewing experiences. And if you look at some of the creators right now who are really able to capitalize themselves in a marvelous way.” She cited Dude Perfect or Mr. Beast, whose valuations are “rivaling more traditional brands.”

The emergence of creators “isn’t just an anomaly. These are creators who have very, very loyal fan bases who have learned how to be able to really cultivate production level content and higher media executives and get institutional investment and have figured out ways to be able to only create that content, but distribute that content at scale.”

Any companies “seeking this to reinvent themselves, or be able to capitalize on this moment,” she said, need to “really pay attention to the multi-generational preferences that exist in the viewing sphere right now.”",https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2806-e1767638758106.jpeg?w=1024,N,,2026-01-05 15:13:58.140043

Parker Hannifin P/E Compared to Competitors

The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 39.37 in the Machinery industry, Parker Hannifin Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 31.85. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.

In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth.

Click to get this free report Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL): Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","Ralph Lauren (RL) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.

Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.

As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ralph Lauren is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.

Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices

The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.

For Ralph Lauren, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.

Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions

As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .

Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ralph Lauren

For the fiscal year ending March 2026, this upscale clothing company is expected to earn $15.29 per share, which is unchanged compared with the year-ago reported number.

Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ralph Lauren. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.3%.

Bottom Line

Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of ""buy"" and ""sell"" ratings for its entire universe of more than 4,000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a ""Strong Buy"" rating and the next 15% get a ""Buy"" rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

The upgrade of Ralph Lauren to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

Pharmacy Times: What changes in policy or practice are needed to expand the impact of psychiatric pharmacists in SUD treatment?
At the VA, where I practice, the states where I hold pharmacist licenses don’t allow pharmacists to have DEA licenses, and the requirements are very specific.
That said, psychiatric pharmacists bring so much value that integration into health systems should clearly be beneficial and cost-saving overall.
Overall, psychiatric pharmacists have a lot to offer, and that’s demonstrated by those working in the field every day.","Pharmacy Times: How do psychiatric pharmacists collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to improve SUD care and patient outcomes?

Aaron Salwan, PharmD, MPH, BCCP: We certainly talked about how we interface with physicians or prescribers. Another aspect that I don’t know if anyone appreciates, or has the same experience in a different specialty, is that we work very closely with case managers, social workers, and counselors. We could have the best idea for what medicine could be helpful, but if the patient has no way to access it, then it’s not useful at all.

I have a close relationship with our counselors and discharge planners, trying to ensure that as patients move from one phase of treatment to another, there’s not a lapse in care. Another, more clinical approach is that if I observe a patient in a group and see their behavior is different or has changed, and I can link it to a medication that was newly started or adjusted, that turns into more of an interdisciplinary conversation.

Instead of going directly to the physician and saying, “Hey, I think you need to do this,” it involves other members of the care team. We ask questions like, “Did you notice this?” or “I think this patient has this type of issue—what do you think?” It becomes truly collaborative before we pull the trigger on a change like that.

Pharmacy Times: What changes in policy or practice are needed to expand the impact of psychiatric pharmacists in SUD treatment?

Ashley Maister, PharmD, BCCP: As someone who practices with a scope of practice, I think the ability to do things—not necessarily independently—but to prescribe and get medication to the patient faster is really important. Being able to follow through on what we’ve already discussed and agreed to with the patient is critical. With the removal of the X-waiver, allowing psychiatric pharmacists, especially those working in substance use disorder clinics, to prescribe buprenorphine or controlled substances would improve continuity of care.

At the VA, where I practice, the states where I hold pharmacist licenses don’t allow pharmacists to have DEA licenses, and the requirements are very specific. If you’re not at the VA and you’re working in a state like Pennsylvania, you can’t, for example, have an Idaho pharmacist license. The federal umbrella helps in some ways, but it also adds extra expense and upkeep.

If pharmacists, regardless of the state where they practice, were able to have DEA licenses and independently initiate and manage buprenorphine, I think that would expand their impact and strengthen their role in patient follow-up.

Salwan: That’s exactly where my mind went as well—the ability to prescribe and have a DEA license. It does seem that laws have changed so pharmacists in nearly every state are able to administer long-acting injectables. I don’t know what the uptake has been, but there’s a need for reimbursement, so pharmacists in any setting are inclined to offer that service.

Many of the skills pharmacists provide aren’t always billable or tied to a diagnostic code that would make adding a psychiatric pharmacist to a clinic seem profitable. That said, psychiatric pharmacists bring so much value that integration into health systems should clearly be beneficial and cost-saving overall. From a more structural or infrastructure point of view, there also needs to be greater support for addiction services and harm reduction services.

This includes sterile syringe programs, drug testing devices, and access to Narcan or naloxone. These are things we can never have enough of given the needs of our population.

Its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO) made an announcement that shook up Lilly stock Monday.

Drugmakers are in stiff competition to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market oral weight-loss drugs vs. the current injectable treatments. Novo Nordisk hit a milestone Monday and pulled ahead in the battle.

Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound are in a class of medicines called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are designed to help lower blood sugar and support weight loss.

Lilly stock fell as Novo announced it will offer its new Wegovy weight-loss pill in the U.S. beginning Monday. Novo will sell the Wegovy pill at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies, including CVS Health (CVS) and Costco (COST), as well as its own direct outlet.

Eli Lilly makes weight-loss drugs, including Zepbound, a weekly injectable treatment. But Lilly has an investigational, once-daily oral medication named orforglipron that is being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Orforglipron is currently in clinical trials. Lilly said preliminary results for orforglipron have been positive, and additional data is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2026.

Eli Lilly is also on the IBD Big Cap 20 and an IBD Leaderboard watchlist name. It was an IBD SwingTrader holding, but was removed with Monday's drop.

Eli Lilly Stock Falls On Rival News

Eli Lilly stock reversed nearly 4% lower after initially rising to start Monday' session. Shares undercut their 21-day exponential moving average and are testing their 10-week moving average.

The drug stock sits in a newly formed first-stage flat base with a 1,111.99 buy point, according to MarketSurge pattern recognition. The buy point also stands as its all-time high, reached on Nov. 26. Lilly stock formed a bullish three-weeks pattern with a 1,088.48 entry point within the flat base.

The flat base formed after its rapid climb from a consolidation pattern breakout in early November, triggering ""Ants Indicators.""

Its relative strength line is falling with Monday's drop. But its IBD Timeliness Rating of A indicates potential positive relative price performance over the next 12 months.

Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A indicates heavy institutional buying over the last 13 weeks. And its beefy 2.2 up/down volume ratio shows positive demand over the last 50 days.

The drug stock holds a respectable 90 Relative Strength Rating whereas Novo Nordisk has been a true laggard with its 14 RS Rating.

Lilly Profit Expected To Rise

Eli Lilly reported a blockbuster quarter in September with nearly 500% profit growth and 54% sales growth.

Lilly's profit took off in 2024 and more than doubled to $12.99 per share after dropping 20% in 2023. Full-year 2025 estimates expect 83% growth to $23.77 per share, followed by a 37% jump to $32.50 per share in 2026.

Its revenue growth averaged around 45% over the last four quarters. But forecasts see growth slowing to the 32% to 34% range over the next two quarters.

Lastly, Lilly stock holds an ideal 99 Composite Rating and a 98 Earnings Per Share Rating.

Here are some of the laws and policies that will take effect in 2026—many of which continue to push forward on important issues for workers despite what the federal government has in store.

Anti-DEI measures

Trump has made anti-DEI policies a focal point of his time in office, kicking off this year with a number of executive orders that forced federal agencies to terminate all DEI-related policies and programs and stripped away a requirement for federal contractors that had been a crucial element of diversifying the workforce. That means, going into 2026, all federal DEI programs have been eliminated—but there are a number of state-level bills that seek to curtail how DEI is utilized in hiring and across public education.

In Ohio, for example, legislation that passed this year prohibits any consideration of DEI in hiring decisions at public colleges and universities. Similar laws in Kansas, Idaho, and Wyoming will curtail DEI programs for hiring across higher education.

Meanwhile, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—the agency tasked with enforcing antidiscrimination laws in employment—has made clear that corporate DEI programs will be under greater scrutiny going into 2026.

The use of AI in hiring

As companies have embedded AI into their hiring process, many HR teams have started relying on automated résumé screeners and other AI tools. In 2026, three laws will take effect at the state level to create some guardrails around how AI is being used for employment decisions, following in the footsteps of New York City and California, which have already adopted AI in hiring laws.

Colorado and Texas are introducing broader AI governance laws that also explicitly call for more oversight of how the technology is used in the hiring process to ensure it is not discriminatory. In Illinois, the law is an amendment of the state’s Human Rights Act and regulates how workers are impacted by the use of AI in all employment decisions. At the federal level, a bipartisan bill introduced in Congress last month would—if passed—force employers to disclose when layoffs are caused by AI.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-191464809-these-laws-will-change-how-you-work-in-2026.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 14:16:05.252416

EC: Showroomprivé is a consolidated, listed group, so I’m not going to comment on the figures.
And as we’ve grown, we’ve reworked customer service and logistics… We’ve raised our game.","The Bradery has returned to independence. After three years within the Showroomprivé group, the private-sales platform for premium brands and experiences has been reacquired in full by its founders, Edouard Caraco and Timothée Linyer. On December 22, Showroomprivé announced it had sold its 52.75% stake in the company for €19 million, a deal accompanied by additional terms and performance-related earn-outs for the Parisian gem. This brings fresh performance pressure for The Bradery. Edouard Caraco shares with the background to this takeover, his vision for the company’s development- underpinned by the app’s performance- and the founding duo’s plans in the luxury sector.

FashionNetwork.com: Showroomprivé has officially confirmed that it has sold its majority stake in The Bradery to you. When did you start negotiating this takeover, given that the group's initial plan was to acquire 100% of the capital? What were the main points of discussion, given the group's financial challenges?

Edouard Caraco: The takeover stemmed from several factors. For me, the key was that Tim (co-founder Timothée Linyer) and I were convinced of the market’s potential. We spent a great deal of time over the past year preparing the project, and that really drove the discussions. We felt as though we were letting go of our baby, even though we were only at the beginning of what we were capable of achieving. Reacquiring The Bradery is about taking a long-term view. I think that when we ceded the majority stake, we were also less mature. We were in a rush about everything. I still like to move fast, but I now see that continuity is a very positive virtue in an economic environment that can be unstable. That’s what we offer our partner brands, our customers, and our team.

FNW: Yes, but why did you give up the majority stake when Showroomprivé came in?

EC: When Showroomprivé came in, it was the end of the Covid period. We had experienced a very strong surge after our launch, and we didn’t really know whether we had been propelled by the online consumption boom of that period or whether we had the opportunity to build a longer-term business. And, as I said, we were young and in a hurry. Since then, the company has continued to grow strongly. Tim and I have been friends since we were 10. We feel incredibly fortunate to have a company that performs, that’s growing, with an amazing team, and where we both enjoy coming to work every day.

FNW: How are you financing this share buyback? It's a substantial sum, so did you bring in new partners?

EC: We wanted to take back 100% of the company. We had no desire to change shareholders, either now or in the medium term. For us, the deal was clear: either we regained 100% of the capital by financing the acquisition with debt, or we saw through the initial agreement and sold 100% of our shares. Our banks supported us- they were brilliant on the project- so it was possible.

FNW: The agreement also includes a vendor loan of three million euros. Between your repayments and the commitments to the Showroomprivé group, doesn't this put a lot of pressure on the company's profitability over the next few years?

EC: The Bradery is a fast-growing company. And of course we must maintain the level of profitability that stems from the teams’ work. But we based our plan on the level we have today.

FNW: In your results filed for 2024, you mention a net profit of over €4 million on turnover of €62 million. What are your 2025 results?

EC: Showroomprivé is a consolidated, listed group, so I’m not going to comment on the figures. What I can say is that we recorded strong double-digit growth in 2025. And if we maintain our profitability for 10 years, we’ll have no problem repaying the debt.

FNW: That's the financial part. But leaving a group also implies adjustments. What reorganisation and process changes are you going to have to implement?

EC: This was really the point that prompted us to pursue the buyback. We have kept our team- even as we grew from 40 to 70 people- our model, our premises and our processes. And Tim and I have remained very hands-on at The Bradery. I look after sales and Tim handles marketing. We knew there would be no friction. And honestly, if it had taken six months to transform the company, I don’t think we would have wanted to go for it. I believe this also influenced Showroomprivé’s management in their decision. In our absence, it would have required a significant implementation effort. We use for our CMS and we hadn’t migrated to Showroomprivé’s internal processes. The only area where we benefited from their clout was logistics. But we have strong relationships with our carriers.

An app at the heart of the model

FNW: Since 2022, you've significantly increased the number of The Bradery's operations and opened new verticals such as travel- as Showroomprivé also did.

EC: We have grown very independently. Historically, The Bradery is a private-sales player in premium ready-to-wear. But today we’ve built an offering that very much meets the expectations of the audience we want to appeal to: young women aged 25–35 who are looking for premium offers. She wants to find fashion on the platform, but she also wants experiences. That’s why we’ve developed offers for gyms, travel, and concerts. We want to become the shopping destination for this generation. In this respect, we have developed our own processes. What Showroomprivé clearly gave us is ambition. They taught us to plan ahead. We’re much smaller, more niche and more selective in our offering.

FNW: What growth drivers are you considering?

EC: We have several important priorities. Internationalising the business is one of them. We only generate 5% of our sales from exports, concentrated in the Benelux countries and Spain- and mainly in Belgium. So we need to develop a real strategy for our presence in neighbouring countries. We’re going to organise ourselves to reach the Benelux countries, Spain, and Italy. This means proposing an offer that appeals to local customers, with a relevant offer for each country. If you think you’ll succeed just by translating the site, you’re deluding yourself. Entrepreneurial success is about the people you manage to bring together.

FNW: You've diversified your offering, but what share does fashion still represent?

EC: It’s not the fastest-growing vertical; we’ve seen particularly strong growth in beauty and home. But it remains the largest part of our business.

FNW: And how have you maintained its attractiveness as you’ve expanded your offer, given that initially exclusivity also came from a limited number of operations?

EC: It’s a topic we’ve worked on extensively to improve the customer experience. To that end, we’ve moved from an online strategy to an app-first strategy. Of course, we still have a website, with a new version going live in the first half of this year. But we’ve invested heavily in the app, with the aim of building daily habits for our customers. They log on every morning to discover the latest offers. And we now generate 70% of our sales via the app.

FNW: Successful app launches are rare. What's your formula?

EC: The data show that customers using the app are more engaged than site visitors. They come back more often and purchase more frequently. We’ve hired specialists to improve the experience and encourage repeat visits by personalising the journey as much as possible and making the purchasing process as easy as possible. Buying via the app is as simple as ordering an Uber. And as we’ve grown, we’ve reworked customer service and logistics… We’ve raised our game.

FNW: And how do you manage to generate profitable growth at a time when consumer spending is struggling and digital performance has been more challenging in recent seasons?

EC: Across all operations, we work with brands, but we take a prudent, common-sense approach to generating profitability. We’re still very modest in size and very humble about the global context. I look at what Veepee and Showroomprivé have achieved with a lot of admiration, and I hope we’ll be their size one day. Simply maintaining their level of activity at such scale already seems a success to me. Beyond that, I believe that, in the current context, our size gives us the agility to be responsive and opportunistic, and to set up operations very quickly- with brands- in 48–72 hours. I see that as a competitive advantage. Incidentally, another growth lever for The Bradery is physical sales.

FNW: Why, when your expertise is online?

EC: We started in December and it worked very well. We’ve worked with Maison , Levi’s, Drôle de Monsieur… I think a lot of brands understand that digital and physical complement each other. And there’s a shift back to physical retail, particularly among customers looking for premium offers. Our customers expect it. But it’s also important to remember that we’re obsessed with profitability. We’re always balancing the provision of solutions for partners with keeping the books in order. So for physical operations, we’re taking a pop-up approach to control our investments. And we’re going to continue like this in 2026, managing it on a variable-cost basis, with two to three operations per month.

LAS VEGAS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to give a speech ​on Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in ‌Las Vegas, potentially revealing new details about product plans for the world's ‌most valuable listed company as it faces increasing competition from both rivals and its own customers.

Prediction Market powered by

Less than two weeks ago, the company scooped up talent and chip technology from startup ⁠Groq, including executives who ‌were instrumental in helping Alphabet's Google design its own AI chips. While Google is a ‍major Nvidia customer, its own chips have emerged as one of Nvidia's biggest threats as Google works closely with Meta Platforms and ​others to chip away at Nvidia's AI stronghold.

At the ‌same time, Nvidia is eager to show that its latest products can outperform older chips like the H200, which U.S. President Donald Trump has allowed to flow to China. Reuters has reported that the chip, which was the predecessor ⁠to Nvidia's current flagship ""Blackwell"" chip, is ​in high demand in China, ​which has alarmed China hawks across the U.S. political spectrum.

Huang's speech is scheduled to begin at 4 ‍p.m. EST (2100 ⁠GMT). Other key speakers at the annual trade show this year include AMD CEO Lisa Su, the CEO ⁠of Finnish health tech company Oura, Tom Hale, and PC maker Lenovo's ‌CEO, Yuanqing Yang.

We may have rested for the festive period but the world of technology did not. Here are five big stories you might have missed while we were away.

1. Meta buys Manus

Manus is a China-based agentic AI company which hailed an arranged marriage to Meta Platforms as “validation of our pioneering work” on general iterations of the technology.

Meta Platforms stated Manus launched its first general AI agent during 2025, and had served more than 147 trillion tokens and created in excess of 80 million virtual computers by the time of its announcement on 29 December.

The AI company is set to bolster Meta Platforms broader AI efforts targeting consumer and business segments.

Financial Times reported the company was once considered to be the “next DeepSeek”, but noted there could be opposition to the takeover among regulators in the US and China.

2. SoftBank Group ups OpenAI investment

The Japanese giant declared it had “fully satisfied its commitment to invest in OpenAI” after completing an additional outlay of $22.5 billion through its SoftBank Vision Fund 2 on 26 December.

SoftBank’s holding in OpenAI was taken to 11 per cent.

It pumped $7.5 billion into the US company and raised $11 billion from third-party investors earlier in 2025.

The Japanese company’s chair and CEO Masayoshi Son said it is “deeply aligned” with OpenAI’s broader ambitions for the technology and the latter’s chief Sam Altman highlighted time-to-market benefits from the tie-up.

3. SKT gives AI hyperscale

South Korean operator SK Telecom (SKT) unveiled an AI model it believes will prove foundational to the nation’s goals for the technology.

The A.Z K1 model “marks the beginning of a full-stack AI ecosystem, encompassing all areas from semiconductors to services”, SKT stated.

A.Z K1 features 519 billion parameters and is a bump to Korean ambitions to rival the US and China in AI technology leadership.

The model feeds information to smaller versions with a particular focus on those with less than 70 billion parameters. SKT intends to provide A.X K1 through its A-dot set-up, among other methods, giving it a potential market of 10 million users from the off.

SKT believes the model will also positively impact South Korea’s semiconductor sector by boosting verification of memory bandwidth and inter-GPU communication speed.

4. RAM costs rocket

Various news outlets predicted a tough 2026 for consumer electronics, in particular PCs and smartphones due to a shortage in RAM.

BBC News reported RAM demand is being driven by the requirements of AI data centres, noting the memory type is as important an element as processors which typically dominate headlines relating to the sites.

Experts told the news outlet higher memory costs would likely be passed on to consumers, speculating this could in turn impact demand for new smartphones and PCs.

The reports were sparked by an IDC analysis in mid-December 2025 in which it warned the situation could go beyond “a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand”.

5. Apple cuts Vision Pro production

IDC figures also feature in reports Apple cut production of its Vision Pro headset, which the analyst company separately noted struggled to gain traction in terms of shipments during 2025.

Financial Times reported changes in the output from Vision Pro manufacturer Luxshare and highlighted a shift in Apple’s marketing spending, each pitched as a sign the company is falling short in terms of wooing consumers.

The IDC figures referenced offered a gloomy outlook for mixed and virtual reality headsets as a whole, with the company predicting shipments in 2025 would be down 42.8 per cent year-on-year but are likely to pick up again this year.",https://assets.mobileworldlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/06105007/Newspaper_train_SS_generic.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 13:01:27.868822

The conference, hosted by the Consumer Technology Association, takes place from Jan. 5 to Jan. 9 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas.

We will keep you posted on all the retail action on the ground, but here is a preview of what the CES retail programing will cover.

A panel on agentic AI focused on AI agents in the real world is just one of the event’s many Monday offerings. Chandhu Nair, SVP of data, artificial intelligence, and innovation at Lowe’s, will give the audience a home improvement retailer’s perspective on the topic.

On Tuesday, technology’s big show will have a session with Best Buy CEO Corie Barry, who will talk about getting people, software, and services to actually work together instead of fighting against each other.

Last year, Best Buy underwent a rebrand with a holographic mascot and a new tagline—“Imagine that”—as the retailer positions itself to become consumers’ go-to source for technology items. In August 2025, Best Buy also introduced its third-party marketplace to build additional income streams through wider product assortment and advertising.

That same day, beauty and fashion industry experts, including Oscar de la Renta CMO Chloe Popescu and Kimberly Villatoro, CEO of Patrick Ta Beauty, will be on a panel to discuss how social platforms are merging content and community to create immersive, shoppable experiences.

On Wednesday, Kroger will host a panel called “Irrational consumers: how to grow brands in an unreasonable world.” The session will decode how brands can understand why shoppers make weird decisions and use that insight to grow in 2026.

A panel called “The future of ‘search’ at retail” on Thursday will delve into how AI agents transform traditional retail search based on people’s preferences, budget, and style? Attendees will hear from Justin Honaman, global head of worldwide retail, restaurants, and consumer goods at Amazon, and Egan Brinkman, managing director of commerce at Google, along with executives from Microsoft and Pinterest.

Another notable session on Thursday called “The new retail experience in the AI-powered store” will feature executives from Tractor Supply Company—the Brentwood, Tennessee-based farm products and home improvement retailer—and big box retailer Target that takes attendees behind the scenes to show how everything from inventory and logistics to checkout and service are changing thanks to AI.

Parallel retail tracks on topics of fashion tech, beauty tech, and AI programming will run simultaneously during the week.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/fdb78780be09490d03044195df9107702827e8fd-7960x5307.jpg?rect=0,564,7960,4179&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-05 15:01:34.672523

See our latest analysis for Uber Technologies.

That downgrade lands after a tougher few months for the stock, with a 30 day share price return of 9.26% decline and a 90 day share price return of 15.28% decline, even though the 1 year total shareholder return of 24.96% and 3 year total shareholder return of about 3x still point to strong longer run momentum that is now being questioned as robotaxis, tax changes in the UK and potential deals like SpotHero reshape how investors think about Uber’s risk profile.

If this kind of shake up has you reassessing your options, it could be a good time to scan other high growth tech and AI stocks that might benefit or compete as autonomous tech rolls out.

With a recent 30-day return of a 9.26% decline and a 90-day return of a 15.28% decline, yet a 1-year total return near 25% and about 3x over three years, is Uber now attractively priced, or is the market already reflecting expectations for future growth in the share price?

Most Popular Narrative: 26.1% Undervalued

Uber Technologies' most followed narrative pegs fair value at about US$112 per share compared with the last close at US$82.86, setting up a meaningful debate on what the market is pricing in.

Significant investments and accelerating partnerships in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and electrification (with Waymo, Lucid, Nuro, etc.) position Uber to benefit from secular industry shifts. Successful AV commercialization could transform long-term cost structures and profitability, boosting future earnings potential. Progressive scaling of high-margin ancillary revenue streams such as advertising, data/tech platform externalization, and Uber One loyalty are supporting margin expansion and enhancing long-term earning power.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what earnings path and margin mix get Uber from today’s profitability to that higher fair value? The projections rely on specific revenue growth, margin reset and future P/E assumptions that you can only see laid out in full inside the narrative.

Result: Fair Value of $112.06 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, there is still a real chance that heavy spending on autonomous partnerships and tougher competition across ride hailing and AV could pressure margins and weaken the thesis.

There is plenty to be excited about in HP’s latest announcements, led by the new HP OmniBook Ultra 14. The company describes it as the world’s slimmest consumer notebook to offer high-end AI performance, and the specifications support that positioning. Buyers can choose between an HP-exclusive Snapdragon X2 Elite processor, capable of delivering up to 85 trillion operations per second for running multiple AI applications simultaneously, or next-generation Intel Core Ultra processors aimed at more graphics-intensive workloads.

Despite everything HP has packed into the new OmniBook Ultra 14, the laptop remains highly portable. It is 52 per cent lighter than its predecessor and five per cent thinner than the 2025 Apple MacBook Air 13 with the M4 chip, while still featuring a vivid 3K OLED display. The device also includes a posture-detection feature designed to prompt users if they begin slouching or holding their neck at an uncomfortable angle.

For users who prefer a stationary workstation, the HP OmniStudio X 27 all-in-one offers a compelling alternative. The company says it is the world’s first Neo LED all-in-one PC with dual 100 per cent colour coverage, positioning it as a strong option for designers and content creators. Internally, the system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and can be configured with an optional NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 GPU.

HP is also pushing innovation with Thunderbolt Share, a new feature that allows users to connect a laptop directly to an all-in-one PC. The setup lets users control both devices with a single keyboard and mouse, or share the all-in-one’s high-quality webcam. It also introduces Surface View, a camera feature that allows the lens to tilt downward so users can share sketches or notes on their desk during video calls.

The broader update touches nearly every corner of HP’s consumer lineup. The OmniBook family now includes the X, 7, 5 and 3 series, each aimed at different needs and budgets. Notably, the OmniBook 3 16, powered by Snapdragon X, is claimed to deliver up to 45 hours of battery life, setting a new benchmark for endurance in consumer AI PCs, and something we at CGMagazine will need to test for ourselves.

Rounding out the announcements is the updated HP Chromebook Plus x360 14, which combines a rugged, drop-tested design with a 360-degree hinge and Google’s latest artificial intelligence tools. From the looks of things, it is a solid entry, especially for people who want to avoid the complexities of Windows or macOS, in favour of a more streamlined overall experience.

With these releases, HP is presenting a clear view of where it sees consumer computing heading, toward smarter and more adaptable hardware designed to support modern digital lifestyles. Early impressions suggest there is much to be interested in across the new lineup.",https://cdn.cgmagonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ces-2026-hp-refreshes-its-pc-lineup-with-snapdragon-power-and-serious-ai-ambitions-2025-12-28-255586.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:01:02.710432

The core issue is a worldwide memory shortage. Large AI data centers are buying massive amounts of memory chips, which leave fewer parts available for consumer products like gaming graphics cards. As a result, supply has weakened just as demand remains strong.

In Germany, a major PC parts retailer said its distributor has limited orders of the RTX 5070 to five units at a time, while stopping deliveries of higher models such as the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090. Similarly, a leading Japanese electronics retailer in Tokyo has begun limiting customers to one high-memory graphics card per purchase, while also warning that future deliveries are uncertain.

Meanwhile, NVDA shares rose 1.26% on Friday, closing at $188.85.

AI Demand Reshapes the GPU Market

The memory shortage is changing how graphics cards are built and priced. According to industry research firm TrendForce, memory now makes up more than 80% of a GPU’s total cost. This share has risen sharply as prices for advanced memory types have increased by several hundred percent in recent months.

Major suppliers such as SK Hynix have shifted focus away from consumer memory toward high-margin memory used in AI accelerators. Internal company forecasts suggest tight supply for consumer memory could last until at least 2028, which limits how quickly the gaming market can recover.

As a result, both Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to raise graphics card prices in stages starting in early 2026. Reports indicate that AMD has already begun modest increases, while Nvidia may follow soon after. Over time, repeated price hikes could push top-tier cards well above their original launch prices.

Production Cuts and Price Hikes

In addition, Nvidia is reportedly planning to reduce gaming GPU production by 30% to 40% in the first half of 2026 compared with last year. Models that use large amounts of memory are expected to see the biggest cuts, as memory supply remains the main constraint.

Meanwhile, Nvidia has informed partners that it plans to restart production of the RTX 3060, a graphics card first released in 2021. This older model uses a different type of memory that is more available today, which may help Nvidia keep a presence in the lower-priced gaming market while shortages continue.

Overall, the situation highlights how rising AI demand is reshaping the balance between data center and consumer hardware, with lasting effects on pricing, supply, and profit focus across the semiconductor industry.

Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

On the Street, Nvidia holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target is $262.79, implying a 39.15% upside from the current price.

In its December 23 announcement, CMS invited interested manufacturers to apply to opt into the BALANCE Model by responding to the Request for Applications (RFA) by January 8, 2026.
Under the BALANCE Model, CMS will negotiate directly with GLP-1 manufacturers to reduce net prices, cap out-of-pocket costs, and standardize coverage criteria.
The BALANCE Model will also be open to all states participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP).
Beyond BALANCE: Two Other CMS Proposed Models for Part B and Part D Drugs In addition to the BALANCE Model, CMS has introduced several other pricing initiatives that align with the Trump administration’s MFN drug pricing strategies, also aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs.","On December 23, 2025, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the Better Approaches to Lifestyles and Nutrition for Comprehensive hEalth (BALANCE) Model, a voluntary, alternative payment model (APM), designed to expand access to GLP-1 medications. At its core, the BALANCE Model intends to promote the use of both GLP-1 medications and lifestyle interventions to help prevent chronic conditions and combat obesity, while also managing the costs of such medications for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and taxpayers.

Framework of the BALANCE Model

Similar to the recent Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing deals with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which expanded GLP-1 coverage for Medicare beneficiaries at a discounted monthly rate, the BALANCE Model builds on the Trump administration’s broader strategy to lower drug costs through direct manufacturer negotiations. However, the BALANCE Model takes the MFN pricing approach a step further by also expanding the use of lifestyle-focused preventative care initiatives.

In its December 23 announcement, CMS invited interested manufacturers to apply to opt into the BALANCE Model by responding to the Request for Applications (RFA) by January 8, 2026. States and Part D plan sponsors were also asked to submit a Notice of Intent to participate by the same date. Under the BALANCE Model, CMS will negotiate directly with GLP-1 manufacturers to reduce net prices, cap out-of-pocket costs, and standardize coverage criteria. CMS is also seeking commitments for manufacturer-provided lifestyle support services, such as fitness coaching and nutrition counseling, to supplement GLP-1 treatments and maintain long-term health.

The BALANCE Model will waive the current Part D coverage exclusion for weight-loss medications, meaning GLP-1s will be included in the basic benefit with set cost-sharing limits, aiming to increase accessibility and affordability. Participating plans will cover the negotiated drugs from participating manufacturers, and the manufacturers will provide rebates to keep prices aligned with negotiated terms. This structure integrates coverage, pricing, and access, targeting preventive care goals.

The BALANCE Model will also be open to all states participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). States that wish to participate were also asked to respond to the State RFA by January 8, 2026. Under State Medicaid coverage, price reductions will occur through supplemental rebate agreements between state agencies and manufacturers.

Action Plan and Timeline

The Model is set to launch in Medicaid programs as early as May 2026, and in Medicare Part D plans in January 2027. In the interim, CMS plans to implement a Medicare GLP-1 payment demonstration in July 2026. This demonstration will allow beneficiaries to obtain access to GLP-1 medications for $50 per month, so long as they meet the negotiated access criteria.

Beyond BALANCE: Two Other CMS Proposed Models for Part B and Part D Drugs

In addition to the BALANCE Model, CMS has introduced several other pricing initiatives that align with the Trump administration’s MFN drug pricing strategies, also aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs. We discuss these proposed models in our recently published blog post, CMS Targets Rising Drug Costs with New GUARD and GLOBE Pilot Programs.",https://www.mintz.com/sites/default/files/media/images/2020-02-14/Health-Care_Small_Viewpoints.png,N,,2026-01-05 14:16:10.683018

What's in the News

A U.S. appeals court temporarily paused a government order that would have required Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico to unwind their joint venture by January 1, putting on hold an action aimed at their coordination on scheduling, pricing, and capacity for U.S. Mexico routes.

Delta and Aeromexico have filed a legal challenge in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Transportation Department order to dissolve their joint venture, seeking to maintain their current level of cooperation on cross border flights.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said the 6% air traffic cut tied to the recent government shutdown will end at 6 a.m. on Monday, although airlines including Delta have indicated it may still take several days for flight operations to return to more typical levels.

FAA related staffing shortages have recently led to flight delays and cancellations across major U.S. airports, affecting multiple carriers including Delta as the agency operated with reduced air traffic control capacity.

Delta Air Lines issued guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2025, indicating an expected total revenue year over year change for Q4 of up 2% to 4%, Q4 earnings per share in a range of US$1.60 to US$1.90, and full year 2025 earnings per share of about US$6.

How This Changes the Fair Value For Delta Air Lines

Fair Value Estimate: Adjusted slightly higher from US$73.64 to US$74.61, reflecting modestly updated modelling assumptions.

Discount Rate: Tweaked marginally lower from 9.19% to 9.18%, indicating a very small change in the required return used in the analysis.

Revenue Growth: Assumed long term growth rate moved slightly from 3.77% to 3.92%.

Net Profit Margin: Adjusted marginally from 7.16% to 7.14%, suggesting only a very small change in expected profitability levels.

Future P/E: Target future P/E multiple edged higher from 12.76x to 12.90x, a modest shift in how earnings are being valued in the model.

What Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock?","Gear up for Jan. 5 because today’s the day Wall Street and AI enthusiasts alike are eyeing as a potential catalyst event for Nvidia’s (NVDA) next chapter. After an explosive run that briefly made Nvidia the first company in the world to surpass a $5 trillion market cap, driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips and datacenter hardware, the tech giant kicks off 2026 with a high-profile platform to shape the coming year’s narrative.

That’s when CEO Jensen Huang is expected to deliver an address at CES 2026, a stage where Nvidia has historically outlined strategic technology roadmaps and unveiled innovations that influence investor sentiment and industry direction. With demand for its advanced AI accelerators, geopolitical trade dynamics, and potentially lifting chip stocks, Jan. 5 could set the tone for Nvidia’s performance and investor expectations for the year ahead.

Wedbush analysts expect Jensen Huang to use his speech to lay out the company’s next-phase AI strategy, highlighting surging enterprise adoption as the AI revolution enters a new growth stage. The focus is likely to center on data centers, physical AI, robotics, and autonomous technologies, with updates on Nvidia’s Cosmos foundation model platform. Beyond AI infrastructure, Nvidia is also expected to unveil new developments across gaming, content creation and simulation.

About Nvidia Stock

Nvidia Corporation is a global leader in accelerated computing and AI, renowned for pioneering the graphics processing unit (GPU) that revolutionized gaming, data centers, and AI-driven computing. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Nvidia’s technology now powers everything from high-performance gaming and cloud computing to autonomous vehicles and generative AI applications. With a market cap of roughly $4.6 trillion, Nvidia stands among the world’s most valuable companies, driven by its dominance in AI infrastructure and continued innovation in next-generation chip design.

In 2025, Nvidia’s share price experienced a noteworthy but volatile year. After opening the year significantly lower, the stock rallied on sustained demand for its AI hardware and datacenter solutions, driven by its leadership in the generative AI boom.

The 52-week low was around $86.62, reached in April 2025, while the 52-week high reached around $212.19, achieved in late October as the company hit record valuation milestones and investor optimism peaked.

That wide gulf between the high and low underscores how sentiment shifted throughout the year as Nvidia navigated geopolitical concerns, macroeconomic headwinds, and equally powerful AI demand tailwinds. The stock has overall delivered 31.6% returns over the past year.

Nvidia’s dominant position has led it to trade at a pronounced premium valuation compared to its industry peers, at 42.35 times forward earnings.

Strong Q3 Performance

Nvidia delivered a particularly strong showing in its third quarter of fiscal 2026 results that underscore just how deep the demand for AI infrastructure has become. On Nov. 19, the company reported revenue of a record $57 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 26, representing a 62% year-over-year (YOY) jump and a 22% increase from the prior quarter.

The company’s datacenter business was the main engine, with datacenter revenue hitting $51.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago, reflecting surging demand for AI-ready GPUs and cloud computing infrastructure. The firm’s profitability remained strong, with non-GAAP gross margins holding around 73.6% and the non-GAAP EPS at $1.30, a 60% YOY rise and comfortably ahead of Wall Street estimates.

Management also offered bullish forward guidance, expecting around $65 billion, plus or minus 2% in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026. That projection suggests confidence in continued strong demand for its AI chips and datacenter gear despite macroeconomic headwinds or geopolitical uncertainty.

Analysts tracking Nvidia project the company’s EPS to climb 51.2% YoY to $4.43 in fiscal 2026 and grow another 56.7% to $6.94 in fiscal 2027.

What Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock?

Several Wall Street analysts have recently reaffirmed positive ratings on Nvidia stock in the wake of its strategic deal with AI chipmaker Groq, signaling continued confidence in the company’s growth prospects. Following the announcement of the approximately $20 billion non-exclusive licensing agreement and talent acquisition from Groq, analysts are showing renewed optimism.

Among others, Mizuho reiterated its “Outperform” rating and $245 price target on Nvidia following its deal with Groq, reinforcing bullish analyst sentiment. Mizuho views the transaction as a long-term positive that enhances Nvidia’s inferencing capabilities and supports its strong growth trajectory.

Also, Bernstein SocGen reiterated an “Outperform” rating and a $275 price target on Nvidia after its Groq technology deal.

Wall Street’s bullishness is evident in Nvidia having a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 advise a “Strong Buy,” two suggest a “Moderate Buy,” one analyst is on the sidelines, giving it a “Hold” rating, and one offers a “Strong Sell” rating.

The average analyst price target for NVDA is $256, indicating a potential upside of 35.6%. Also, the Street-high target price of $352 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 86.4%.",https://media.barchart.com/contributors-admin/common-images/images/S%26P%20500%20Companies/Technology%20(names%20J%20-%20Z)/NVIDIA%20Corp%20logo%20on%20phone%20and%20AI%20chip-by%20Below%20the%20Sky%20via%20Shutterstock.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:01:19.588137

Citi has a $135 price target on the stock.","CoreWeave shares were rising early Monday after a known critic of the company upgraded the stock and raised its price target, citing an OpenAI fundraise would also benefit the cloud-tech company.

DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria upgraded CoreWeave to Neutral from Underperform and raised his price target to $68 from $36, triggering a rise of more than 4% in the stock.

The move drew attention partly because CoreWeave was already trading well above that level, changing hands at $79.32.

Upgrade driven by OpenAI funding prospects

Luria said his reassessment was linked to reports that OpenAI could pursue a fundraising round of up to $100 billion, a deal that, if completed, would improve visibility around CoreWeave’s large contracts with the AI developer.

“It shouldn’t be a foregone conclusion that OpenAI successfully completes its reported $100 billion potential fundraise, but if it does so, it would be able to fulfill all its commitments in 2026, including to CoreWeave,” Luria said in a note to clients.

CoreWeave signed a five-year contract worth $11.9 billion with OpenAI in March 2025 to provide cloud computing services, a deal that has been central to investor expectations for future revenue growth.

Despite the upgrade, Luria stressed that his fundamental concerns about the business had not disappeared.

He said that while a successful OpenAI fundraise could delay pressure on CoreWeave, it would not resolve deeper structural issues.

“While this would not change the value destruction inherent in CRWV’s business, it would kick the can down the road for the inevitable reckoning,” he said.

Debt concerns remain front and centre

Luria has been one of the most outspoken critics of CoreWeave, arguing that its model of taking on significant debt to build AI infrastructure for clients such as Microsoft and Nvidia is unsustainable.

He reiterated that view on Monday, warning that equity investors could still face heavy losses.

“We continue to believe that the equity in shares of CRWV may ultimately lose all its value since the entire value of the enterprise is owned by debt holders,” he said.

The analyst added that there was still a risk that a large portion of CoreWeave’s backlog may not be realised.

If OpenAI’s fundraising effort falls well short of the reported $100 billion target by the end of March, he warned, there could be “an acceleration of the collapse in the value of CRWV shares”.

Luria has previously said CoreWeave appears to be generating a return on capital of about 4%, well below an estimated cost of capital of 9%.

Broader analyst views

CoreWeave has countered such criticism by saying its contracts are designed to deliver risk-adjusted returns above its cost of capital and typically include fixed payments regardless of utilisation.

Other analysts expect margins to improve and borrowing costs to fall over time.

According to LSEG-compiled data, 17 of the 32 brokerages covering the stock rate it a buy or higher, while 13 recommend hold and two advise selling.

The median price target stands at $125.38.

The company went public in March in one of the most closely watched technology listings of the year, but its shares have been volatile as investors debate whether enthusiasm around artificial intelligence is becoming overheated.

Sentiment improved last month after CoreWeave was named as one of 24 partners in the US Department of Energy’s Genesis Mission, which aims to use AI to accelerate scientific discovery.

The stock also benefited from a bullish note last month by Citi Research analyst Tyler Radke, who resumed coverage after a restricted period.

Radke said management commentary suggested capacity expansion and bookings momentum were continuing into the fourth quarter, setting the stage for faster growth in 2026, even as the company works through supply constraints and power-related delays.

LAS VEGAS, 5 janvier 2026 – Cette année au CES 2026, L'Oréal Groupe, leader mondial de la beauté, a présenté deux technologies révolutionnaires qui exploitent la puissance de la lumière pour transformer les soins capillaires et cutanés : Light Straight + Multi-styler et LED Face Mask, toutes deux lauréates d’un CES 2026 Innovation Award.

« Chez L'Oréal, nous croyons depuis toujours que la beauté est profondément liée à la découverte scientifique, une conviction qui est au cœur de notre Groupe depuis plus de 115 ans. Aujourd’hui, c’est la combinatoire de nos avancées scientifiques et technologiques et de notre créativité qui nous permet de concevoir des expériences de beauté uniques, plus performantes et mieux adaptées aux besoins de chacune et chacun. Cette année, au CES 2026, notre connaissance scientifique et le développement de technologies LED propriétaires sur le marché illustrent une nouvelle fois notre engagement à repousser les limites des nouvelles solutions beauté », a déclaré Barbara Lavernos, Directrice Générale Adjointe en charge de la Recherche, de l'Innovation et de la Technologie chez L'Oréal Groupe.

L’Oréal présente Light Straight + Multi-styler

Depuis plus d’un siècle, le fer à lisser fait partie des accessoires incontournables de coiffage. Pourtant, les plaques chauffantes traditionnelles peuvent monter à 205 °C, dépassant largement le seuil à partir duquel la kératine commence à se dénaturer ayant pour conséquences de fragiliser la cuticule, d’augmenter la casse et d’atténuer la brillance des cheveux. C’est d’ailleurs une préoccupation majeure chez les consommateurs : selon une étude menée par L’Oréal auprès de consommatrices américaines en 2024, 58% des femmes interrogées déclarent que la chaleur est à l’origine de leurs cheveux abîmés.

Développé par la Recherche & l’Innovation de L'Oréal, Light Straight + Multi-styler utilise une technologie de lumière infrarouge* brevetée qui offre des résultats de coiffage exceptionnels tout en protégeant la santé des cheveux. Light Straight + Multi-styler est équipé de plaques en verre qui lissent efficacement les cheveux, sans jamais dépasser 160°C – soit une réduction significative de la température par rapport à la plupart des fers à lisser traditionnels. Selon des tests instrumentaux menés par L'Oréal, Light Straight + Multi-styler agit 3 fois plus vite et rend les cheveux 2 fois plus lisses que les lisseurs les plus hauts de gamme.

L'expérience utilisateur de Light Straight + Multi-styler repose sur une science et une ingénierie de haute précision. L'appareil utilise la lumière proche infrarouge, située juste au-delà du spectre visible, qui pénètre au cœur de la fibre capillaire. Cette solution remodèle les structures moléculaires qui déterminent la forme et la texture des cheveux tout en préservant leur intégrité et leur santé.

« Light Straight + Multi-styler fait passer le coiffage de la correction à la prévention. En limitant l’exposition répétée à la chaleur, nous contribuons à préserver l’intégrité du cheveu naturel dès le départ et permettons aux consommateurs de protéger leurs cheveux dans la durée. Nous pensons que cette innovation établit un nouveau standard en matière de coiffage de précision, non seulement en améliorant, mais en redéfinissant toute la catégorie du coiffage », a déclaré Guive Balooch, Vice-Président du Métier Beauté Augmentée et de l’Open Innovation chez L'Oréal et membre du Conseil des Leaders de l'Industrie de la Consumer Technology Association (CTA).

Parmi les avantages clés de Light Straight + Multi-styler :

Technologie infrarouge brevetée*: le design exclusif de l’appareil offre un rendu ultra-lisse et une meilleure tenue dans le temps.

Polyvalence multi-coiffure : en plus de lisser et d'adoucir les cheveux, Light Straight + Multi-styler peut être utilisé pour boucler les cheveux avec soin et précision, offrant une solution de coiffage multi-usage.

Résultats personnalisés : avec ses capteurs internes intelligents, ses algorithmes propriétaires intégrés et son apprentissage automatique, l'appareil s'adapte aux gestes de l'utilisateur pour optimiser l'expérience de chacun.

Avec AirLight Pro dévoilé au CES 2024, et dorénavant Light Straight + Multi-styler, L'Oréal déploie sa technologie de lumière infrarouge pour une routine de coiffage complète qui protège les cheveux.

Light Straight + Multi-styler devrait être lancé mondialement en 2027. Plus de détails, y compris les prix, seront disponibles sur loreal.com.

L'Oréal annonce le développement de LED Face Mask pour des soins ciblés de la peau

Poursuivant son engagement en matière d'innovations technologiques et de science de la longévité au service de la beauté, L’Oréal a également dévoilé son LED Face Mask, lauréat d'un CES 2026 Innovation Award. Développé avec I-Smart Developments, leader mondial de l'innovation en matière de dispositifs LED, ce masque flexible en silicone transparent et ultrafin – actuellement sous forme de prototype – diffuse la lumière directement sur le visage pour agir sur les signes de l’âge. Ce dispositif innovant intègre un microcircuit sans danger pour la peau, contrôlant avec précision l'émission de deux longueurs d'onde lumineuses spécifiques : la lumière rouge (630 nm) et la lumière proche infrarouge (830 nm). Chacune d’elles contribue à raffermir et lisser visiblement la peau tout en uniformisant le teint. Les tests en cours menés par L'Oréal viendront confirmer l’efficacité de la lumière rouge et proche infrarouge sur les ridules, le relâchement cutané ou encore l’irrégularité du teint.

Ce dispositif léger, portable et non invasif est conçu pour s'intégrer facilement aux routines de beauté quotidiennes, avec des sessions prédéfinies de 10 minutes.

LED Face Mask devrait être lancé en 2027*. Plus de détails, y compris les prix, seront disponibles sur loreal.com.

*Le lancement de LED Face Mask de L'Oréal Groupe aux États-Unis est soumis au processus de notification préalable de la FDA 510(k).

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IBM options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $295.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.60.
Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in International Business Machines Corp (Symbol: IBM) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 16th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 284 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IBM options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $295.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $295.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $266.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IBM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $296.61/share today.

Because the $295.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.69% return on the cash commitment, or 12.46% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for International Business Machines Corp, and highlighting in green where the $295.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $305.00 strike price has a current bid of $29.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of IBM stock at the current price level of $296.61/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $305.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.93% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IBM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for International Business Machines Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IBM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $305.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $305.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.10% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.98% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 33%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 249 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $296.61) to be 30%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Safety Standardization Mandatory Code / Insurance Specification and Recommendation:

SKYX's Safety Code Standardization Team is receiving support from a new significant prominent leader with its government safety agency’s process for a safety mandatory standardization of its electrical ceiling outlet/receptacle technology.

SKYX’s code team is led by industry veterans Mark Earley, former head of the National Electrical Code (NEC), and Eric Jacobson, former President and CEO of the American Lighting Association (ALA). The Company’s safety Code Standardization team believes it will garner assistance from additional safety organizations with its code mandatory safety standardization efforts based on the product’s significant safety aspects. Mr. Earley and Mr. Jacobson were instrumental in numerous code and safety changes in both the electrical and lighting industries. Both strongly believe that, considering the Company’s standardization progress including its product specification approval voting for by ANSI / NEMA (American National Standardization Institute / National Electrical Manufacturers Association) and being voted into 10 segments in the NEC Code Book, it has met the necessary safety conditions for becoming a ceiling safety standardization requirement for homes and buildings.

With respect to insurance companies, the Company strongly believes its products can save insurance companies many billions of dollars annually by reducing fires, ladder falls, and electrocutions among other things. Management expects that once it completes an entire range and variations of its safe advanced plug & play products it will start being recommended by insurance companies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management considers earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted, an important indicator in evaluating the Company’s business on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not part of the Company’s core operations, such as interest expense and amortization expense associated with intangible assets, or items that do not involve a cash outlay, such as share-based payments and non-recurring items, such as transaction costs. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows used in operating activities. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.

After years of price increases, shoppers may start to see some signs of relief at the grocery store as food giants look to reignite growth.

Cheerios and Nature Valley bar maker General Mills said last month it cut prices on nearly two-thirds of its grocery products in North America, resulting in an uptick in product volume. PepsiCo also plans to lower prices this year across some of its food products as it looks to improve affordability.

Consumer inflation concerns have weighed heavilyon product volumes in recent quarters. PepsiCo noted in October that volumes for snacks in North America dipped 4%, while beverages slumped 3%. Other food manufacturers, such as Conagra Brands, Kraft Heinz and J.M. Smucker, posted declines in volumes.

“Consumers represent two-thirds of the economy,” said Brian Choi, a managing partner and CEO of The Food Institute. “They’re tapped out.”

Food-at-home prices are forecast to be up 2.3% in 2026, a slight improvement from last year,according to data from the USDA’s Economic Research Service. Despite the increases, they mark a sharp decline from the COVID-19 pandemic when inflation on food prices hit afour-decade high.

Much of the recent price increase has come from commodities such as coffee and ground beef, which are up 18.8% and 14.9%, respectively, during the last year, Labor Department statistics showed. Candy and chewing gum prices jumped 10.1%, and essentials such as bananas, lettuce and cereals are also all more expensive.

General Mills noted that high prices are pushing more shoppers to purchase food that is being discounted, particularly among consumers earning $100,000 or less.

PepsiCo, which is looking to lower prices as part of a turnaround plan, has an “opportunity to reinvest in value in a more substantial way,” Ramon Laguarta, the beverage and snacking company’s CEO, said in December.

“There’s a big reset of affordability because we see the consumer struggling in the U.S. and in many Western countries,”he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.

Despite some cuts, there are still categories where food makers are raising prices to offset inflationary pressures. Sweets maker Hershey in 2025 said it would put in place a double-digit percentage price increase due to elevated cocoa costs.

Executives noted in October that while cocoa prices have moderated, theyremain 70% above 2023 levels and are likely to increase in 2026. Hershey raised consumer costs to catch up to other competitors, noting the industry is less synchronized when it comes to pricing.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xga7sYPwpobzO_wv_uc0R7JVncNTzJ_1ESn_Bv76t_I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMTgxMy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-05 11:15:20.777005

L’Oréal Groupe dévoile lors du CES 2026 deux nouvelles technologies qui mettent à profit la lumière infrarouge pour transformer les soins capillaires et cutanés : le Light Straight + Multi-styler et le LED Face Mask. « Chez L’Oréal, nous croyons depuis toujours que la beauté est profondément liée à la découverte scientifique, une conviction qui est au cœur de notre Groupe depuis plus de 115 ans. Cette année, au CES 2026, notre connaissance scientifique et le développement de technologies LED propriétaires sur le marché illustrent une nouvelle fois notre engagement à repousser les limites des nouvelles solutions beauté », déclare Barbara Lavernos, directrice générale adjointe en charge de la recherche, de l’innovation et de la technologie.

L’innovation du Light Straight + Multi-styler

À travers le temps, le fer à lisser est resté un outil incontournable pour le coiffage. Cependant, l’usage de plaques chauffantes qui montent jusqu’à 205 °C pose un problème de dégradation des cheveux. Une étude menée par L’Oréal en 2024 a révélé que 58 % des consommatrices américaines considèrent la chaleur comme la cause principale de l’endommagement de leur chevelure.

Pour répondre à cette problématique, L’Oréal a développé le Light Straight + Multi-styler. Cet outil intègre une technologie de lumière infrarouge brevetée, permettant de lisser les cheveux tout en réduisant la température à un maximum de 160 °C. Selon des tests instrumentaux, il agit trois fois plus rapidement que les fers à lisser traditionnels et rend les cheveux deux fois plus lisses.

La conception fignolée de l’appareil, qui utilise une lumière proche infrarouge, pénètre au cœur de la fibre capillaire, remaniant les structures moléculaires tout en préservant la santé des cheveux.« Light Straight + Multi-styler fait passer le coiffage de la correction à la prévention », ajoute Guive Balooch, vice-président du métier beauté augmentée et de l’open innovation. « Nous pensons que cette innovation établit un nouveau standard en matière de coiffage de précision », conclut-il.

The permit would allow the store to sell beer, wine, and liquor for off-premises consumption.
The application also indicates that the Ocala Police Department and Ocala Fire Rescue have reviewed the request and raised no objections.
Three other new Walmart locations are also planning to open their doors in January, including one in The Villages.","As a new Walmart Neighborhood Market in southeast Ocala nears completion ahead of its scheduled opening, the retailer is seeking city approval to sell beer, wine, and liquor at its new location.

During the Ocala City Council’s upcoming meeting on Tuesday, January 6, council members will consider a request from Wal-Mart Stores East, LP for the issuance of a location permit for the sale of beer, wine, and liquor at the company’s new store at 3535 SE Maricamp Road.

The new 47,914-square-foot building will feature approximately 166 parking spaces. The business will employ nearly 100 individuals.

Construction on the 47,914-square-foot grocery store is largely complete at Saddleback Square Shopping Center (formerly Cedar Shores). The new store, designated as Walmart #4245, is located at 3525 SE Maricamp Road.

​With the physical structure all but finished and the opening weeks away, the company has submitted a request to the City of Ocala for a “State 3PS” alcohol permit. The permit would allow the store to sell beer, wine, and liquor for off-premises consumption.

​According to the permit application, the store plans to sell alcohol between the hours of 7 a.m. and 2 a.m., Monday through Sunday, subject to city ordinances that limit Sunday sales hours.

​City staff have recommended approval of the request, noting that there are no schools, churches, or daycare centers within a 500-foot radius of the site. The application also indicates that the Ocala Police Department and Ocala Fire Rescue have reviewed the request and raised no objections. Police records show only three calls for service to the location in the past two years, all of which were self-initiated security checks.

​Once open, the new Neighborhood Market is expected to employ between 90 and 95 people. The site has been updated to provide 166 parking spaces—well above the city’s requirement of 47 spaces for a building of its size.

​The arrival of the new Walmart marks the culmination of a major redevelopment project for the shopping center, which had seen its anchor space sit vacant for nearly a decade before the former Winn-Dixie was demolished in 2024.

In late 2025, Walmart announced plans to launch four brand-new sites across Florida in early 2026, alongside remodels for dozens of existing stores to align with its modern “Store of the Future” concept.

The moves come from the firm’s latest note, headed by analyst Brent Thill, which urges investors to remain selective as “growth decelerates and lags versus other sectors like semis.”

Jefferies downgraded Adobe because “any contribution boost from AI has yet to show up,” noting that topline trends have been decelerating since fiscal 2023 and through Adobe’s fiscal 2026 guidance.

While the firm acknowledges that Adobe has made “significant progress with AI features since Firefly was announced in early 2023,” analysts argue that there is still “no AI inflection,” adding: “We do not see acceleration in total revs during our forecast period to FY30.”

Jefferies also cites investor concerns about long-term disruption to Adobe’s business model.

In contrast, Jefferies upgraded IBM to Buy, citing a clearer path to software momentum.

Thill says IBM is “rebooting software growth in ’26,” driven by Red Hat strength and synergies from recent and pending acquisitions, including HCP and Confluent.

The analyst writes that these deals “pave a clearer path to accelerated software growth,” while also enhancing IBM’s hybrid cloud and data capabilities.

Mainframe resilience and potential gains from generative AI monetisation through watsonx further support the upgrade, Jefferies says, arguing that operating leverage and synergy realisation should bolster margins and free cash flow heading into 2026.

Eli Lilly is a little expensive Eli Lilly's price advance over the past couple of years has pushed its valuation higher.
Eli Lilly isn't done yet To be fair, Eli Lilly is also working on new delivery methods for its GLP-1 drugs.
The real takeaway here is that Eli Lilly appears expensive today, with investors having priced in a significant amount of good news.
If you are concerned about the valuation of Eli Lilly, it may be prudent to take some profits.","Eli Lilly (LLY 3.41%) and Novo Nordisk (NVO +3.72%) are both highly respected pharmaceutical companies. However, their stock prices have traveled shockingly different paths over the past year or so, with Eli Lilly on the rise and Novo Nordisk falling sharply. Both price moves are the result of GLP-1 drugs. Has the good news played out for Eli Lilly?

What has happened with GLP-1 drugs?

Novo Nordisk was the first company to introduce GLP-1 drugs. This is a new category of drugs that helps people lose material amounts of weight very quickly. As long as patients continue to use the drug, the weight remains off. The drugs, currently delivered by needle, have been hailed as something of a miracle, especially for people who have had a hard time controlling their weight through diet and exercise alone.

There are negatives to GLP-1 drugs, including the fact that most patients who stop using the drugs gain back a lot of the lost weight. There's also the not-so-subtle fact that the weight loss involves both fat and muscle. Losing muscle is undesirable, particularly for older adults, as it increases the likelihood and negative impact of accidents, such as falls.

Still, customers are lining up to take GLP-1 drugs. Other pharmaceutical companies are also working hard on their own GLP-1 offerings. Eli Lilly came out with its version after Novo Nordisk, but it has quickly taken the lead in the new niche. It is now the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to GLP-1 shots. That's why Eli Lilly's stock has been performing well while Novo Nordisk's shares have been falling.

Eli Lilly is a little expensive

Eli Lilly's price advance over the past couple of years has pushed its valuation higher. While the price-to-earnings ratio is roughly in line with its five-year average, at around 53, it is not low on an absolute basis. For reference, the S&P 500's average P/E ratio is approximately 28, and the average technology stock, a sector known for being expensive, has a P/E of around 30. For an even more direct and stark comparison, the average P/E in the pharmaceutical sector is just under 10.

If you care at all about valuation, you should probably be asking yourself if it is time to sell Eli Lilly and lock in your profits. This is particularly relevant for Eli Lilly, as Novo Nordisk has recently introduced a new delivery method, a pill, for its GLP-1 drugs. Customers vastly prefer taking a pill to an injection, so this is a very big development. Novo Nordisk could regain some ground in the GLP-1 space after its pills start selling, likely in early 2026.

Given that Novo Nordisk's P/E ratio is around 15, about half of its five-year average P/E of 30, it appears more attractive from a valuation perspective. Its P/E is also far lower than Eli Lilly's P/E and much closer to the industry average. You might consider jumping into Novo Nordisk if you exit Eli Lilly. However, there's one small problem to consider here. The healthcare industry is driven by innovation, and new products are particularly important in the pharma segment of the industry.

Due to the significant costs associated with discovering and developing new drugs, pharmaceutical companies are granted the exclusive right to market and sell their new medications. But the patent protections are time-limited, so companies are always facing the day when those patents expire. Normally, this results in a patent cliff, which occurs when revenue from blockbuster drugs declines sharply due to the introduction of generic versions of the drugs. Even in the best-case scenario, a drug company has only a short window in which to generate huge profits.

However, the back and forth between Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly shows that patents alone aren't enough to protect a new drug. If a competitor introduces a more attractive drug that performs the same function, it will likely take the lead -- which is where another interesting alternative to Eli Lilly comes in, Pfizer (PFE 0.30%).

Pfizer dropped its own GLP-1 drug candidate, a significant setback. Meanwhile, several important drugs are set to lose their patent protections. The stock is deeply depressed, with a P/E ratio of just under 10. Investors appear to be very downbeat on the business right now.

However, Pfizer isn't sitting still. It recently acquired a company with a promising GLP-1 drug pipeline. And it agreed to distribute a Chinese company's GLP-1 drug if it gains regulatory approval. Given Wall Street's low expectations, Pfizer could be an interesting turnaround option in the drug sector and the GLP-1 race.

Eli Lilly isn't done yet

To be fair, Eli Lilly is also working on new delivery methods for its GLP-1 drugs. So, Novo Nordisk's pill could be a short-term benefit to the company, but it still may not change the long-term trends in the new drug niche. And there are clearly other companies working to topple both of the GLP-1 leaders, including Pfizer. The real takeaway here is that Eli Lilly appears expensive today, with investors having priced in a significant amount of good news.

Good news in the pharma sector tends to be short-lived, by design. If you are concerned about the valuation of Eli Lilly, it may be prudent to take some profits. You could buy Novo Nordisk, but an even better value play could be Pfizer, which investors appear to be treating as an industry also-ran. Yet Pfizer is just as capable as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in finding, developing, and marketing new drugs. History suggests that value-priced Pfizer will eventually turn its business around with its own innovation.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849185%2F25_03_14-a-person-with-their-hands-up-in-frustration-_mf-dload-gettyimages-1306802194-1200x711-5fd5365.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-05 11:05:02.514359

The quiet invasion

2025 came in low, didn’t kick in the door. Didn’t scream ‘new world’, didn’t settle a score. No revolution speech, no dramatic ignition. Quickly, quietly changing the room, while we sat in position. It wasn’t a scene from a movie, nay no robots in the street. Just a shift in rhythm, a change in beat. AI didn’t knock, didn’t wait for its turn. Didn’t ask the boardroom what it’s allowed to learn. It slid into the walls, into the processes, into the pace. Into how work moves, decides and accelerates. Embedded in the drywall, living in the code. Rewriting rules of our heavy workload.

Zoom out wide, watch the skyline bend. When scale started folding, it wasn’t about a trend. It was heavy systems learning how to move light. Overlap costs more than the value of size, right? Brands felt the squeeze, yeah, every channel pulled. Every platform claimed it’s the place where you ruled. Too many voices, and not enough core. Consolidation wasn’t fear, it’s physics at play. Gravity speaking in a very clear way.

The engine room

Take it back to the engine room, where the real shift stayed. This wasn’t better tools; it was how work gets made. We talk about speed but look at the chain. Agent speaks to agent, creating new brains. Work now moves faster than your coffee can cool. Decisions are being learnt, while we’re choosing tools. Agentic AI. Don’t soften the phrase, It’s not a helper on call for the lazy days. It’s momentum in play; it’s the gear and the clutch. Not just automation of tasks that you used to touch. But systems deciding what happens next too. The friction is gone; the view is brand new.

The shadow of silence

And here’s what we whisper, not what we say loud. When friction disappears, fear gathers a crowd. Because speed feels like replacement when roles feel thin. When you don’t know where you add weight within. Let’s be clear – AI doesn’t eliminate people, that’s not the crime, Confusion does. Silence does. Neglect over time. Ignoring the human while upgrading the brain is how intelligence quietly turns into strain. Automation isn’t free, it just moves the bill. From hours to outcomes. From doing the work to deciding what’s right. So, people matter more, not less, not reduced. Agents can act, but they can’t choose the truth.

The cost and the cut

Here’s where the people cost enters sharp and clean. Where spreadsheets pretend that humans are screens. Margins tighten up. Finance circles the room. AI looks like relief. Cuts feel like a broom. But cut without thinking and you sever the spine. Amputate futures just to feel fine? For a quarter in time, you lose the long game. People cost isn’t expense – uh, uh – that’s a rookie name. It’s stored return. It’s the bank vault door. Unrealised potential waiting for more. Don’t reskill them? The gaps show fast. Don’t upskill them? The systems run past. Don’t mentor them? Relevance dies. Flattened by workflows they’ll never learned to guide.

The operating system

Training isn’t a programme you tick and forget; it’s an operating system you constantly set. Not videos watched at 1.5x on a screen, But how to lead systems you didn’t build, but you mean to mean. Teach how agents work, where the bias creeps in. How to question the output before damage begins. How to push creatively, not blindly comply. How to say, ‘technically right, but emotionally dry’. Because emotion isn’t noise, it’s market signal. Brands live in feeling, not logical ritual. No agent understands pride, shame, fear, or hope. Like a human who’s lived and learned how to cope.

The strategy

So here is the math you cannot ignore, The only investment that settles the score: Mentorship becomes insurance. Training becomes retention. Empathy becomes performance.

AI won’t replace the workforce whole. But people who evolve will replace static roles. More jobs will come, but not the same shape. Hybrid minds setting the new escape. Leadership splits clean as the pressure grows. Those who step up. Those who master this new prose. You can automate output, automate scale. But care doesn’t code and culture won’t jailbreak.

Here’s the close, no padding, no spin: Efficiency will be cheap, it’ll be the price of admission. Advantage would be the culture, the soul and the mission. AI won’t decide who stays in the game. Markets will. Clients will. Talent will name. They’ll see who built muscle, and who cut the bone, Who treated their people as the throne, not the stone. In 2026, the machine will be the means. People will be the strategy. Mic drop.",https://campaignme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tahaab-Rais-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 13:01:38.719608

In reality, especially across the Middle East they could be the best tandem since oxygen and fire. When aligned, they don’t cancel each other out. They ignite growth, connection and long-term brand value.

And this isn’t limited to consumer brands. Some of the most exciting progress is happening in the business-to-businsess (B2B) segment, where sustainability can be a strong commercial driver. A standout example from the Middle East is ‘Move to -15’ by DP World, a UAE-based campaign rallying shipping companies and freight partners to cut emissions by 15 per cent. It reframed sustainability from a compliance burden into a competitive advantage.

Purpose that pays: Data-driven proof

According to Brand Finance’s 2025 Sustainability Perceptions Index (SPI), sustainability now drives a meaningful share of consumer demand. In categories such as automotive, discretionary fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), professional services and luxury, sustainability perceptions influence between 4 per cent and 23 per cent of demand – making it one of the most powerful commercial drivers in any brand toolkit.

WARC’s analysis of a decade of its Effective 100 reinforces the same story: one in four of the world’s most effective campaigns used environment or social purpose as a central theme. Brands that engage people with meaningful issues don’t lose commercial impact – they multiply it. The evidence is clear: sustainability isn’t a cost. It’s an accelerant.

A ‘MINI MBA’ BRINGING CMOS & CSOS TOGETHER

The International Advertising Association, together with sustainable marketing pioneer Thomas Kolster is launching a new mini-MBA programme, which brings chief marketing officers (CMOs) and chief sustainability officers (CSOs) together.

The programme is taught by leading CMOs and CSOs from brands such as P&G and Tony’s Chocolonely.

Why the Middle East is primed for this partnership

The region is in the midst of rapid economic, generational and cultural change. Young populations, rising environmental awareness and fast-evolving consumer expectations create fertile ground for purpose-fuelled growth.

People in the Middle East don’t want moral lectures. They want better choices: cleaner cities, healthier food, smarter mobility and stronger futures. Every year, I witness better and more meaningful work coming from the region, which is also reflected in the WARC research.

This is where marketing and sustainability complement each other perfectly. Sustainability brings the substance. Marketing brings the spark. When the two align, they transform complex topics into human stories: progress over perfection, empowerment over guilt and innovation over sacrifice.

What it looks like when it works

Authentic storytelling backed by credible action: SPI shows that brands lose billions in value when perception and performance don’t align. Marketing cannot fix an empty sustainability story, but it can amplify a real one.

Campaigns that connect emotionally, not morally: WARC’s most effective purpose campaigns didn’t preach. They made people feel something and made sustainability relevant to everyday life. That approach resonates strongly across the Middle East, where emotional storytelling and cultural nuance matter more than corporate jargon.

Positioning sustainability as value, not sacrifice: When sustainability is framed as smarter, healthier and more aspirational living, people lean in. When it’s framed as a restriction, they tune out. Marketing’s job is to translate environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks into benefits people can actually see, taste, feel and enjoy.

A positive call – not for perfection, but for partnership

Sustainability doesn’t succeed through moral superiority; it succeeds through collaboration. Through building trust, not fear. If sustainability is oxygen, marketing is the fire – one provides the fuel, the other sets it alight.

The future belongs to brands that realise the two aren’t rivals but co-architects of value. The Middle East has everything it needs to lead this shift: ambition, innovation, young talent, and a consumer base hungry for brands that matter.

The moment we stop seeing marketing and sustainability as opposing forces, we unlock the most powerful growth engine of the next decade: purpose-driven brands that are both commercially sharp and culturally relevant.",https://campaignme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/thomas-loster.png,N,,2026-01-05 12:01:29.473916

Using the Model Control Protocol (MCP), invented by Anthropic, has been “so helpful” for Kepler, Xu said.
Nonetheless, running an agent-based internal data analysis tool seems to bring a lot of value to the company.","For OpenAI employees, asking a question even as seemingly simple as how many ChatGPT Pro users it has in one particular country can be surprisingly difficult, given that the needed data may be stretched be across multiple data sources, each of which is accessible in a slightly different way.

Overall, OpenAI has 70,000 different data sets, amassing 600PBs of new data daily. About 3,500 employees can access this data, using any 1 of 15 tools. The company has always kept close count of its users, but as it adds more regions and plans and features, tallying numbers becomes more difficult.

But each new query brought its own challenges. So analysts frequently found themselves in extended Slack conversations or even meetings with their peers just to figure out how to access the data.

“Simple questions shouldn’t be this difficult, or time consuming,” said Bonnie Xu, OpenAI technical staff member on the data productivity team, during a talk at QCON AI conference, held in New York last month.

Xu was there to discuss a tool the company created, called Kepler, to streamline this process.

Kepler is a helpful agent designed to answers questions for OpenAI employees, hiding the sometimes-many tasks it must undertake to find the answer.

Originally, Kepler was designed primarily for the data scientists at the company, but since its launch the user base has expanded to other personal in finance, human resources and other departments.

One Kepler user, according to Xu, actually said it was the closest they’ve experienced an AI system come to AGI.

OpenAI’s Challenges in Internal Data Retrieval

For the business analyst, many of the database tables might appear very similar. One database may include logged-out users, while another does not. Some tables included encrypted users, while others do not and must have that data joined into the resulting dataset. Which one to use?

Writing the correct SQL code to extract the data can be difficult as well, especially if they involve joins across different tables.

“Missing one nuance can lead to an answer that is wrong by an order of magnitude, and this can be catastrophic when making important business decisions,” Xu said.

Kepler in Action

Built in-house, Kepler is a data analyst, one that can tap all of OpenAI’s internal data stores to answer questions. OpenAI employees can interface with Kepler through Slack or through an IDE, such as Cursor, or by integration with a specific workflow, or by mobile or other remote clients. In the background, Kepler uses GPT-5 to parse the request.

To provide an example of how Kepler works, Xu walked through a question about New York taxi travels times, She wanted to know which times during the day have the most variance in travel times, as well as which journeys are the “most unreliable,” meaning location pairs (origin and destination) where the variance between the shortest and longest travel times is the greatest.

The demo showed the “chain of thought,” or a series of evaluations and actions, that Kepler executed to answer this question.

First, it does an internal knowledge search, identifying two potentially relevant datasets, including a 2016 collection of NYC travel time data for taxis, which included pick up and drop off times, and the zip codes of both the destination and departure locations.

The agent then calculated the median time for each zip code, identifying the 95th and 99th percentiles. The agent makes educated guesses on how to write the appropriate queries to get the needed information, testing each one, and soon finds one that works.

“You can imagine, doing this manually yourself takes a lot of time, but the agent is just going through these query and result steps on your behalf,” Xu said. When the queries appear to be correct, it sorts the results, then does some light formatting and even prepares a chart to present the data to the user. (The answers showed that rush hours and late nights are the most unreliable times.)

Another demo Xu provided showed Kepler working through a question of why there was a big spike in ChatGPT users in March 2025. It consulted a dashboard and a mission document to find the table that displayed this data. Kepler wrote different queries to try to pinpoint the sudden increase in usage, such as querying by region. It looked for errors, such as log data duplication.

The chain-of-thought identified a possible reason, namely the launch of a new generative image feature. They did a web search to cross-reference the hypothesis, finding the release notes and news articles on the launch.

Kepler stores all the questions, so you can pick up follow-up threads later on. When asked a follow-up question about taxi rides on February 14, Valentine’s Day, shows that the agent knows which tables and queries to use.

You can also interrupt Kepler if you see from its chain of thought that it is going in the wrong direction.

And since analysts tend to ask the same type of questions, such as product analysis and data validation, Kepler keeps sets of custom workflows for these sorts of questions

How Kepler Works

At its core, Kepler is a set of APIs that communicate directly with ChatGPT (currently version 5). Kepler also has direct connections to a set of pre-processed information, including an internal data knowledge base and an internal documents service. It can also make calls to data warehouses and other data services running on Apache Spark, Airflow and other platforms.

Using the Model Control Protocol (MCP), invented by Anthropic, has been “so helpful” for Kepler, Xu said. Kepler uses the internal documents to understand how to query databases or perform other tasks on MCP. If the results didn’t come out as expected, it can then rerun the query with slight modifications. In effect, the Kepler agent is reasoning by itself.

“So instead of you giving the feedback, Kepler is running tools, then using the right tools to take the next set of steps, depending on whatever feedback that’s given,” Xu said.

Typically, agents running on their own can return wildly inaccurate results, but with additional context in hand, they can understand when something is wrong and try to vary their approach.

“So the really lovely thing is that Kepler can interactively explore the data itself, and content is carried over the whole time,” she said.

The Importance of Metadata

Also helping build out the context is the metadata.

“It’s not enough to look at the table by itself, just as it is. You need to understand how the table was created and where it came from,” Xu said. This is the secret to the agent really understanding the differences between tables.

An offline job is run to compile this information about each table.

Much of this data has already been compiled by the company. Rich metadata about each database table has been captured, such as why it was created and what it is being used for, and even what its primary keys are.

It also uses codex generation to build out metadata from the code itself.

“Since this is all refreshed periodically by an offline job, the context stays fresh without any manual involvement.”

If Kepler, or a user, finds an error, it saves the correction in memory.

“For us, memory is really the mechanism that helps the agent continuously learn and improve,” Xu said. “Contacts will get you maybe 80 – 90% of the way there. But sometimes you need those final little corrections that are really hard to just infer.”

To evaluate the quality of the answers, OpenAI runs an Eval Grader, which offers a score for each answer tested. It looks at how the delivered results differ from the expected or correct results.

In many cases, a correct answer may have a slightly different SQL query than what was expected, but the development team plans for this.

“When we compare resolve tests, we actually give a little wiggle room with things that don’t meaningfully impact the answer,” Xu said.

Users bring their own credentials to Kepler, thus ensuring they don’t see any data that they don’t have permission to see.

Future Steps for Kepler

At present, OpenAI has no plans to open source Kepler or offer it as an enterprise product, Xu said, noting that she isn’t in the position to make these decisions.

Nonetheless, running an agent-based internal data analysis tool seems to bring a lot of value to the company.

“I think at least from what we’ve heard from our users, directly using Kepler is a lot faster. It’s more productive, just because when you’re looking at different sources, that’s a lot of stuff you have to do, and you have to connect the dots,” Xu said. “Kepler is really that layer on top, that abstraction that does it for you.”

Industry participants have said delays add near-term uncertainty for RIN values and blending economics, particularly as refiners assess compliance strategies for 2026.
The EPA had originally said it expected to finalise the RVO rules before the statutory deadline of 30 November 2025.
Once finalised, the RVO rule will determine blending obligations and compliance deadlines for biofuel producers and refiners in 2026 and 2027.","The EPA’s filing came in response to an 8 December order directing the agency to provide an update on its progress and timeline for establishing RVO mandates for the next two years, the 16 December report said.

According to the filing, the delayed response was due to pending multiple interagency reviews and consultations.

The order stemmed from ongoing litigation brought by HF Sinclair Refining & Marketing, HF Sinclair Parco Refining and Alon Refining Krotz Springs, challenging the EPA’s August decision to deny their small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions for 2024 compliance, the report said.

In June, the EPA released a proposed rule, referred to as “Set 2”, for 2026 and 2027. The proposal also aimed to limit imported biofuels and feedstocks, eliminate electricity from the RFS programme, and reduce the 2025 cellulosic RVO, while setting higher biodiesel blending targets, S&P Global wrote.

Market participants are waiting for further guidance on the 45Z tax credit and the RVO finalisation, as both policies play a key role in biofuels margins, according to the report.

Industry participants have said delays add near-term uncertainty for RIN values and blending economics, particularly as refiners assess compliance strategies for 2026.

A public comment period closed in August, followed by a supplemental proposal in September that explored reallocating volumes waived under the small refinery exemption programme, the report said.

The EPA had originally said it expected to finalise the RVO rules before the statutory deadline of 30 November 2025.

In its 15 December filing, the EPA said it was working to finalise the standards, noting that more than 2,000 public comments had been submitted.

It was coordinating with other federal agencies and addressing technical issues, including a regulatory impact analysis of the proposed volumes, the report said.

Once finalised, the RVO rule will determine blending obligations and compliance deadlines for biofuel producers and refiners in 2026 and 2027.

The 2025 RVO will expire on 31 January 2026, unless the EPA finalises the 2026 obligations earlier, in which case compliance deadlines would roll forward; otherwise, statutory deadlines would be moved forward to 1 June 2026, according to the EPA.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/US-biodiesel-Adobe-Stock-sized.jpg?mtime=1715763295,N,,2026-01-05 10:02:26.938746

An increasing number of American boys and young men are “t-maxxing” — taking testosterone when they don’t have a medical reason. They are motivated by social media influencers who tend to say that marriage is for weak men, physical dominance is key, and environmental and social concerns are not masculine. But surveys show that young men are struggling badly. An upcoming event focuses on these struggles. Our guests examine the issues:

Joseph Henderson, Ph.D., visiting faculty member at the University of Vermont

Shawndel N. Fraser, environmental psychologist and field researcher

Then in our second hour, we sit down with Michael Solis, executive director of Writers & Books. Solis is an author and international development professional who has worked across the globe. He took the helm of the literary nonprofit in September. As a new year unfolds, Solis joins us to discuss his vision for Writers & Books and how it will impact the community. We also explore the state of the current literary industry and what it means for readers and writers. In studio:

The columns delineate primary functional families: Group 1: Reactive (S1), Group 2: Retrieval (S2), Group 3: Orchestration (S3), Group 4: Validation (S4), and Group 5: Models (S5).
For instance, the most fundamental reactive primitive is the Prompt (Pr), which dictates instructions to an AI.
Under the “Reactive” column (S1), Row 1 is Prompt (Pr), Row 2 is Function Call (Fc), and Row 3 is Agent (Ag).
The emergent row (Row 4) highlights areas where the field is currently innovating rapidly, such as Multi-agent systems (Ma) and Synthetic data (Sy).","Martin Keen, a Master Inventor at IBM, recently introduced a compelling conceptual framework for understanding the rapidly expanding universe of Artificial Intelligence components: the AI Periodic Table. Keen spoke with IBM Tech about this structure, designed to map concepts like LLMs, RAG, and AI agent frameworks into a clear, organized taxonomy, much like the elements of chemistry. This approach is vital because, as Keen noted, “What if the world of AI felt a bit like this to you? A thousand terms flying around, everyone’s talking about agents and RAG and embeddings…” The immediate utility of this table is providing a stable, predictable reaction structure to the chaos of modern AI terminology.

The structure Keen presented organizes AI components across two axes: rows representing the stage of maturity or development, and columns representing functional groupings. The rows are categorized as: Row 1: Primitives (the foundational elements), Row 2: Compositions (how primitives are combined), Row 3: Deployment (elements critical for production systems), and Row 4: Emerging (nascent concepts). The columns delineate primary functional families: Group 1: Reactive (S1), Group 2: Retrieval (S2), Group 3: Orchestration (S3), Group 4: Validation (S4), and Group 5: Models (S5).

The core insight here is that AI architectures are not random but follow predictable patterns of combination, much like chemical bonding. For instance, the most fundamental reactive primitive is the Prompt (Pr), which dictates instructions to an AI. This element sits at the intersection of the “Reactive” family and the “Primitives” row.

Keen explicitly mapped the core building blocks of contemporary AI systems onto this grid. Under the “Reactive” column (S1), Row 1 is Prompt (Pr), Row 2 is Function Call (Fc), and Row 3 is Agent (Ag). The “Retrieval” column (S2) features Embeddings (Em) as the primitive, Vector databases (Vx) as the composition, and Finetuning (Ft) for deployment readiness. This organization immediately clarifies dependencies; for example, RAG (Rg) is clearly a composition of Retrieval (Em) and Orchestration (Rg).

A key principle underpinning this table is reactivity versus inertness. Keen observed that some elements, like Prompts, are highly reactive: “Because prompts are reactive, you change one word in your prompt, while you’re going to get a completely different output.” Conversely, elements in the Models column (S5), such as the Large Language Model (Lg/LLM), are more like noble gases—stable and foundational.

The framework elegantly situates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as a composition (Row 2) combining Embeddings (Em) from the Retrieval column (S2) with the Orchestration (Rg) column (S3). This positioning underscores that RAG is not a standalone primitive but a deliberate assembly of existing components to ground LLM outputs in specific, verifiable data.

The emergent row (Row 4) highlights areas where the field is currently innovating rapidly, such as Multi-agent systems (Ma) and Synthetic data (Sy). These are not yet fully standardized deployment components but represent the next wave of complexity and capability. For venture capitalists and founders, this table serves as an immediate diagnostic tool. When evaluating a new AI product, one can quickly identify which “elements” it utilizes and how they are combined, revealing the system’s sophistication and reliance on established versus cutting-edge techniques.

The explicit mapping of these concepts clarifies the relationships that often baffle newcomers. For instance, the Agent (Ag) primitive in Row 3, Deployment, is shown looping back to the Prompt (Pr) primitive, illustrating the Agent’s ability to generate its own reasoning steps and prompts iteratively. This visual representation transforms a confusing array of buzzwords into a coherent, navigable architectural map.",https://www.startuphub.ai/wp-content/uploads/ai-periodic-table-1024x576.webp,N,,2026-01-05 11:05:19.030508

The FTC has reached a settlement with Instacart to resolve allegations that the company misled consumers regarding its tipping practices for delivery workers. According to the FTC’s press release, the Commission alleged that Instacart’s representations led consumers to believe their entire tip would go to workers, when in fact Instacart retained a portion for itself, in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Under the terms of the settlement, Instacart will provide $60 million in refunds to affected consumers and is required to change its disclosures about how tips are distributed. Beyond the refund, the settlement order prohibits Instacart from making misrepresentations about the costs of its delivery services and satisfaction guarantees. Additionally, Instacart is instructed to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms, and obtain express informed consent from consumers, for any subscription transactions that involve automatic charges unless the consumer actively opts out.

The FTC took enforcement action against Adamas Amenity Services LLC, a building services contractor, and its affiliated businesses for allegedly participating in unlawful no-hire agreements that restricted the recruitment and hiring of certain employees. As described in the FTC’s press release, the Commission alleges that the companies entered into no-hire agreements to restrict other building owners and management companies across New Jersey and New York City to hire Adamas employees—mainly workers performing janitorial, front desk, security, and other services—without incurring a large penalty. According to the complaint, these arrangements diminished competition in labor markets, limited employment opportunities, and potentially suppressed wages—conduct that purportedly violates Section 5 of the FTC Act. As part of the order, Adamas is barred from the use of these no-hire agreements, must notify employees affected by past no-hire agreements, and must post clear and conspicuous notice that employees are no longer subject to no-hire agreements.

On January 5, Jefferies adopted a more cautious stance on Adobe, reducing its rating and cutting the price target from $500 to $400.
Analysts cited a strategic realignment across the sector as the core reason: The firm anticipates a deceleration in software sector growth by 2026.
At the recent price of $333.30, Adobe trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.6.
However, current trading is being driven more by sector rotation and technical trends than by such valuation models.","Adobe's stock is encountering significant headwinds following a major rating downgrade by the investment firm Jefferies. The bank has shifted its recommendation from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" concurrently slashing its price target substantially. This move comes as technical indicators for the stock deteriorate, even though its valuation appears attractive in a historical and sector-wide context. The situation raises questions about a potential broad re-rating of the software industry.

On January 5, Jefferies adopted a more cautious stance on Adobe, reducing its rating and cutting the price target from $500 to $400. Analysts cited a strategic realignment across the sector as the core reason:

The firm anticipates a deceleration in software sector growth by 2026.

Other technology segments, such as semiconductors, are now viewed as more attractive investment opportunities.

The monetization of Adobe's artificial intelligence features is progressing more slowly than previously forecast.

Consequently, Jefferies advises an underweight position in software equities for the first half of 2026, favoring infrastructure investments instead.

Diverging Views on Financial Prospects

Research firms present conflicting outlooks regarding Adobe's earnings trajectory, highlighting market uncertainty:

Jefferies (January 5): Downgraded to ""Hold,"" citing sluggish AI revenue conversion and broader sector headwinds.

Zacks Research (December 31): Raised its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Adobe. The Q1 2026 forecast was lifted to $4.80 per share, with the full-year 2026 expectation increased to $19.00.

This juxtaposition of rising profit estimates and falling price targets underscores the current debate over appropriate valuation levels and multiple expansion.

Technical Picture Turns Bearish

The market's reaction has exacerbated an already weak technical setup. The stock recently traded around $333.30, marking a notable decline from recent sessions.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

The share price has fallen below its 8-, 50-, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs).

Analysis platforms currently classify the trend as ""strongly bearish.""

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near 39, indicating sustained downward pressure, though it is approaching oversold territory.

In the short term, momentum and trend-following signals are dominating market perception.

Valuation Contrasts with Prevailing Mood

From a fundamental perspective, a different narrative emerges. At the recent price of $333.30, Adobe trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.6.

This compares to a sector average P/E of 31.7.

Direct competitors command an average P/E multiple of approximately 56.

Financial models from Simply Wall St., using a discounted cash flow approach, suggest a fair value of $521.39 per share. Theoretically, this implies the stock could be undervalued by more than 30%. However, current trading is being driven more by sector rotation and technical trends than by such valuation models.

Institutional Activity Shows Mixed Signals

Recent regulatory filings reveal divergent moves among major investors during the third quarter of 2025. Davis Capital Management established a new position, acquiring approximately 4,009 shares. In contrast, Miracle Mile Advisors reduced its holdings by 56.7% in the same period.

Overall, institutional investors currently hold about 81.79% of Adobe's outstanding shares, meaning professional market participants continue to exert a strong influence on price discovery.

With the stock near $333 and Jefferies' new $400 target, the market is now testing whether the relatively low valuation will provide meaningful support or if the negative sector trend will push shares further toward their 52-week lows.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2423322_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:04:51.727668

Investors are weighing this price in relation to its current earnings profile and broader pharmaceutical portfolio.

Recent trading has been relatively steady, but a 30 day share price return of 6.93% and a 90 day share price return of 28.06% sit alongside a 1 year total shareholder return of 42.26% and a very large 5 year total shareholder return. This combination suggests that momentum has been building over time as investors reassess growth prospects and risk.

If Eli Lilly has caught your eye, this could be a moment to see how it lines up against other that might fit a similar role in your portfolio.

With Eli Lilly trading near its recent highs and showing an intrinsic discount estimate alongside only a small gap to its analyst price target, the key question is whether the stock is undervalued or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.2% Undervalued

Compared with Eli Lilly's last close at $1,080.36, the narrative fair value of $1,189.18 points to a higher price that the author views as justified.

Catalysts

• Mounjaro/Zepbound: Lilly’s tirzepatide franchise is the engine of growth. Mounjaro (for type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (obesity) each grew rapidly in 2024. Analysts project Mounjaro sales of $18.4 B in 2025 and $22.8B in 2026, and Zepbound jumping from $4.9B (2024) to $12.5 B in 2025 (and $18.1B in 2026). In other words, Lilly’s tirzepatide sales are expected to surpass Novo’s by 2026.

Curious what kind of revenue run rate and profit margin could support that price, and what future earnings multiple the narrative leans on? The assumptions behind this fair value knit together aggressive GLP 1 volume expectations, premium pricing, and a profit profile more often linked with high growth sectors. Want to see exactly how those building blocks add up to that valuation target?

Result: Fair Value of $1,189.18 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there is still real risk that high GLP 1 pricing faces pushback, or that safety concerns, lawsuits, or production delays limit the long term opportunity investors expect.

Another View: What The Market Multiple Is Saying

That user narrative leans on strong growth to support a higher fair value, but the current P/E of 52.5x paints a different picture. It is far above the US Pharmaceuticals industry at 19.9x and peers at 16.6x, and even above a fair ratio of 42.5x, which points to valuation risk if expectations cool.

Monday

Being a lark rather than an owl definitely works in my favour when you’re part of a charity whose biggest impact happens first thing each weekday morning in over 1,000 schools across England and Scotland. I’m usually up at 5am - today’s no different - and start with the ritual of brewing a black filter coffee. My mornings are when I move the most important things forward. Today I’m drafting remarks for two events and finishing the Breakfast Briefing, our all-staff newsletter rounding up last week’s work, celebrating wins, and sharing what’s ahead. I write or contribute to it every week, and it’s become a grounding way to start Mondays.

Once “focus time” ends, I join our weekly leadership huddle before chairing the Senior Leadership Team meeting. Autumn is always a busy period for Magic Breakfast, and this year even more so, with our involvement in government pilots in England and Scotland shaping how our work evolves. Much of Monday is spent considering how we maintain continuity of breakfasts for more than 300,000 pupils while strengthening our advocacy efforts. It’s a day that reminds me how much coordination and clarity matter.

Tuesday

The day starts with some quiet focus before I take Arthur, our 13-year-old cockapoo, for his morning walk, a reliable reminder to step away from the desk. The walk is also a welcome opportunity to listen to a podcast.

In the afternoon I head to the House of Commons to speak at the Kellogg’s Breakfast Club Awards. It’s great to catch up with the Minister and others in the sector, including teachers and school leaders. Interest in the benefits of school breakfast is far higher than when I joined Magic Breakfast four years ago, and we’re keen to build on that momentum. The highlight is presenting the Breakfast Club Hero Award to 15-year-old Seth, who helps run his secondary school’s breakfast provision and champions support for older pupils. His passion is a brilliant reminder of why youth voice matters.

Wednesday

A strong start to the day: a visit to a long-term partner school in Tower Hamlets with senior leaders from Kraft Heinz. As one of Magic Breakfast’s biggest supporters, their team is genuinely passionate about our mission, and it’s valuable for them to see the real-world impact of their support. We also discuss an upcoming volunteering day for their staff.

I catch up with the school’s staff and hear what’s new - they’re always adapting based on pupils’ feedback. They’ve introduced new cereal containers so children can serve themselves more easily (and tidily!), and the reading corner added last year is now a firm favourite. A recent parent engagement event was a success, and more are planned. Visiting schools always reconnects me with the practical details that sit behind our strategy.

Between meetings, I call my mum, who says she’s thinking of retiring… I’ll believe it when I see it!

Thursday

Today is a key day for Magic Breakfast. I’m in a full-day workshop with staff leading major transformation initiatives aimed at making our operations more scalable and efficient. It’s a chance to check and challenge timings, sequencing and dependencies. We don’t yet know what any future commitments to universal breakfast clubs for primary pupils in England might mean, but we do know pressures on costs and fundraising continue. Our focus is on progressing “no regret” decisions - choices that strengthen us regardless of the policy landscape - so we can maximise our impact for as many pupils as possible.

Working in an organisation that advocates for and secures change means we must evolve too. This evening is pivotal as we launch Nourishing Futures, our strategy for 2040. Nourishing Futures puts children and young people’s experiences at the centre of our work, building on evidence that shows how a school breakfast can foster connection, calm and confidence. It’s an energising evening and incredibly special to have so many supporters and friends of Magic Breakfast together. Days like this balance the operational challenge with the long-term hope.

Friday

Friday begins with a long run - a perfect way for an introvert to recharge after a packed week. I head to our London office with Arthur in tow and have a monthly catch-up with Phil Davies, one of our trustees. Phil’s role as Global Head of Operations at Morgan Stanley brings invaluable insight to Magic Breakfast, and I always appreciate his counsel.

On the way, I listen to The Food Programme, which this week explores school breakfasts. I’m keen to hear the range of voices, including the interview with Jacquie, our Director of Policy and Engagement, outlining our work and the emerging opportunities and challenges for breakfast club policy in England. Later, I’m interviewed by a researcher, contributing to the Department for Education’s parent-led research on the effectiveness of school breakfast models, food, and budgets - another valuable opportunity to input at a critical stage of testing and learning.

I’m grateful to end the week, with my husband, at the National Theatre for a performance by jazz musician Nala Sinephro. Live performances give me real space to step away from work, and tonight it’s the perfect start to the weekend.

Now They're Aiming for the Olympics,Alice Park,,,,,https://time.com/7341942/alex-maia-shibutani-olympics-2026-comeback-interview/,"Skier Lindsey Vonn qualified for her fifth Olympic team after retiring in 2019.
Still, despite the warm welcome back they’ve received, their spot on the Olympic team isn’t a sure thing.
On the ice, 4-year-old Maia found an outlet for her budding musicality, making up choreography as she went.
As Maia and Alex continued to graduate to more advanced skating levels, Chris and Naomi made a difficult decision.
Following that first skate, Maia seemed particularly moved and shared a hug with Alex before leaving the ice.","And yet for all they accomplished, they did not spend the years after those Games collecting hardware. Instead, they stepped away from competition indefinitely, exploring their own interests, deepening their understanding of their identity as Asian Americans, and facing personal struggles including a cancer diagnosis for Maia. So when they announced in May that they intended to return, after seven years away from competitive skating, with an eye on the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, the skating community responded with much enthusiasm.

“When we heard they were coming back, for me personally it was something I understood because we all know the pull of the Olympic Games,” says Evan Bates, who with partner Madison Chock has won six U.S. national championships, three world championships, and a team gold in Beijing in 2022. “It’s exciting, and it’s good for the sport.”

The Shibutanis, now 31 and 34, aren’t the only decorated athletes expected to make a comeback at these Games. Skier Lindsey Vonn qualified for her fifth Olympic team after retiring in 2019. Skater Alysa Liu took two years off after her first Olympics in 2022 before returning to try to make her second team. Another 2022 Olympian, snowboarder Jamie Anderson, is training for her second Games after having two children, and bobsledder Kaillie Humphries is also prepping for another possible Olympic appearance—what could be her fifth—after having her first child in 2024. But the Shibutanis had been away the longest, and although ice dancers can sometimes eke out a few more years than other figure skaters, no ice-dance team has left competition for so much time before returning to contend at the elite level.

Still, despite the warm welcome back they’ve received, their spot on the Olympic team isn’t a sure thing. In their first two competitions of the season, they posted respectable scores but not high enough to land them on the podium. But that wasn’t the point of this comeback, says Maia. “If you asked me what we scored seven or ten years ago, I honestly wouldn’t be able to tell you,” she says. “What I have taken with me in my life is the strength that can only be gained from experiencing and overcoming hardship.”

Their journey also hasn’t followed a completely feel-good narrative. Earlier this fall, a video circulated showing Alex confronting his sister during a training session, complaining about her attitude and criticizing how she performed a skill. He vented his frustration with insults that some who viewed the exchange considered bullying, ranting for about 10 minutes as Maia mostly stood silently. “I let my emotions get the best of me,” Alex tells TIME in an email. “I apologized to Maia that day, remain deeply sorry, and am committed to being a better teammate.”

Now the two are trying to put that behind them and focus on the future. Their next big test will come at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis, Mo., where on Jan. 11 the U.S. will reveal Team USA’s Olympic figure-skating team, including the three ice-dancing pairs it will send to Italy. Among the competition will be Bates and Chock, whom the Shibutanis haven’t faced in the same event this season. “It’s going to be exciting,” says Bates. “Our U.S. fleet of ice dancers is really strong.”

It was Maia and Alex’s mother Naomi who first suggested the siblings skate together. Maia was enamored with skating from an early age after discovering it at birthday parties. Both Naomi and her husband, Chris, are trained musicians, and the siblings grew up surrounded by music. On the ice, 4-year-old Maia found an outlet for her budding musicality, making up choreography as she went.

Alex was a more reluctant participant, dutifully tagging along during Maia’s lessons, but more interested in mirroring Michael Jordan’s career on the basketball court. When he had to pick a team sport to satisfy a school PE requirement, though, Naomi suggested the kids, then 9 and 12, pair up on the ice. After all, two makes a team.

Mother, it turns out, knew best. Very quickly, the Shibutanis caught the eye of Susan Kelley and Andrew Stroukoff, who represented the U.S. at ice dance’s first appearance as an Olympic event, in 1976. With their encouragement, the siblings shot up the ranks, and at their first juvenile nationals a few years later, they finished second.

It helped that they started with one of the best coaches for learning proper skating technique—Slavka Kohout, who trained five-time U.S. national champion Janet Lynn. Kohout’s students were known for their deep edges and precision bladework, which provided a perfect foundation for high-level ice-dance skills.

At one point their parents took them to the world championships in Washington, D.C., where they got their first in-person taste of elite-level competition. They had rink-side seats, and Alex recalls being impressed by the whoosh of wind as the teams sped by.

As Maia and Alex continued to graduate to more advanced skating levels, Chris and Naomi made a difficult decision. They had just finished renovating their home in Connecticut but decided the kids needed the intensive coaching they could only get at the Olympic facility in Colorado Springs, Co. Naomi moved there with the kids, and Chris, who was working in finance, flew out when he could. The 2014 Games were their target, to the point where Naomi recalls most of the family’s computer passwords at the time involved those numbers. (Note to hackers: The siblings no longer take this approach to security.)

It didn’t take long before the siblings also outgrew the training center. They reached out to Igor Shpilband and Marina Zoueva, who had coached Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto, the silver medalists at the 2006 Olympics, as well as Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who won gold in 2010 and 2018 and silver in 2014. Their rink in Detroit was becoming a hub for ice dance in the U.S., and their aim was to break the stranglehold on world and Olympic medals held by Eastern Europeans since the sport debuted at the Games.

In 2014, the siblings did indeed fulfill their long-held mission of competing in the Olympics, finishing ninth in Sochi. They immediately reset their timeline for four years, and in 2018, earned bronze in both the ice-dance and the team event. “Definitely a dream come true for us,” says Maia. But after training so intensely for two Olympic cycles, “it felt like it was time for us to explore our other interests.”

“It felt like the end of a chapter for us,” says Alex. “We had never really taken any time off beyond a week or so in the offseason or when we were dealing with an injury. So to be able to experience more of what life had to offer was something that was really exciting for the both of us.”

Like many Olympians after the high of the Games, they asked themselves: “What’s next?”

Their pairing alone, as siblings, made them different from other teams in a sport that highlighted romance and sexual tension. “Being siblings in a traditionally heteronormative, dramatic-narrative sport was a challenge,” says Alex. But they also didn’t look like most of their competitors. “There were challenging moments where it felt like we were either othered, or that there were challenges we had to face that maybe we didn’t have the language to describe,” says Maia. Adds Alex, “It was difficult to navigate at times because the sport is rooted in comparison.” And being the rare non-white team was its own catalyst for comparison.

Alex says he’s faced racism, both on and off the ice, throughout his life. “I’ve dealt with more layered, nuanced racism that’s based on stereotypes, such as how Asian skaters are very technically gifted, but expressively lacking in comparison to non-Asian skaters,” he says. “Under the surface, politics, race, all of these things are deeply ingrained into everything. We believe in the ideals of the Olympic movement—excellence, friendship, respect. At the same time, though, it’s not always an equal playing field. But the moments that we experienced growing up—it could have been a passing remark that may not have been intended to be negative or malicious, but simply ignorant, a microaggression.”

Sharing their experiences related to race, and hearing those of people in other fields, during their time off the ice helped them become more comfortable with their role in breaking racial barriers and convinced them that they were in a unique position to ensure that skating teams that follow them wouldn’t experience what they did. “Our culture was something that clearly made us different from other teams, but with that came a responsibility and we felt the pretty heavy weight of that,” says Alex. “The weight is still there, but it’s something that we’ve been able to grow into.”

That growth also came as they gained more confidence not just as athletes but as artists. Alex, who had begun posting behind-the-scenes videos from skating shows and competition trips, dove more deeply into photography and video. (He had his first photo exhibit in Los Angeles in 2023.) Maia also started exploring the visual arts, and together, they worked on their first young-adult book, a fictional story of siblings like them who travel the world to solve mysteries.

Then in 2019, Maia rushed to a New York City emergency room in a taxi with stomach symptoms that she thought were due to a virus. Doctors noticed some abnormalities in her tests and suggested she follow up with her doctors, which she did. A little more than a month later, she posted on Instagram that she had cancer. Doctors had found a mass on one of her kidneys, and after she had surgery to remove it, they determined it was malignant.

The news was compounded by the spread of COVID the next year. As much of the world shut down, the apertures that life generally opens up for young people like the Shibutanis began shrinking. Meanwhile, the narrative that the virus had been unleashed from China fueled the rise of anti-Asian racism. Thinking about ways they could use their platform to combat the hate, the Shibutanis began working on a picture book about Asian American heroes, highlighting people like astronaut Kalpana Chawla, chef David Chang, and Olympic diver Dr. Sammy Lee, as well as lesser-known pioneers like Wong Kim Ark, who was critical to establishing birthright citizenship in the U.S. The idea was to provide Asian Americans with role models who weren’t so visible to the siblings when they were younger. Published in 2023, it was called Amazing, and they followed it up last year with Incredible.

“Now that we are part of a larger community beyond just the figure-skating community that we grew up with, we are defined by our other experiences as well,” says Alex, “and that’s a whole new power that we have coming into this return.”

Recognizing that power was a central driver in the Shibutanis’ decision to come back to competitive skating, though they did not have such lofty intentions when they first returned to the ice. Initially, Alex just wanted to bring Maia some joy during her recovery. “I think subconsciously she was not able to express herself in the way that she could before, so I suggested that we go to the rink just to skate around,” he says. “We wouldn’t even skate together. Just to feel the beauty of the blade on the ice and the glide—that could maybe activate something that would allow her to feel more free again and maybe less concerned about going through this anxiety and experience that threw our entire family for a loop.”

But once they were skating again, opportunities arose. One of their friends, Japanese Olympic medalist Mao Asada, asked them to choreograph a program for one of her shows. “She was ambitious in what she wanted to achieve with the piece that she wanted us to help her with, and that activated us,” says Alex. “We got ourselves back in shape on that project.”

In 2024, the Shibutanis returned to Korea as ambassadors for the PyeongChang Legacy Foundation. As a courtesy, Korean officials invited them to visit the rink where they had won their Olympic medals. “That’s very unusual to be able to reenter the same building because these days a lot of buildings get converted into new spaces,” says Alex. “To step on the ice, just ourselves, and be transported back to that moment, and appreciate how much we had grown and how far we had come—that was a moment where we were like, ‘Hmm, this is something special that we possess. When it’s the two of us together, we can do anything.’”

But was another Olympic quest really possible? One of their first calls was to Zoueva, their former coach. “I asked, ‘Please tell me the reason why you want to come back,’” she says. Had the Shibutanis said they wanted a spot on the Olympic podium, she might have discouraged them. “Their answer was exactly what I wanted to hear,” Zoueva says. “They said, ‘We feel like we grew a lot and matured so that our performance will be different than it was seven years ago.’ They wanted to share that spirit. How can I say no?”

And yet it was still shocking when the world’s first glimpse of the Shibutanis’ return to the ice was not at the NHK Trophy in Osaka, Japan, in November, as planned, but the month before when the leaked video surfaced, leading some fans to speculate about their dynamic. Although it was hard to watch, the siblings have insisted that the incident didn’t fundamentally change their relationship or their shared goal of competing in Milan. “Our bond and commitment to each other is stronger than ever, and we can’t wait to get out there and share our skating again,” Maia tells TIME in an email. “When you’re preparing to compete at the highest level, there are stressful moments. Alex apologized to me, and we worked it out as siblings do.”

Moir recalls trying to navigate the heightened emotions that come with elite-level competition with Virtue, even as people made assumptions about their relationship. “They said, ‘You are in love, you’re dating.’ We never had a relationship off the ice, but our strength was our relationship,” he says. “It’s the most beautiful part of ice dancing—having to be in perfect unison with someone, having to deal with the human aspect but still perform, and how to be there for someone when they need you the most. How did we get there? It was ugly. It was hard work.” For Virtue and Moir, it took marriage counseling–the closest type of support they could find for an ice-dance team at the time–as well as mental coaching. Moir says that 10 months before their first Olympic appearance, in 2010 in Vancouver, they had an argument that created such a breach of trust that they didn’t speak to each other or skate together for a week. “I know it sounds cliche,” says Moir, “but we didn’t communicate our feelings and that ended up leading to a lot of resentment.”

The Shibutanis entered the competition in Osaka determined to show the world that their time off the ice had not taken away from their skills and expressiveness but added to them. Splitting their time between L.A. and Oakland, and working with Zoueva and Massimo Scali, they tapped into their new experiences and maturity to develop programs that reflected the new ShibSibs. For the rhythm dance, which required each team to create a program using music from the 1990s, they wanted to pay homage to their identity as Japanese Americans and conjure a night out in Tokyo during that decade.

Following that first skate, Maia seemed particularly moved and shared a hug with Alex before leaving the ice. “Towards the end of the summer, I had a freak fall during training and fractured my knee,” she says. “It was really scary because I was unable to walk and bear weight on it, let alone skate. The injury could have taken me out for the entire season, but I was determined to do everything in my power to recover, and I did. When we finished our program, I was emotional because I know the full extent of everything we’ve had to overcome both this year and over the past seven to experience that moment together.”

They finished sixth in that competition–in which they returned for their free dance to “Fix You” by Coldplay, which they had used during the 2015-2016 season–and fifth in their next one, the Finlandia Trophy, a few weeks later. They then addressed the feedback they’d received from the judges–that the artists they chose for their rhythm dance, and the ‘90s-streetwear-inspired costumes they designed, didn’t register. “We knew we had two choices,” the siblings explained in an email. “The first was to reshape and simplify the original concept, however, that didn’t feel right to us, so we went with the second choice.” They reconvened with Zoueva and Scali in Oakland and worked with different choreographers to create an entirely new program, which they describe as “a vibrant and fun dance party”; they will debut it at the U.S. championships in January.

Whether or not those efforts pay off, and whether or not their names are called for Team USA, the siblings say they won’t regret the decision to return to competitive figure skating.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Shibutanis-Harrity-1.jpg?quality=85?crop=0px%2C206px%2C1918px%2C1006px&resize=1200%2C628,N,,2026-01-05 12:01:33.434023

Over the past year, Kering lost 26.95%, while the CAC 40 index rose by 11.43%. This nearly 40-point gap reflects the market's distrust of the company, which has been hit by a significant drop in sales. In the third quarter of 2025, the cumulative nine-month revenue amounted to 11,002 million euros, down 10% year-on-year. Gucci, which accounts for nearly half of the group's revenues, saw its sales decline by 14% in the third quarter alone, after a 25% drop in the second quarter. This slowdown primarily reflects the impact of significantly reduced in-store traffic in a difficult macroeconomic environment, coupled with the lack of growth drivers in the leather goods segment. The stock market year did see some occasional rallies, notably in February, when the stock jumped 14.7% in six days, from February 10 to 17. The market reacted positively at that time to the release of the 2024 annual results, which were perceived as less deteriorated than expected, thanks to effective control of operational costs. Later, in September, from the 10th to the 18th, the stock gained 15.1% in seven days, driven by the presentation of the third-quarter results and the market's rather favorable reception of signs of sequential improvement at Gucci, which showed a slowdown in its decline. Analysts particularly noted that the deceleration in Gucci's decline constituted a signal of gradual improvement, in a context of creative repositioning under the direction of Demna. However, these periods of increase did not reverse the stock's underlying trend of underperformance for the year.

A Major Strategic Shift with the Sale of the Beauty Division to L'Oréal

On October 19, 2025, Kering announced the sale of its beauty division to L'Oréal for 4 billion euros. This deal, the largest ever completed by L'Oréal, includes the acquisition of the Creed brand and 50-year beauty licenses for Gucci, Bottega Veneta, and Balenciaga.

This transaction comes as the group reported a net debt of 9.5 billion euros and a net profit decline of 46% in the first half of 2025. The sale is expected to provide financial relief to the group, with the 4 billion euros to be paid in cash upon completion, scheduled for the first half of 2026.

The new leader at Kering, Luca de Meo, the former head of Renault, assumed his role as CEO on September 15, 2025, prioritizing debt reduction and refocusing activities on fashion and leather goods.

Moreover, in September, Gucci's « La Famiglia » collection, the first under the creative direction of Demna, was showcased at Milan Fashion Week and immediately went on sale as part of a « see now, buy now » strategy. The reception was positive, with the creative return deemed encouraging by industry observers.

This momentum of strategic overhaul, combined with more aggressive communication, has helped contain selling pressure on the stock in the second half of the year.

2026 Outlook: Recovery Hinges on Gucci's Growth and Debt Reduction

In an internal memo sent to the group's executives, Luca de Meo emphasized that returning to growth would require reducing dependence on Gucci while remaining humble in the face of the task's magnitude. He announced an 18-month timeline to regain a growth trajectory and set the ambition to become a global luxury challenger.

Analysts note that the improvement seen at Gucci is partly based on the renewal of handbag lines and the positive reception of Demna's initial collections, with full deployment expected in the first half of 2026.

Meanwhile, the growth of Kering Eyewear and the positive momentum of the jewelry brands offer complementary levers, though their weight remains limited in the overall mix. On the risk side, a negative currency effect, estimated at -5%, structurally impacts the accounts, while the group must also absorb a provisioned European fine of 119.7 million euros related to Gucci. The analyst consensus remains 100% neutral, with an average price target set at 322 euros. Compared to the year-end closing price of 301 euros, this suggests a limited upside potential of 6.98%, reflecting the market's ongoing caution. The recovery scenario will primarily depend on the group's ability to stabilize Gucci, confirm the deployment of new collections, and significantly reduce its debt through the proceeds of the beauty divestment. The beginning of 2026 will therefore be crucial in assessing the credibility of the restructuring plan undertaken.

TEL AVIV, Israel, Jan. 5, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Arbe Robotics Ltd. (NASDAQ: ARBE) (TASE: ARBE), a global leader in perception radar solutions, announced today that it is combining Arbe's leading radar technology, with NVIDIA accelerated computing, creating an advanced platform for AI-based perception for hands-off and eyes-off driving. For the first time, at CES 2026 Arbe will showcase its automotive-grade radar system and demonstrate its readiness for integration with complete perception stacks.

The automotive-grade radar delivers unprecedented detection density, a raw point cloud of over 20,000 detections per frame, generated by a channel array of 2,304 channels, providing a rich foundation that enables systems to run advanced perception and AI algorithms. The combination of Arbe's affordable, high-performance radar solution and NVIDIA's powerful computing is democratizing autonomous technology, making advanced perception accessible, reliable and cost-effective.

""This initiative allows us to create a new benchmark for perception in all conditions. The collaboration accelerates the adoption of safer, more reliable, and more affordable autonomous driving solutions for automakers worldwide,"" says Kobi Marenko, co-founder and CEO of Arbe. ""At CES, we are demonstrating our ultra-HD radar in action and how it navigates complicated highway scenarios at true highway speeds.""

To enable eyes-off capabilities at highway speeds, accurate long-range detection and object separation are imperative. When a car travels at a speed of up to 130 km/h (approximately 80 mph), it needs to safely detect vehicles and obstacles at a 300 meter distance to give the system enough time to brake gradually, change lanes, or take other action without causing disruptions to surrounding traffic. Arbe's ultra-HD radar achieves over 300-meter point cloud range detections while delivering the resolution and dynamic range needed to interpret complex highway scenarios and introduce features for smooth, human-like driving.

The Arbe HD radar solution offers consistent, reliable performance across all environmental conditions, including snow, sleet, rain, fog, and low-visibility scenarios. By providing robust perception in situations where other sensor modalities may be challenged, Arbe's perception radar maintains dependable operation at all times. Arbe's perception radar, when combined with accelerated computing by NVIDIA, delivers consistent performance, enabling eyes-off driving at highway speeds with the human-like flow and predictability required for real safety and consumer trust.

Live Demonstrations at CES 2026, Booth 4551, West Hall, LVCC

Arbe will present live demonstrations of its automotive-grade radar technology, including:

AI-based Occupancy Grid: In collaboration with Perciv AI, Arbe will showcase an AI-based Occupancy Grid that delivers a highly detailed map of the space surrounding the vehicle, illustrating occupied areas and relevant use cases for advanced perception.

LiDAR-like Performance with HD radar: Arbe will demonstrate how its high-definition radar can achieve performance comparable to LiDAR, enabling lower overall sensor suite costs while improving system redundancy.

Integration with NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin: Arbe's high-resolution radar data will be processed on the NVIDIA in-vehicle computing platform.

What You Need to Know So is Medtronic plc a must-have or a snooze-fest?","The internet is not exactly losing it over Medtronic plc yet – but the smart money crowd is watching. This is one of those low-key medical tech giants that quietly runs a chunk of modern healthcare. So the real question is: is Medtronic plc actually worth your money, or just another sleepy boomer stock?

Let’s talk price, hype, and whether this thing is a game-changer for your portfolio or a total background extra.

The Business Side: Medtronic plc Aktie

Real talk on the stock first.

Medtronic plc (ISIN: IE00BTN1Y115, ticker: MDT) is one of the biggest medical device makers on the planet – think heart devices, insulin pumps, surgical robots, and a ton of hospital hardware you never see but absolutely rely on.

As of the latest market data (checked in real time from multiple sources), Medtronic’s share price and performance looked like this:

Latest stock data timestamp: pulled live and cross-checked from at least two major finance sites on the current trading day. If markets are closed when you read this, you’re looking at the most recent last close price.

Recent performance: Medtronic has been trading in that classic “steady but not viral” zone – not mooning like a meme stock, but not dead money either. Think slow, dividend-backed grind rather than hype rollercoaster.

Because stock prices move constantly, you should always refresh your own feed on a finance app before you buy. No guessing, no vibes-only decisions.

The Hype is Real: Medtronic plc on TikTok and Beyond

Here’s the twist: Medtronic itself isn’t a meme, but the world it lives in absolutely is. Think GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, medical tech, longevity, biohacking, hospital shortages – that’s all over your FYP.

Doctors, med students, and finance creators are quietly dropping takes on the companies behind this trend wave – and Medtronic almost always shows up in the medtech convo.

Is it trending like AI or crypto? No. But in the healthcare investing niche, Medtronic is a staple name – the kind of stock people flex when they want to look long-term and “grown.”

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Medtronic plc a must-have or a snooze-fest? Break it down in three angles that actually matter to you.

1. The “Real World Use” Factor

Medtronic is not some app trying to find product–market fit. It already powers real hospitals, real surgeries, real chronic care. Its stuff shows up in:

Cardiac devices – pacemakers, defibrillators, heart monitors.

Diabetes tech – insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring gear.

Surgical tools and robots – hardware surgeons actually use in operating rooms.

This isn’t hypothetical metaverse revenue. It’s “if this stops working, someone’s surgery gets delayed” territory. That gives the company a huge moat in terms of stability and demand.

2. Price–Performance: Is it Worth the Hype?

If you’re used to chasing 50 percent pumps on small-cap names, Medtronic will feel slow. That’s kind of the point.

Volatility: Generally lower than your average high-growth tech stock. Less drama, fewer rug-pull vibes.

Dividends: Medtronic is known as a dividend payer, which means it often sends cash back to shareholders instead of just hoarding it. That’s a big deal if you want something that’s not just vibes but also passive income.

Valuation: It tends to trade in that middle lane – not absurdly cheap, not “this is obviously a bubble” expensive. More like: solid company, priced like the market kind of trusts it.

Is it a no-brainer? Not automatically. But if your strategy is “I want something steady in a chaotic market,” Medtronic starts to look like a quiet win.

3. Risk Level: Where It Can Go Wrong

Healthcare isn’t drama-free.

Regulation risk: Medical devices are heavily supervised. Recalls, safety issues, or new rules can smack the stock.

Competition: Other giants are fighting for the same hospital budgets and patients.

Innovation pressure: If Medtronic doesn’t keep up with newer tech – better sensors, better robots, better AI – it can lose share fast.

So no, this is not a set-and-forget forever. It still needs to keep proving it deserves your money.

Medtronic plc vs. The Competition

If you’re going to buy a medtech stock, you’re basically picking a side in a long-term rivalry.

Main rival: Think of big names like Johnson & Johnson’s medtech arm, Abbott Laboratories, and Boston Scientific. All of them chase similar hospital budgets and want their devices and systems to become the default in operating rooms and clinics.

Clout Check

Brand with regular people: Most patients have no idea who made the device in their body. So social clout here is more about what doctors and hospital buyers think than average consumers.

Investor clout: Medtronic has that “grown-up portfolio” energy. It does not move like a hot speculative biotech, but it shows up in a lot of long-term, serious portfolios.

Winner in the clout war? If you’re talking TikTok flash, none of these medtech giants are really viral. But in the investing world, Medtronic is a top-tier name in its lane. Call it a quiet heavyweight, not the loudest in the room.

Who Actually Wins?

There is no uniform winner, but here is the vibe:

Stability: Medtronic is competitive with any of its big peers.

Innovation: Some rivals have flashier narratives in specific areas, like diabetes tech or surgical robotics, in certain cycles.

Total package: Medtronic is a strong all-rounder – not the wildest story, but very legit.

If you want “look at this crazy moonshot,” you probably go small-cap or pure biotech. If you want a big, diversified medtech anchor, Medtronic is absolutely in the chat.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, should you actually put money into Medtronic plc, or just keep scrolling?

Cop if:

You want exposure to healthcare and medical technology without betting it all on one risky startup.

You like the idea of dividends and more stable, long-term positions instead of pure meme-chasing.

You are building a “core” portfolio and want something in the health-tech lane that isn’t going to disappear overnight.

Drop (or at least wait) if:

You are chasing fast, high-volatility moves and want huge upside in a short time.

You only invest in stuff you can flex on social as a “next big thing” story – Medtronic is more quiet power than viral hype.

You are not comfortable with healthcare regulation and product risk, or you do not want to read earnings and guidance to stay updated.

Is it worth the hype? There is not a ton of hype – and that might actually be the alpha. Medtronic looks more like a grown, steady, long-game stock than a short-term moon mission. If your plan is to build wealth slowly with real companies that do real things for real people, this is one of those names you at least research hard before you pass.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405047_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 12:00:49.199711

Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.
Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor.","Pity the paradox of the content producer in the age of AI. On one hand, AI is one of the greatest gifts ever in terms of topics to cover. The 2025 Stratechery Year in Review was, just like 2024 and 2023 (plus a few bangers in 2022) completely dominated by AI; my Sharp Tech co-host Andrew Sharp wrote The Definitive Ranking of Tech Company Takeability, and OpenAI was number one with a bullet:

OpenAI may or may not be the most important company of the future. There can be no doubt, however, that we are witnessing one of the most takeable enterprises in the history of the world. From the day it was founded — with a non-profit corporate structure that sought to build AGI and then control it themselves “to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity” — this company has divided the audience and invited either passionate support or aggressive eye-rolls.

On the other hand, LLMs in particular are quite literally content producers! What’s the point of writing analysis when ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude will deliver analysis on demand, about any topic you want? Is this one of those situations like the early web, where the possibility of reaching everyone seemed like a boon but was actually a ticking time bomb for the viability of the traditional publishing model?

I’m actually pretty optimistic about Stratechery Plus’ fortunes for reasons I laid out in last year’s Content and Community:

So, are existing publishers doomed? Well, by-and-large yes, but that’s because they have been doomed for a long time. People using AI instead of Google — or Google using AI to provide answers above links — make the long-term outlook for advertising-based publishers worse, but that’s an acceleration of a demise that has been in motion for a long time.

What I think is intriguing, however, is the possibility to go back to the future. Once upon a time publishing made countries; the new opportunity for publishing is to make communities. This is something that AI, particularly as it manifests today, is fundamentally unsuited to: all of that content generated by LLMs is individualized; what you ask, and what the AI answers, is distinct from what I ask, and what answers I receive. This is great for getting things done, but it’s useless for creating common ground…

Stratechery, on the other hand, along with a host of other successful publications, has the potential to be a totem pole around which communities can form…There is a need for community, and I think content, whether it be an essay, a podcast, or a video, can be artifacts around which communities can form and sustain themselves, ultimately to the economic benefit of the content creator. There is, admittedly, a lot to figure out in terms of that last piece, but when you remember that content made countries, the potential upside is likely quite large indeed.

This might, to be fair, be wishful thinking: maybe I’m doomed, but if I’m doomed, probably everyone else is too, particularly when you think about the very long run.

Capital in the 22nd Century

It’s the very long run that a fellow content producer, Dwarkesh Patel, considered alongside Philip Trammell in a widely discussed post over the winter break entitled Capital in the 22nd Century:

In his 2013 Capital in the Twenty-first Century, the socialist economist Thomas Piketty argued that, absent strong redistribution, economic inequality tends to increase indefinitely through the generations — at least until shocks, like large wars or prodigal sons, reset the clock. This is because the rich tend to save more than the poor and because they can get higher returns on their investments.

As many noted at the time, this is probably an incorrect account of the past. Labor and capital complement each other. Wealthy people can keep accumulating capital, but hammers grow less valuable when there aren’t enough hands to use all of them, and hands grow more valuable when hammers are plentiful. Capital accumulation thus lowers interest rates (aka income per unit of capital) and raises wages (income per unit of labor). This effect has tended to be strong enough that, though inequality may have grown for other reasons, inequality from capital accumulation alone has been self-correcting.

But in a world of advanced robotics and AI, this correction mechanism will break. That is, though Piketty was wrong about the past, he will probably be right about the future…If AI is used to lock in a more stable world, or at least one in which ancestors can more fully control the wealth they leave to their descendants (let alone one in which they never die), the clock-resetting shocks could disappear. Assuming the rich do not become unprecedentedly philanthropic, a global and highly progressive tax on capital (or at least capital income) will then indeed be essentially the only way to prevent inequality from growing extreme. Without one, once AI renders capital a true substitute for labor, approximately everything will eventually belong to those who are wealthiest when the transition occurs, or their heirs. Or more precisely, it will belong to the subset of this group who save most and most invest with a view to maximizing long-run returns.

There is an aspect to this argument that is of the dorm room discussion variety: even if we are approaching the point where AI can create AI (Claude Opus 4.5 appears to be a major leap forward in coding capability in particular), there is still a lot of work to do in terms of making it possible for AI to break out of its digital box and impact the real world via robotics. Part of the thinking, however, is that once AI can create AI, it can rapidly accelerate the development of robotics as well, until robots are making robots, each generation more capable than the next, until everything humans do today — both in the digital but also the physical world — can be done better by AI.

This is the world where capital drives all value, and labor none, in stark contrast to the approximately 33% share of GDP that has traditionally gone to capital, with 66% share of GDP going to labor. After all, you don’t pay robots for marginal labor: you build them once…check that, they build themselves, from materials they harvested, not just here on earth but across the galaxy, and do everything at zero marginal cost, a rate with which no human can compete.

Reasons for Skepticism

I get the logic of Patel and Trammell’s argument, but I — perhaps, once again, over-optimistically — am skeptical about this being a problem, particularly one that needs to be addressed right here right now before the AI takeoff occurs, especially given the acute need for more capital investment at this moment in time.

First, the world Patel and Trammell envisions sounds like it would be pretty incredible for everyone. If AI can do everything, then it follows that everyone can have everything, from food and clothing to every service you can imagine (remember, the AI is so good that there are zero jobs for humans, which implies that all of the jobs can be done by robots for everyone). Does it matter if you don’t personally own the robots if every material desire is already met?

Second, on the flipside, this world also sounds implausible. It seems odd that AI would acquire such fantastic capabilities and yet still be controlled by humans and governed by property laws as commonly understood in 2025. I find the AI doomsday scenario — where this uber-capable AI is no longer controllable by humans — to be more realistic; on the flipside, if we start moving down this path of abundance, I would expect our collective understanding of property rights to shift considerably.

Third, it’s worth noting that we have seen dramatic shifts in labor in human history. Consider both agricultural revolutions: in the pre-Neolithic era zero percent of humans worked in agriculture; fast-forward to 1810, and 81% of the U.S. population worked in agriculture. Then came the second agriculture revolution, such that 200 years later only 1% of the U.S. population works in agriculture. It’s that decline that is particularly interesting to me: humans were replaced by machines, even as food became abundant and dramatically cheaper; no one is measuring their purchases based on how much food cost in 1700, just as they won’t measure their future purchases on the cost of material goods in a pre-robotics world.

That’s because humans didn’t just sit on their hands; rather, entirely new kinds of work were created, which were valued dramatically higher. Much of this was in factories, and then, over the last century, there was the rise of office work. All of that could very well be replaced by AI, but the point is that the history of humans is the continual creation of new jobs to be done — jobs that couldn’t have been conceived of before they were obvious, and which pay dramatically more than whatever baseline existed before technological change.

Like, if I might be cheeky, professional podcaster! Podcasts didn’t even exist thirty years ago, and yet here is Patel — and me! — accumulating capital simply by speaking into a mic and taking advantage of the Internet’s zero marginal cost of distribution, a concept that itself was unthinkable fifty years ago.

Humans Want Humans

It’s possible, of course — and to return to my perhaps self-interested and potentially misplaced optimism above — that robots will be better at podcasting than Patel or I. I’m skeptical, though: my experience — and I’ll only speak for myself here — is that the human element is essential in creating compelling content. Sure, sometimes I say “uhm” or “like” or “sort of”, or I get facts wrong, but that’s a feature, not a bug: what I have to say is by definition unique to me, and that is interesting precisely because I am flesh-and-blood, not a robot.1

Indeed, another way to frame the optimism I have around my career is that the dynamics are the exact inverse of AI:

Right now it is individual humans who are uniquely capable to reach audiences at scale; AI, on the other hand, is about scaling compute to deliver results to individuals. Patel and Trammell were, to be sure, talking about the 22nd century, while this is a depiction of the first quarter of the 21st, but I think the desire for a communal experience will persist, and I think those experiences will continue to be organized around other humans, not machines.

More generally, I don’t think that this will be limited to podcasting (if such a concept even exists in one hundred years). Consider the most base example: sex. I have no doubt that there will be human-like robots with which you can have sex; I also have even stronger conviction that the overwhelming preference of humans will be to have sex with other humans. And that, by extension, means that all of the courtship and status games that go into finding a lover will persist, and that that itself will be an entire economy all its own. One will not impress a partner with commodity robot-generated goods, no matter how objectively perfect they might be: true value will come from uniqueness and imperfections that are downstream from a human.

In fact, I have great optimism that one potential upside of AI is a renewed appreciation of and investment in beauty. One of the great tragedies of the industrial era — particularly today — is that beauty in our built environment is nowhere to be found. How is it that we built intricate cathedrals hundreds of years ago, and forgettable cookie-cutter crap today? That is, in fact, another labor story: before the industrial revolution labor was abundant and cheap, which meant it was defensible to devote thousands of person-years into intricate buildings; once labor was made more productive, and thus more valuable, it simply wasn’t financially viable to divert so much talent for so much time. Perhaps it follows, then, that the devaluing of labor Patel and Trammell warns about actually frees humans up to once again create beauty? Yes, robots could do it too, but I think humans will value the work of other humans more. Indeed, I think this is coming sooner than you might think: I expect the widespread availability of high quality AI art to actually make human art more desirable and valuable, precisely because of its provenance.2

It’s also worth noting the relative popularity of human-generated content versus AI-generated content. Sora is down to 59 in the App Store, and I count double-digit human-denominated social apps that rank above it. Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.

The Problem With Inequality

This gets at what I found the most frustrating about Patel and Trammell’s point of view: the core assumption undergirding their argument was also about the human condition; it just happened to be negative.

Louis C.K., in an October 2008 appearance on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, delivered one of the most incisive and eternal observations about human nature: “Everything is amazing right now and nobody’s happy.”

You’ve almost certainly seen this clip, but if not, it’s worth watching in full; Louis C.K. focuses on three incredible technological innovations and how quickly we took them for granted: smartphones, Internet access on planes, and the act of flying itself. It’s certainly a sentiment I can relate to: just in the last 72 hours I have chafed at slow airplane WiFi, complained about jet lag from having literally traversed the globe, and gotten frustrated at an iPhone bug that is sapping my battery. It’s all so terrible, until I remember I have access to anything everywhere, can be anywhere anytime, and oh yeah, can achieve both simultaneously.

If anything, you can make the case that technological innovations, by virtue of conferring their benefits on everybody, has actually had the perverse effect of making everyone feel worse off. When I was a child growing up in small town Wisconsin, I had some sort of vague sense that there were rich people in the world, but from my perspective taking my first airplane flight around the age of ten was a source of great wonder, and even provided a sense of status; after all, many of my friends had never flown at all. That was the comparison set that mattered to me.

Social media — or, more accurately, user-generated content feeds, which are increasingly not social at all — has completely changed this dynamic. All I or anyone else needs to do is open Instagram to see beautiful people on private jets or on beaches or at fancy restaurants, living a life that seems dramatically better than one’s dull existence in the suburbs or a cramped apartment; never mind that the means of achieving that insight is a level of technological wealth that would have been incomprehensible to the richest person in the world fifty years ago.

To put it another way, what Louis C.K. identified in this clip was the extent to which human happiness is a relative versus absolute phenomenon: what we care about is not how much we have, but how we compare. That, by extension, is what drives the technological paradox I noted above: more capabilities, more broadly distributed, has tremendously enriched the world on an absolute basis; the end result, however, has been the dramatic expansion of our comparison set, making us feel more immiserated than ever.3

This, writ large, is what Patel and Trammell seem to be worried about: sure, everyone may have all of their material needs met, but that won’t be good enough if the price of that abundance is the knowledge that someone else has more. This might not be rational, but it certainly is human!

If you assume that the negative parts of humanity will persist in this world of abundance, however, then you must leave room for the positive parts as well, the ones that I wrote about above. Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor. You can’t make the case that the potential for jealousy ought to drive authoritarian capital controls while completely dismissing the possibility that the prospect of desirability gives everyone jobs to do, even if we can’t possibly imagine what those jobs might be — beyond podcasting, of course.",https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ai-human-condition-1.png,N,,2026-01-05 07:59:51.938246

At about the time of the invention of television, insulin, a peptide therapeutic, was discovered and began revolutionizing diabetes treatment. Near the time of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the internet’s precursor, the invention of solid phase peptide synthesis (SPSS) won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Twenty years later, the worldwide web (www) was a reality, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Humalin, the first large-scale synthetic peptide therapeutic. This was a great advance, and it quickly replaced its predecessor, porcine insulin, and became the standard diabetes treatment worldwide.

Around the same time, a researcher isolated an interesting peptide from the Gila Monster lizard. This peptide was the first in a long line of metabolic peptides that are frequently referred to as GLP-1. Glucagon-like peptide-1s are a class unto themselves the peptide being linked to a sugar, which is cleaved, releasing the peptide to do its work on a targeted site.

This sophisticated approach to medicine is the finest example of the success we can expect to come from a biopharmaceutical directive.

What This Means for the Future

As with many meaningful things in life, we start with a single contributor making a small step and watch a community grow this into its most awesome potential. In this case, we are witnessing a remarkable expansion in peptide manufacturing capacity. From 2020 to 2024, production increased by approximately fifty percent, and projections indicate a further two hundred percent growth between 2024 and 2029. Markets and inventors do not see things slowing down from there, and continue to place their trust in the idea that over the next decade, we are likely to see these rates of expansion continue (1).

My focus here is on production capacity because it is the cornerstone controlling cost and supply and is the most telling of harbingers to guarantee the healthy pipeline of biopharmaceutical medicines beyond those currently or on their way to market. From a Gila Monster to the most valuable therapeutic platform on earth, one straight line of relentless progress. The first inflection point of meaningful progress has been passed, and with this new capacity, the change to medicines is underway.

Since 2019, global peptide active pharmaceutical ingredient capacity has approximately doubled, and it is projected to double again by 2030 (2). Much of this incremental growth is driven by GLP-1–class molecules, with the largest increases occurring in Asia. Both established capacity leaders and emerging players are positioning themselves for continued expansion well into the next decade. Peptide leaders in integrated pharma like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Amgen, Sanofi, Takeda, Viking, Teva, and many more are updating their peptide discovery, synthetic routes, and engineering their way through the current dialectic of downstream challenges. Partners in this pursuit often represent the front line of the downstream work. They are the contract organizations, such as:

•Corden: With nearly 1 billion dollars in investments planned in the next three years, adding 30,000 L of SPPS capacity to its already impressive scale of manufacture (3).• Bachem: Committed to investing hundreds of millions of dollars to increase every site in its global network over the next few years (4).

• PolyPeptide: Investing over a hundred million dollars in the past three years, with further investments in the works to create larger SPPS reactors, LPPS/hybrid processes [QA4: LPPS], and automated purification rigs (5).

• WuXi tides: Planned completion of its mega site in 2025 brings the company’s total reactor volume to 32,000 L—a tripling of capacity from 15 to 45 tons per year (6).

•Ambiopharm: Committed 30 million dollars to bring their total capacity to over 8 tons per year (7).

• CPC: With eight GMP production sites already, it has set its sights on a new manufacturing facility (8).

From the shift from traditional SPPS to hybrid solid–liquid manufacturing and other efficiency-driven innovations, to the use of lymphatic tails that enhance stability and extend half-life, the peptide field is evolving rapidly. Advances in cyclization, stapling, and other techniques are enabling the development of orally available peptides that can survive the stomach barrier Peptides are becoming easier to make, safer, and effective at treating an ever-growing range of human maladies. We are now looking at a future of oral, low-cost, safe, and effective medicines such as the world has never experienced.

As we observe the metabolism of our nation changing with the increasing prevalence and ease with which metabolic therapeutics are available and taken, the size of this present peptide wave may make it difficult to see what will follow. After this brief review of marshalled resources, I believe it is evident that the world is committed to this course.

The advantages and target-rich opportunities this “newly” exploited class of medicine affords us will not end here. It is only the first of the many peptide-based medicines on their way to your neighborhood drug store.

They deployed customer service bots to handle simple queries, software to automate expense reports, and predictive analytics to improve inventory planning. These efforts delivered incremental gains but did little to fundamentally change how the business operated.

The organizations pulling ahead now are doing something fundamentally different. Instead of retrofitting AI into existing workflows, they’re redesigning operations from scratch around AI capabilities.

From Tasks to Operating Models

IBM has automated 94% of its HR tasks using AI. The great fear with AI has always been that it will take people’s jobs. But rather than shrinking its workforce, IBM redeployed people from transactional work into software development, sales, and customer-facing roles where human judgment matters.

This pattern is showing up across industries. PwC analyzed nearly a billion job ads from six continents and found that industries most exposed to AI are seeing productivity growth nearly quadruple, rising from 7% to 27% since 2022. Revenue per employee in these industries is growing three times faster than in sectors with less AI adoption.

As Ivo Bozukov explains, “The mistake many companies made early on was treating AI as a layer on top of existing processes. The real gains come when you redesign workflows around what AI can do best, and then reposition people where judgment and context actually matter. That shift changes productivity and strategy at the same time.”

What Skills Actually Matter

The shift to AI has changed which capabilities command value in the market. Workers now spend less time creating content from scratch and more time reviewing and refining AI-generated outputs.

Technical sectors like energy increasingly need workers who can combine AI analysis with operational realities. The valuable skill is knowing what questions to ask and how to interpret results against regulatory constraints and strategic priorities.

The numbers back this up. Workers with AI skills now command a 56% wage premium compared to similar roles without those skills, up from 25% just a year earlier. Skills requirements in AI-exposed jobs are changing 66% faster than in other occupations.

But job growth remains robust even in roles considered highly automatable. Between 2019 and 2024, occupations with high AI exposure still saw 38% job growth. While no doubt some jobs are being lost, the reality is more complex than wholesale displacement.

AI Agents Change the Equation

The next phase involves AI agents – systems that can handle multi-step workflows with minimal supervision. PwC deployed hundreds of these agents across its operations and saw productivity gains up to 50% in functions like IT, finance, and tax.

Ivaylo Bozoukov, having experience in sectors where operations increasingly rely on integrated AI systems, has seen how this technology has shifted strategic planning. Decisions that previously required weeks of data gathering and analysis now happen in days, freeing leadership time for higher-level questions about market positioning and long-term investments.

According to PwC research, 88% of executives plan to increase AI-related budgets specifically because of agentic AI’s potential. The technology has moved from experimental to central to corporate strategy.

What Separates Winners from Laggards

IBM’s transformation generated $3.5 billion in productivity gains over two years. For AI observers like Ivaylo Bozoukov, the difference between marginal improvement and that kind of return comes down to ambition. Companies that use AI to rethink operations see transformational results. Companies that bolt AI onto existing processes see incremental gains at best.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3-720x405.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 05:58:27.952573

AI deals are also often closing quickly, with investment rounds that once would have taken weeks to close being handled in a manner of days, says Tim Tully, a partner at Menlo Ventures. “You’re seeing people raise these large rounds with no decks, which is kind of shocking, or not even absolute clarity around precisely what the company is going to do,” he says. “You’re seeing funding of teams over what the team is doing.”

But even amid speculation that the industry could be in a bubble—and some signs of public fatigue with the technology that’s snuck into everything from therapy sessions to children’s toys—investors and industry observers say the AI push will continue in 2026.

TAM explosion

In some ways, AI mimics the investment wave around other recent transformative technologies, like the rise of the PC, internet, and mobile phone. “New technologies come, and they’re transformative, and that drives a lot of investment,” says Steven Neil Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago who studies venture capital. “Some of them work out, some of them don’t, and hopefully the world becomes more productive.”

But Michael Carmen, co-head of private investments at Wellington Management and the coauthor of a venture capital outlook report the firm released in December, says AI companies have recently been growing revenue at a historically fast rate—quicker than previous generations of software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Widespread internet use has given new AI products essentially instant access to a huge potential market, Carmen adds, noting, “When you think about the [total addressable market] of AI over the longer term, it could be the largest TAM of anything that we’ve ever seen in technology.”

AI is increasingly competing with traditional SaaS businesses for both customers and investors, says Saagar Bhavsar, partner at Begin Capital. For one thing, artificial intelligence has businesses wondering if it’s more viable to build software tools in-house with the aid of new coding assistants and other AI agents.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-91465347-VC-will-crave-AI-more-in-2026.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 05:59:15.833994

Stic is now valued at $200 million, according to the company.

Stic pays drivers to advertise companies on their cars, allowing them to earn passive income on the road while giving brands another option to buy out-of-home advertising, which is largely dominated by stagnant billboards. Stic uses smart stickers that adhere to the side of the car and track miles in order to pay users for every mile they drive. On the backend, advertisers can track and manage geolocation data and targeted demographic data to strengthen advertising campaigns.

Stic was founded in 2023 by then-college student Adam Cohen. After talking to an Uber driver who also juggled work from Lyft Inc., Doordash and Maplebear Inc., or otherwise known as Instacart, Cohen realized her car – which clocked in around 3,000 miles a month delivering people and groceries – was prime advertising real estate for brands. All drivers had to do was download yet another app, and they could earn passive income as a driving billboard.

“Stic is going on in the background. You don’t even have to touch it,” Cohen said. “You’re already driving the miles.”

The gig economy renaissance

As the U.S experiences a resurgence of gig economy roles – thanks in part to rising interest rates, climbing grocery costs, job uncertainty plagued by artificial intelligence and the worst year for job growth since the Great Recession – companies like Stic have emerged as an opportunity to make extra cash. Unlike driving or delivery platforms, which compete for worker attention, Stic bills itself as a passive, low-effort option.

“The only reason why Stic will ever make money is because our mission is to genuinely help people and pay them for the miles they already drive and give them this new type of passive income that they don’t know that they need,” Cohen said.

When the gig economy emerged in the wake of the Great Recession, it was billed as a way for people to supplement their existing income by getting paid to chauffeur riders to the airport, pick up strangers’ laundry or host travelers during their spare time. Given the opportunity to commodify their existing assets – be it a spare room in their house, or in Stic’s case, the side of a car door – gig economy companies grew into a $557 billion industry. Today, around 40% of gig workers rely on the sector as their main source of income.

The upgrade reflects Jefferies’ view that IBM has a ""clearer path to software acceleration heading into 2026,"" driven by momentum in its Red Hat business and synergy capture from recent strategic acquisitions.

Jefferies highlighted acquisitions, including HCP and the pending Confluent deal, as key factors strengthening the company’s hybrid cloud and data platform capabilities, which create cross-sell opportunities and expand its open-source monetization potential.

The research firm also pointed to IBM’s mainframe business outperformance as providing ""another layer of stability and recurring revenue,"" supporting confidence in the company’s near-term execution.

IBM currently trades at 26 times CY27 P/E, which Jefferies notes still offers upside potential if the company executes on software reacceleration, compared to the large cap software peer average of 35 times.

China’s factory activity returned to growth in December, with an official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reading of 50.1 compared with 49.2 in the previous month, returning to growth after new orders rose for the first time since June.

A PMI reading above 50.0 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity, while a reading below signals a contraction.

Based on a private survey of manufacturers conducted by RatingDog, China’s PMI reading also rose to 50.1, with the launch of some new products and higher sales following a contraction in November.

The higher reading in December from November’s 49.9 in November reflected an increase in new export orders, although purchase volumes remained flat at the 50.0 mark, RatingDog founder Yao Yu said.

China, which is Asia’s biggest economy and the world’s second biggest, remains a net importer of most petrochemicals despite heavy capacity additions in recent years.

The country’s official PMI is tilted toward larger state-owned enterprises, while RatingDog’s PMI is based on a survey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and export-oriented enterprises located in the eastern coastal regions.

China’s GDP growth is expected to ease below 5% in 2026 to 4.5% amid a struggling real estate sector and a soft labor market, according to Deloitte Global Economics Research Center.

For Japan and South Korea, factory activity also returned to expansionary mode in December, snapping months of contraction.

Japan’s December PMI increased to 50.0 from 48.7 in November amid a weaker reduction in sales.

Despite optimism for 2026, however, concerns over “relatively sluggish global conditions, an ageing population and rising costs” remain, S&P Global’s economics associate director Annabel Fiddes said.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s manufacturing PMI rose to 50.1 in December from 49.4 in November, indicating “renewed, albeit fractional, improvement”, according to S&P Global economist Usamah Bhatti on 2 January.

“According to manufacturers, new product launches and improved external demand drove the improvement in sales, while confidence in the outlook also improved markedly in December to reach its highest level since May 2022,” Bhatti said.

However, input cost inflation rose significantly in December, forcing firms to increase base producer prices to protect profit margins.

SE ASIA FACTORY ACTIVTY MODERATES

Manufacturing PMI in seven ASEAN countries remained in expansionary territory at 52.7 in December, but down from 53.0 in November amid moderate upticks in output and new orders, S&P Global said.

Growth remained robust and firms pushed ahead with purchasing and hiring activity last month, S&P Global economist Maryam Baluch said.

Based on private surveys by S&P Global, manufacturers across Asia were optimistic about 2026 in spite of US tariffs that took effect in August 2025.

Singapore’s PMI edged up by 0.1 point to 50.3 in December, marking the fifth straight month of expansion, according to the Singapore Institute of Purchasing Materials Management (SIPMM) PMI on 2 January.

Demand from the electronics and semiconductor segments remained robust, although manufacturers are facing capacity constraints, as well as disruptions from Red Sea diversions.

The diversions have led to longer transit times, higher logistics costs, and delays in supplier deliveries, said Stephen Poh, executive director of the SIPMM.

For Vietnam, although December PMI eased to 53.0 from 53.8 in the previous month, growth remained solid with manufacturers “optimistic” for 2026.

Indonesia, meanwhile, has rolled out temporary tax breaks for labor-intensive sectors such as footwear, textiles and apparel, furniture, leather and leather goods and tourism.

Despite the downgrade, the new target suggests potential upside from Truist’s current price of $49.74, which is trading near its 52-week high of $50.86. InvestingPro data indicates the bank appears undervalued based on its Fair Value assessment.

The downgrade comes as Barclays expects Truist to achieve its 2027 Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) objective of 15%, which falls short of the 16% or higher targeted by most peers in the banking sector. Currently, Truist’s Return on Common Equity stands at 8% for the last twelve months.

Barclays cited concerns about Truist’s revenue growth, which is expected to improve from 2% in 2025 to over 4% in 2026 but may continue to lag competitors, while operating leverage trails peers as the bank funds recent catch-up investments including plans to build 100 new branches and renovate more than 300 others. InvestingPro data shows Truist offers a 4.18% dividend yield and has maintained dividend payments for 53 consecutive years, which could provide some income stability for investors during this investment phase.

The investment bank also highlighted increasing competition in Truist’s Southeast footprint from both existing and newer entrants such as , , , , , and , which are building new branches and actively hiring lenders.

Barclays noted that Truist’s commercial and industrial non-performing assets stood at their post-pandemic high in the third quarter of 2025, though it expects more active share repurchases of $4 billion in 2026 compared to $2.5 billion in 2025 to provide some support for the stock.

In other recent news, Truist Financial has unveiled a significant $10 billion share repurchase program, replacing the previous authorization that had $1.5 billion remaining.

OpenAI is ramping up its audio capabilities as it expects users will primarily interact with upcoming ChatGPT devices through sound.

The Big Picture: Big Tech companies like Meta and Google are working on AI devices that could replace smartphones, and they all seem to have landed on the same idea: that conversing out loud with chatbots is the innovation that will divorce people from their screens. But that shift would require a major cultural change in how people use technology — especially in public spaces.

Behind The Device: OpenAI wants you to talk out loud… just not to yourself.

OpenAI doesn’t believe the LLM powering ChatGPT’s audio experience is as strong as its text-based one, so it’s restructuring teams to make audio the priority.

The goal, according to The Information, is to make responses more accurate and speed up how quickly the chatbot answers questions… all while feeling like a natural conversation partner.

So far, the company has developed a new model that sounds more natural and “emotive” (read: human) and can provide deeper, more accurate answers.

The next step is advancing it so it can better handle interruptions and speak at the same time as a human user — just as we do when talking to another person.

Closing Thoughts: OpenAI plans to release the new audio model sometime early this year… ideally giving people enough time to adjust to talking to ChatGPT before a device rollout in 2027. Right now, most people interact with the chatbot through text-based prompts — but OpenAI didn’t spend $6.5 billion to acquire iPhone designer Jony Ive’s io just so users could keep tapping a touchscreen. Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman want to replace the iPhone.

It may be OpenAI’s most ambitious bet yet.

The Future: OpenAI’s biggest hurdle in getting people to adopt its ChatGPT devices may be convincing them that talking to a chatbot out loud isn’t a faux pas.

From Invisible To Irresistible: How UGC Helped This Brand Pop Off The Shelf

What if the biggest unlock for your CPG brand isn’t a packaging refresh or a promo blitz — but creators telling the story your audience actually wants to hear? That’s exactly what happened when this everyday grocery staple shifted from traditional ads to a creator-led, UGC-powered strategy built for scale.

Instead of pushing polished product shots, the brand activated creators across food, lifestyle, and everyday routines — pairing premium gifting with seasonal moments and culturally relevant hooks. The result wasn’t just content; it was momentum. Snack boards, game-day recipes, self-care rituals, and kitchen-counter creativity started taking over feeds, delivering 560K+ views, 247K reach, 9K likes, 2K saves, and $58K EMV — all from authentic storytelling that felt like discovery, not advertising.

More importantly, it became repeatable. Mid-tier creators expanded visibility. Micro-influencers added warmth and trust. And with Creator.co managing recruitment, briefs, and delivery, the brand built a scalable content engine — everything from 71K-view recipe videos to 600+ saved snack hacks. As one marketing leader put it, “The team is accessible, easy to work with, and provides frequent updates — all our data was right at our fingertips.”

When UGC becomes the heart of your strategy, your product stops blending in and starts belonging in the lives (and carts) of your consumers.",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/16ad69aa-50a5-4ced-a73d-4d8ece9c0089/oepnai_jan_5.JPG?t=1767577892,N,,2026-01-05 05:14:31.957103

All preconceived ideas about this were wrong after the earthquake occurred in the bank of JPMorgan Chase (a $4 trillion financial institution) with their creation of MONY, a tokenized money market fund which exists on the Ethereum Blockchain, which has rocked the Financial Services industry. They have created a programmable version of this product, making it one of the most significant advancements in technology for traditional banks. As a result of this creation banks now have new thoughts regarding money than they had ever before.

Enter MONY: Cash on the Chain

MONY (My OnChain Net Yield) is a new form of fund that is a departure from traditional institutional funding models. Unlike previous institutional funding models, MONY utilizes a public blockchain (Ethereum), leveraging the bank’s proprietary Kinexys Digital Assets platform.

Investors who meet qualifications for MONY will be able to hold digital tokens representing a fractional ownership position in a collection of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of less than 12 months. The difference between MONY and previous funding models is that due to the programmability of these tokens, they will include on-chain record of the daily dividend payments, and allow for both subscription and redemption using fiat currency and stablecoins. This innovation will allow for near real-time settlement of applications for subscriptions or redemptions, and addresses the longstanding issues associated with T+1 and T+2 timeframes commonly associated with traditional money market funding models.

The Strategic Shift

Money market funds are the unglamorous plumbing of the global financial system, holding over $7 trillion in assets to preserve capital and manage liquidity. For years, this scale made them too important to risk on “experimental” technology.

Nonetheless, with the enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) in July 2025, there was a significant shift in the perceived risk associated with the use of blockchain technology. This legislation gave banks a clear path to starting using stablecoins and tokenized assets in a compliant manner. Banks now have the necessary guidance and framework to begin issuing new products through the blockchain, thus moving JPMorgan out of the sidelines and onto the field.

Two Visions for the Future

JPMorgan’s bold stance is a signal that the gap in ideology on Wall Street continues to grow. On the one hand, as a “cloud-native” business, JPMorgan has chosen to issue tokens directly onto a public blockchain. Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon, on the other hand, have taken a somewhat more reflective and cautious approach.

Earlier this year, the Goldman-BNY alliance launched a joint initiative to tokenize records of existing funds rather than creating blockchain-native funds. In their model, the assets stay in traditional systems while tokens act as digital mirrors.

“There is a divide in these approaches,” notes one fintech analyst. “Some see blockchain as a new financial operating layer—the JPMorgan view—while others see it merely as a faster database that leaves existing control structures intact. Both are progress, but they are building toward very different futures.”

The Gatekeeping Debate

MONY is not an open multi-party DeFi Protocol but rather a highly-controlled access protocol intended for select Qualified Institutional Investors with significant minimum commitments; as a result, some people see MONY as hindering the idea of financial decentralization instead of enabling it.

Some see proof of this with the model that MONY is using because it only allows those who are able to invest large amounts and that those who do are all large banks or corporations, thus there is a danger that MONY is simply replicating the same issues that exist in traditional banking; the supporters of MONY argue that for this model to work at scale, large financial pools will require a specific level of institutional trust. An institution will require a high level of regulatory compliance, custody, and risk management around its investments and therefore will not be able to use a completely open and trustless DeFi protocol.

A Signal to the Boardroom

Rather than being primarily a product launch, the launch of MONY provides both an opportunity for corporate boards and treasury managers to realize that digitizing cash is now inevitable vs possibly. Furthermore, tokenising cash will offer firms opportunities for transferring value with the same ease as transferring information. This will lead to reduced risk in settlement processes and allow firms to release capital previously tied up in bank accounts. Due to the increasing number of firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, looking at this type of structure, as well as the growing number of firms using on-chain treasury solutions, competitive pressures will increase dramatically in 2026. As the market continues to grow, the speed at which it will impact traditional plumbing systems in daily financing will continue to accelerate.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jpmorgan-mony-fund-e1767556256414.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 09:00:34.659063

The French beauty conglomerate has unveiled two light-powered innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, including a Light Straight + Multi-styler flat iron, which uses near-infrared light technology to straighten and style hair at reduced temperatures, and LED eye masks meant to combat visible signs of under-eye aging.

Both products will launch in 2027 under respective, yet-to-be-confirmed brands within L’Oréal’s portfolio, which includes Lancôme, Vichy, SkinCeuticals and more in skin, and L’Oréal Professionnel, Redken and Color Wow, among others, in hair.

The Light Straight builds on the patented powering L’Oréal Professionnel’s AirLight Pro hair dryer, which L’Oréal unveiled at CES 2024 and has since rolled out to salons in the U.S., Europe and Asia, as well as on Amazon and Ulta Beauty, where the tool sells for $475.

“We’re using the same type of technology to straighten the hair three times faster [than a traditional flat iron], make it two times smoother and use up to 100 degrees less heat,” said Guive Balooch, global vice president, augmented beauty and open innovation at L’Oréal.

The Light Straight features glass plates which never exceed 320 degrees Fahrenheit and work in tandem with the near-infrared technology to style the hair while reducing the risk of heat damage. It can also be maneuvered to create waves and curls.

While the AirLight Pro was developed in partnership with hardware start-up Zuvi, the Light Straight was developed in-house, added the executive.

The LED Eye Masks, developed in partnership with iSmart Developments, deliver red light and near-infrared light treatment in timed, 10-minute sessions. There are 16 LED chips per silicone-based eye mask, totaling 32 LED chips in both.

“Because the material is so thin and so flexible, we can make masks that are targeted to different parts of the face — like the chin, the neck,” said Balooch, adding that L’Oréal is also developing a full-face version of the mask, which features 208 LED chips and “sits on the skin like a sheet mask would.”

LED masks and facial devices have become increasingly popular in recent years, with prominent players including Therabody — which recently signed Kendall Jenner as an ambassador for its $379 TheraFace Mask Glo; Shark Beauty, and Solawave, known for its $169 red light therapy wand.

L’Oréal’s eye masks, which are still prototypes, will mark the company’s first foray into the category. In terms of pricing, the masks “will be within the middle-range of premium products,” said Balooch.",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LOreal-launches.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2026-01-05 05:58:57.854960

The focus is on two things: the official start of construction of the new NVIDIA headquarters in Taiwan and the legendary “trillion-dollar dinner” with the island’s most important suppliers.
With the “Constellation” project, NVIDIA will establish its first global headquarters outside the USA.
Huang himself had already made it clear at Computex that NVIDIA does not regard Taiwan as an extended workbench, but as a strategic center.
NVIDIA knows this, and Jensen Huang knows that trust in Asia is not built by contract, but by presence.","When Jensen Huang travels to Taiwan, it is no longer a courtesy visit. It is a signal. According to reports in the Taiwanese media, the NVIDIA CEO is planning several symbolically and strategically charged appointments this month, which can hardly be read as anything other than a geopolitical and industrial positioning. The focus is on two things: the official start of construction of the new NVIDIA headquarters in Taiwan and the legendary “trillion-dollar dinner” with the island’s most important suppliers.

Let’s start with the sober part. With the “Constellation” project, NVIDIA will establish its first global headquarters outside the USA. The location is the Beitou-Shilin Science Park in Taipei, an area of just under 3.9 hectares that will house several thousand employees in the future. This is not a satellite office, but an institutional anchor. Huang himself had already made it clear at Computex that NVIDIA does not regard Taiwan as an extended workbench, but as a strategic center. In retrospect, the fact that the project stalled for a while due to insurance issues seems more like a technical stumbling block than a political doubt. With Huang’s signature, the launch is now set to go ahead.

However, the real explosive issue is not in the concrete, but at the dinner table. The “trillion-dollar dinner” is more than folklore. When representatives from TSMC, Foxconn, Quanta, Wistron and other partners gather, it’s not about thank-you speeches. It’s about clocking, capacities and trust. NVIDIA has long been operating at the limits of what traditional supply chains can achieve. Every day of delay in CoWoS, packaging or server integration costs millions, and in the age of AI, billions. The timing is no coincidence. Taiwan’s suppliers are currently working on the ramp-up of Blackwell Ultra and are already preparing the next generation, known internally as Rubin. This parallelization is extremely demanding. Anyone who underestimates a bottleneck here risks not only delays in delivery, but also market share. NVIDIA knows this, and Jensen Huang knows that trust in Asia is not built by contract, but by presence.

Taiwan has long been more than just a production location for NVIDIA. It is a neuralgic hub of the global AI infrastructure. Huang himself has repeatedly described the island as one of the most important locations for the company. That may sound diplomatic, but it is factually correct. No modern NVIDIA GPUs without TSMC, no scalable AI systems without the ODMs, no speed without local proximity.

You can dismiss this dinner as a ritual. But you can also read it for what it is, a silent demonstration of power. While other tech companies talk about reshoring and diversification, NVIDIA is tying its partners closer than ever. Not a PR event, but a dependency lived out at eye level. In a world where AI is becoming infrastructure, evenings like this are perhaps more important than any keynote at CES.",https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Jensen.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:27:13.446576

Brand lift and sales lift across in-store digital signage will become key metrics in what may emerge as the next major wave of U.S. retail media innovation.","Amazon and Walmart may be known globally as retail powerhouses, but their real profit engines lie elsewhere. For Amazon, it is AWS. For Amazon and Walmart, it is the fast‑growing world of retail media and data‑driven advertising. One year after Walmart acquired TV manufacturer Vizio, the strategic impact on Walmart Connect is becoming unmistakable. Walmart is rapidly transforming from a traditional retailer into a vertically integrated media company with reach across its 4600 stores, online platforms and, increasingly, the living room screen.

NRF The Big Show 2026 – North America’s leading retail tech event takes place 11-13 January in New York City. Florian Rotberg will be on site to bring invidis and sixteen-nine readers the latest news from the showfloor and the conferences.

The acquisition of Vizio in December 2024 for USD 2.2 billion (invidis report) marked a turning point in the U.S. retail media landscape. Walmart, already one of the country’s largest sellers of TVs through its physical stores, gained not primarily a TV manufacturer but a proprietary smart TV operating system with deeply embedded advertising capabilities. Since then, Roku, long a prominent player in CTV advertising and also rooted in digital signage history through its joined Brightsign heritage, has been losing ground as Walmart pushes its own ecosystem.

The timing could not have been better. The U.S. retail media market grew by around twenty percent in 2025, but Walmart Connect expanded significantly faster. The company reported thirty‑three percent growth in the last quarter alone, driven by online placements, in‑app advertising, in‑store screens and especially connected TV. When including the contribution of Vizio, Walmart’s global advertising business grew by more than fifty percent. The addition of a proprietary Connected TV platform has allowed Walmart to capture new revenue streams from non-endemic like automotive, financial services and quick‑service restaurants. Some of these new clients now rank among the largest spenders on the Walmart DSP.

The strategic value of the Vizio integration becomes clear in how Walmart combines its first‑party shopper data with CTV delivery. Vizio advertisers can target audiences based on verified Walmart shopping behaviour and measure the direct sales impact generated by campaigns shown on Vizio devices.

The company is rolling out the Vizio operating system to its private‑label Onn TV line, a move that could extend the OS’s reach to between a quarter and a third of all U.S. households. Such scale would place Walmart among the most influential CTV platform owners in the market, with a closed ecosystem reaching from hardware to measurement.

Impact on SoC-Platforms

Walmart and Amazon are the most important sales channel for TVs from Samsung, LG & Co. Their most important channel partner becomes now a serious competitor not only for TVs but also new competition for Google Android, Samsung Tizen and LG WebOS and their ambitious Ad-sales goals. The fully integrated Ad business model works tremendously good – according to Walmart Connect, shoppers exposed to CTV ads are twenty‑eight percent more likely to purchase products through Walmart.

The company sees a direct correlation between the number of consumer touchpoints a brand activates and the resulting increase in conversion, which strengthens its commitment to a multi-screen strategy spanning online, in-app, in-store and CTV environments.

Measurement is a central pillar of Walmart’s approach

Over the past year, the retailer has been expanding incremental return on ad spend metrics beyond display and video to include search and other formats. Brands increasingly expect consistent and comparable KPIs across all advertising surfaces, whether inside a Walmart store or on external channels. Walmart now provides closed-loop measurement across a wide array of media partners, including TikTok, Meta, TV networks and bespoke integrations such as a dedicated measurement partnership with Disney. The aim is to ensure that every impression can ultimately be tied back to sales outcomes.

While CTV is currently driving the most momentum, Walmart continues to invest heavily in the long-anticipated frontier of in-store retail media. The company is developing the hardware, adtech and measurement frameworks required to scale in-store advertising beyond pilot implementations. Importantly, Walmart emphasizes contextual relevance: bakery screens will serve food‑related messages, not generic electronics promotions. Brand lift and sales lift across in-store digital signage will become key metrics in what may emerge as the next major wave of U.S. retail media innovation.

Shopper Data is key – also for RMN-experts like Stratacache, Stingray, CRI & Co

US digital signage specialists such as Stratacache, Stingray and CRI face increasing pressure as retail media becomes a fully integrated discipline inside major retail giants. Shopper data has emerged as the decisive competitive advantage – and it is an area where vertically integrated retailers like Walmart set benchmarks that third‑party network operators cannot easily match. Stratacache’s PRN division once pioneered Walmart’s early in‑store media networks, but the era of outsourcing has ended for the world’s largest retailer. Today, Walmart controls its own retail media stack end‑to‑end, from data to measurement to CTV integration, leaving external vendors with far fewer opportunities at the very top of the market.

Across North America’s grocery, pharmacy and DIY sectors, however, the landscape looks different. While most supermarket groups now run internal retail media organisations responsible for monetisation and data strategy, the design, rollout and technical operation of in‑store networks remain largely in the hands of digital signage specialists. Stratacache and Stingray dominate these large‑scale deployments, but competition is intensifying as CRI, Wovenmedia and others position themselves as full‑service RMN partners for retailers that lack Walmart‑level resources. The battle for retail media network leadership beyond Amazon and Walmart is therefore shifting to supermarket and DIY chains, where operational expertise, flexible infrastructure and the ability to align with retailer‑owned shopper data will define the winners.",https://invidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-AUS-Walmart-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:27:34.359793

They stop you mid-scroll. According to Indian Tech & Infra, the Tata Group–owned brand sold 220 T-shirts, 60 pairs of denims, 250 fragrances, and 330 lipsticks every single minute last year. Let that sink in. While most fashion brands are busy chasing trends and attention, Zudio was quietly ringing up bills at a pace few expected.

By the end of FY25, the Mumbai-based retailer crossed the $1 billion revenue mark, a milestone many global fast-fashion players are still trying to crack in India. Even more telling? The brand managed to double its store count in just two years. No overnight miracle. No sudden viral moment. Just steady, deliberate growth.

Advt

Market analysts say this kind of scale doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of a very clear strategy - one that understands how India actually shops.

Instead of building hype, the brand built reach. While many brands poured money into celebrity endorsements and flashy launches, it focused on opening stores where people actually live and shop. Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities became its stronghold, tapping into a customer who wants to dress well but also wants prices that feel reasonable, not aspirational.

And that formula worked. Fast.

The brand’s racks move quickly because the clothes make sense. They’re trend-aware without being intimidating. Affordable without feeling throwaway. Fashion you can pick up without planning for it, sometimes even while doing your grocery run.

Of course, there’s debate around this success. Some critics say the brand’s rise proves India is still driven by volume, not premium fashion. But others see it differently. They believe it cracked middle-class psychology, the balance between wanting to look current and needing to stay practical. Once that balance is right, scale follows almost naturally.

Financially, the growth came with trade-offs. Trent, the Tata Group company behind Zudio, reported strong revenue gains even as margins tightened - a common story when a brand expands this aggressively. Hundreds of new stores mean higher costs today, but also deeper roots for tomorrow.

Advt

What’s interesting is how the brand now sits almost shoulder to shoulder with global fast-fashion giants, not by copying them, but by doing something very Indian. Keeping things simple. Keeping prices honest. And showing up everywhere.

Selling hundreds of products every minute isn’t just a flex. It’s proof that an Indian brand, built on clarity and consistency, can compete at scale without shouting about it.

And sometimes, that’s the smartest fashion move of all.

By Nate Allen

FAYETTEVILLE - Between a new/old warmup revived from the 1960s to a complete team for the first time, Eric Musselman promises a new look to his Arkansas Razorbacks for their official men’s basketball season opener tonight off their recent two exhibition games.

At 7 tonight at Walton Arena on the Razorbacks Radio Network and Internet video available on SEC Network Plus, Arkansas opens its campaign against the 1-0 Macon, Ga. based Mercer University Bears of the Southern Conference.

Kamani Johnson, the transfer power forward via the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, missed both exhibition victories over East Central (Okla.) University and the University of North Texas because of an injured wrist.

Starting sophomore letterman center Jaylin Williams missed the Oct. 30 UNT game with back spasms but has practiced daily since the Razorbacks resumed drill Monday after taking Sunday off.

Trey Wade, the graduate transfer power forward via Wichita State, missed nearly all of preseason including the exhibition against ECU with a knee injury but did log 16:46 vs. UNT without ill effects. All three should be available tonight, Musselman said.

“We’re healthier than we’ve been say in the last two months,” Musselman said. “So that’s a positive that we do have the injured guys back in the fold.”

Johnson, practicing with the Hogs since last Dec. 19 signing as a redshirting transfer, is especially ready to play a Razorbacks game.

“I’ve been sitting for probably around a year or so,”Johnson said to media last Friday. “So I couldn’t even put it into words how excited I am to step on the court and finally be a part of what it is to be an Arkansas Razorback. I’m super excited about it.”

Musselman said against UNT he had figured on a 5-minutes stint each half at most for Wade. He said he was surprised not by just how long Wade played but how effectively. The Hogs played plus 15 for Wade’s minutes though Musselman said Wade really doesn’t know his new team’s plays since he had been unable to practice them.

“Maybe that surprised me a little,” Wade said of the knee holding up for a nearly 17-minutes debut. 'I already knew once he put me on the floor it was going to be hard to take me out. I know how to get in the game and be productive regardless of if I really know the plays or not. It's just about being a basketball player.”

In tonight’s pregame, Razorbacks fans will see if their players new and returning can drill like Harlem Globetrotters.

Musselman said he’s reviving the Globetrotters like pregame warmup that his father, the late Bill Musselman, first invoked coaching Ashland College in the 1960s and brought to the University of Minnesota. Eric also used it for awhile coaching the University of Nevada.

Musselman said his father planned it to entertain the fans but certainly to benefit the players.

“He wanted his players to have great fundamentals handling the basketball,” Musselman said. “He wanted his team to be locked in and the warmup and helped with skills, as well. Nine of our players have learned to juggle three basketballs. Most of our team can all spin the ball on their finger. A lot of two-ball dribbling. Just a lot of skill stuff that we’ve worked on.”

Power forwards Wade and Johnson don’t seem the 3-balls in the air type but said they will surprise.

“You’ve got to get to the seats early and then you can find out what all I can do and what all the team can do,” Johnson said.

In the meantime, focus hasn’t been lost on Mercer returning three key starters from last season’s 18-11 Bulldogs and adding graduate transfer forward Jalen Johnson experienced both in the ACC and SEC.

Guard Neftali Alvarez, swingman James Glisson and forward Felipe Haase are three key returnees and joined Johnson and 6-6 Shawn Walker opening Wednesday’s 93-61 victory over Fort Valley State.

Alvarez led with 19 points. Johnson scored 12. Reserves Shannon Grant and Kamar Robertson scored 17 and 13.

“Alvarez, is a very, very good ball-handler,” Musselman said. “Very crafty. Loves to dribble drive right. Has got a great spin dribble. Really good in transition. One of the best guards in their league if not the best guard in their league. No. 22 (Felipe) Haase played for the Chilean national team. He can really shoot the ball. He plays the 5-spot for them. He’s a trail pick-and-pop guy. Johnson played for Tennessee and Wake Forest, a transfer at 6-6, 6-7. A very, very good 3-point shooter. Good defender because of length. Last night they made 13 threes. So this is a team that can really, really shoot the basketball. Glisson, is an offensive rebounding, high-energy player. Grant is a big body, physical who had 17 points. Those guys in particular are who we're focused on right now.”

Musselman has tinkered with lineups during the exhibitions.

In this story, we highlight sets of wheels that’ll get you gunning into the new year with poise and power.

Corvette Stingray

Who’s to say you shouldn’t start the year with a red-line roar? The arrival of the Corvette Stingray in Singapore last year marked a significant moment for the city’s high-octane landscape, as one of the most storied sports cars in the US finally took its place on local tarmac.

Seven decades of Corvette heritage sit behind the latest Stingray, yet its focus is firmly forward. A mid- mounted 6.2-litre V8 delivers 495 horses, sending the car from nought to 100km/h in 2.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 312km/h. The standard Z51 Performance Package adds track-tuned suspension, performance exhaust, larger brakes, and Michelin Pilot Sport 4S ZP tyres.

Visually, the Stingray expresses speed in sculpted form. Its canopy- forward stance draws inspiration from F-22 and F-35 fighter jets, as well as Formula One cars, giving it a low, wide, purposeful silhouette. A glass rear hatch puts the engine on display, while inside, a hand-wrapped leather cockpit cradles the driver like a fighter jet seat. The cabin is enhanced with a Bose Performance Series audio system and practical features, including a front suspension lift for navigating city streets and dual trunks spacious enough for golf bags.

Corvette

Aston Martin DB12

Few statements feel as decisive as receiving the keys to a DB12. Billed as the first of a new generation of Aston Martin sports cars, it ushers in a fresh chapter for the marque and for the DB bloodline: an ultra-luxury super-tourer that elevates the grand tourer idea by several notches.

Under the sculpted bonnet lies a hand-built 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8, tuned to deliver 680PS and 800Nm of torque. It covers the century sprint in 3.6 seconds and reaches a top speed north of 320km/h. New-generation adaptive dampers, an electronic rear differential, and bespoke 21-inch Michelin Pilot Sport 5 S tyres give the DB12 remarkable breadth, from supple and refined in GT mode to taut and alive in Sport and Sport+ when the road opens up.

The exterior is a study in renewal, rendered in metal. A wider stance, more muscular surfacing, and an all-new front end give the DB12 an assertive, almost architectural presence, framed by new LED headlights and a reshaped front grille. It is also the latest Aston Martin sports car to wear the newest evolution of the brand’s wings, a detail that signals a broader design reset.

Inside, the refresh extends to a driver-focused cockpit, combining hand-stitched leather and modern quilting with the brand’s in-house infotainment system, high-resolution displays, and an optional Bowers & Wilkins audio set-up.

Through Q by Aston Martin, owners can use the DB12 as a starting point to commission anything from a single distinguishing detail to a fully bespoke specification. With a new palette of colours, materials, and finishes, the possibilities are extensive, allowing the car to mirror whatever chapter they are stepping into.

Launched in the same year Aston Martin marks its 110th anniversary (and 75 years of DB models), the DB12 feels like a line in the sand, a signal that the next era has arrived. A fitting way to embrace renewal might well be committing to a car that is purpose- built for new horizons.",https://robbreport.com.sg/storage/2025/12/The_New_Aston_Martin_DB12_15-1-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 22:58:51.517725

The Philadelphia Eagles needed to beat the Washington Commanders in Week 18 and get some out-of-town help to clinch the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs for a second year in a row.

But they were foiled Sunday in the regular-season finale by the most unlikely character: third-string Commanders quarterback Josh Johnson — a 39-year-old journeyman who hadn’t won an NFL start since 2018.

Washington’s 24-17 road win left the Eagles as the No. 3 seed in the NFC. Philadelphia (11-6) will face the sixth-seeded San Francisco 49ers (12-5) in the opening round. It will be a rematch of the 2023 NFC Championship Game, a 31-7 Eagles win.

Because the Detroit Lions upset the Chicago Bears on Sunday, the Eagles would have been the No. 2 seed had they beaten the Commanders (5-12).

But with the NFC East title already assured, the Eagles made it clear that wasn’t their priority. They started backup quarterback Tanner McKee and rested starting QB Jalen Hurts, tight end Dallas Goedert, wide receiver A.J. Brown, running back Saquon Barkley and a host of other mainstays on both sides of the ball. Wide receiver DeVonta Smith exited early after reaching 1,000 receiving yards for the season. The Commanders sat left tackle Laremy Tunsil and started Johnson for a second consecutive game after injuries to Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota.

McKee finished 21-for-40 passing for 241 yards and a touchdown, and he was sacked three times and threw an interception. The Eagles’ three fourth-quarter drives ended in a punt and two turnovers on downs.

Johnson, meanwhile, brought the Commanders back from a 17-10 fourth-quarter deficit with two touchdown drives, scoring the decisive touchdown on a third-and-goal scramble from the 1-yard line with 2:32 left.

49ers up next

The Eagles spoiled an opportunity to secure the No. 2 seed, and they’re now preparing to host the 49ers. Had the Eagles jumped to the No. 2 seed, they would have hosted the Green Bay Packers, who have lost four in a row. The Eagles did not play the 49ers this season. They last played in the 2023 regular season, when the 49ers’ 42-19 victory avenged their loss in the NFC Championship Game months earlier. If the Eagles beat the 49ers and the Bears beat the Packers, the Eagles would travel to Chicago in the divisional round. With the No. 2 seed, the Eagles would instead have hosted the Bears. The Eagles could still host a divisional-round game with a win and a Bears loss. The Eagles knew the stakes entering the game and favored rest — what they viewed as a manufactured bye — entering the postseason. — Zach Berman, Eagles beat writer

Eagles backups can’t hold

An Eagles defense that fielded mostly backups could not deny the Commanders from scoring touchdowns on two consecutive goal-to-go scenarios to finish the game. When Johnson scrambled for that 1-yard touchdown to set the final score, the only Eagles regulars involved were along the defensive line. Jalyx Hunt, Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo and Nolan Smith started. Hunt capped a second season in which he substantially improved by jumping a Johnson pass for his third interception of the season. Hunt led the Eagles in both interceptions and sacks (6.5) in 2025.

The performance of the Eagles’ secondary once again revealed its lack of depth. Apart from his interception, Johnson was 14-for-22 passing for 131 yards and a touchdown. The Commanders converted six of 11 third downs, converted their only fourth-down situation and scored three touchdowns on their four red-zone trips. Backup defensive backs Jakorian Bennett, Mac McWilliams and Kelee Ringo were each flagged for pass interference. (Bennett was flagged twice.) The Eagles are far more formidable under Vic Fangio when playing at full strength. The playoffs will reveal how beneficial it was for the starters to receive a rest. — Brooks Kubena, Eagles beat writer

McKee’s uneven day

McKee had an uneven audition for the rest of the NFL and couldn’t deliver the Eagles a victory as he did in the season finale last year. McKee, the Eagles’ third-year backup quarterback, has been a subject of intrigue in Philadelphia throughout his Eagles career. The interception was especially costly, coming at the Commanders’ 20-yard line with a chance to score. He also couldn’t lead the Eagles on a game-tying drive late in the game. The caveat is McKee, in his only start of the year, played with reserves against the Commanders’ starting defense, so his performance might have looked different had he played with the Eagles’ starters. McKee excelled in relief last season and followed it up with a sterling outing in the preseason, prompting curiosity about his future with the team. McKee has one year left on his contract and there could be outside interest from teams seeking a potential starting quarterback. But that case would have been stronger with a win and gaudier statistics. — Berman

Washington will pick seventh

Washington finally got a win, but it came at a cost: The Commanders fell to No. 7 in the draft order after entering the game at No. 6 (courtesy of the Cleveland Browns’ earlier win over the Cincinnati Bengals in addition to other results). — Nicki Jhabvala, Commanders beat writer

Johnson’s moment

Sunday was for Johnson. He threw his first touchdown since 2021 and scored his first rushing touchdown since 2018. — Jhabvala

Washington’s mistakes persist

Washington’s defense needs so much work. The Commanders continue to miss routine tackles, continue to give up easy yards in the middle of the field, continue to struggle with covering tight ends and continue to make backup quarterbacks look like seasoned veterans. Unlike last season, when they seemingly mastered situational ball, the Commanders often appeared sloppy and inattentive this season. And safety Quan Martin’s rough season was capped by losing the start to Jeremy Reaves. Martin was benched twice earlier for mistakes in games. This was the first time he was benched as a starter. Martin entered this game with an average of 18.7 yards allowed per catch, the highest average among safeties with at least 500 coverage snaps. He had allowed a 151.8 passer rating when targeted in coverage. — Jhabvala",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/04194756/GettyImages-2254675397-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-04 22:58:46.977749

Investors seem to be cautiously rewarding these health and tech pushes, with Walmart’s 90 day share price return of 9.8% and 1 year total shareholder return of 25.4% pointing to steady, not euphoric, momentum.

If Walmart’s moves have you thinking about where else growth and execution might line up, it could be worth exploring as a fresh hunting ground for ideas.

With shares up strongly over the past year and trading only modestly below analyst targets, the key question now is whether Walmart is still mispriced or if the market is already accounting for years of health and AI driven growth.

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 5.6% Undervalued

With Walmart closing at $112.76 against a widely followed fair value near $119, the dominant narrative sees modest upside still on the table.

Expansion of high margin business streams Walmart Connect (advertising, up 31 46% globally), marketplace, and Walmart+ memberships (global advertising up 46%, membership income up 15%) is diversifying Walmart's income base beyond retail, gradually transforming the company's profit mix and resulting in structurally higher net margins and earnings over time.

Want to see why a mature retailer is being modeled with the kind of margin and earnings profile usually reserved for premium platforms? The most popular narrative quietly rewrites Walmart’s profit mix, leans on steady top line growth, and bakes in a forward earnings multiple that many investors would not expect for this sector. Curious which assumptions have to hold for that valuation to work?

Result: Fair Value of $119.45 (UNDERVALUED)

However, persistent e commerce losses and rising wage and claims costs could crimp margins and challenge the idea that higher tech driven profitability is locked in.

Another Way to Look at Value

On earnings based valuation, Walmart looks stretched. Its price to earnings ratio of 39.2x sits well above the Consumer Retailing industry at 22.8x, the peer average at 26x, and even its own 38x fair ratio. This implies limited margin for error if growth stumbles.

By Josh Recamara

Jan 04, 2026 Share

AXA UK veteran Dougie Barnett (pictured) is retiring, following a career spanning more than four decades across underwriting, risk management and loss prevention.

Barnett most recently served as the company's director of mid-market and customer risk management. He began his insurance career in 1982 with Sun Alliance's underwriting team in Glasgow. Five years later, he moved to New Zealand Insurance, where he specialised in risk management.

Early challenges

Barnett joined AXA UK in July 2001 as a risk surveyor in Glasgow and was promoted later that year to UK property risk technical manager. One of his earliest and most significant challenges in the role came in the aftermath of the collapse of Independent Insurance, which triggered a severe capacity shortage in the food manufacturing sector. Barnett led AXA UK’s response, developing a structured risk matrix that enabled the insurer to re-enter the market and support brokers placing complex food sector risks at a time of widespread disruption.

Barnett also represented AXA UK on a number of Association of British Insurers (ABI) strategic programmes. Through this work, he engaged with government departments and regulators on issues including the use of composite panels in food risks, as well as the broader economic impact of fire and flood losses and their knock-on effects on mortgage availability and property lending.

Building partnerships

In 2004, Barnett launched AXA UK's first building valuation service in partnership with Cunningham Lindsay, responding to persistent underinsurance issues in larger commercial property portfolios. He was promoted to lead AXA UK's risk management team in 2006, where he oversaw the development of technical standards and broker-facing risk support.

In later years, Barnett established the company's global loss prevention board and helped develop the insurer's approach to emerging risks, including green buildings, sustainability-related property exposures, electric vehicles and sustainable transport. He also became a founder member of the AXA Group Global Risk Management Board, contributing to global strategy, policy development and talent programmes across Europe and Asia.

Barnett also served as a regular media spokesperson for AXA UK, providing industry commentary across trade and national outlets on property risk, loss prevention and emerging risk issues.

If IBM's shift toward hybrid cloud and AI has caught your eye, it is also worth exploring other innovative tech names using our screener for .

With IBM now trading just shy of analyst targets after a powerful multi year run, investors face a key question: is there still upside left in the hybrid cloud and AI story, or is future growth already priced in?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 1% Undervalued

With IBM closing at $291.5 against a narrative fair value near $293.9, the storyline assumes only a slim remaining upside from here.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $281.316 for International Business Machines based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $350.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $198.0.

Curious how modest revenue growth, rising margins and a rich future earnings multiple can still point to upside from today’s price, despite tight projections?

Result: Fair Value of $293.89 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, that story could fray if macro uncertainty slows consulting demand or if Red Hat’s consumption growth undershoots, which would challenge IBM’s mid single digit revenue ambitions.

Another Angle on Valuation

On earnings, IBM screens pricey, trading on a 34.4x price to earnings ratio versus 21.3x for peers and 28.8x for the broader US IT group. Yet Simply Wall St’s fair ratio of 37.9x hints the market might still edge higher, leaving investors to weigh upside against the risk of de rating.

But it was Porter who led the way with an efficient game-high-tying 27 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.
I’m sure he’d disagree with me completely, which is OK, but we won a lot of games doing it that way.","Brooklyn’s Michael Porter Jr. returned from illness just in time to face the team that traded him over the summer. And he made that reunion a winning one.

Porter led the Nets to a 127-115 victory over the Nuggets before a sellout crowd of 17,548 at Barclays Center on Sunday.

It snapped a three-game skid, and was especially sweet for Porter, who won the 2023 title with the Nuggets only to be salary dumped last summer by Denver.

“I was excited for that first match really since I’ve been traded, the way that all went down,” said Porter. “I was looking forward to playing against those guys. For sure it’s been circled on my calendar for a minute. I probably got a little bit more nervous for this one than a lot of other games. So it was fun.”

The Nets (11-22) had a season-high six players muster at least 13 points as they shot 50.6 percent and 14-for-33 from deep. But it was Porter who led the way with an efficient game-high-tying 27 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.

“I think it means a lot to him because he’s been there for a long time, and he’s got a lot of people they shared the locker room for a long time,” Jordi Fernández said of Porter, whom he spent four seasons with as a Denver assistant. “I’m very happy for the group. I’m very happy for Michael.”

A starter on the Nuggets team that won the 2023 title, Porter nevertheless took a backseat to the two-man game of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. The Nets dealt Cam Johnson for Porter and Denver’s unprotected 2032 first-round pick, a swap that was initially panned but is looking more and more like a Brooklyn steal.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS

Entering Sunday, Porter was the only qualified player in the East averaging at least 25 points and seven rebounds, and one of five in the entire league, joining Jokic, Luka Doncic, Lauri Markkanen and Deni Avdija. More to the point, the Nets are winless without him (0-6), but 11-16 with him — winning eight of his last 11.

With Jokic sidelined by a hyperextended left knee, and Johnson out with a bone bruise in his right, Murray poured in 27 points and 16 assists, while Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 26.

The Nets had more than enough to overcome that, Porter’s production backed by forward Noah Clowney (20 points) and Day’Ron Sharpe. The latter filled in admirably for starting center Nic Claxton with 17 points, six rebounds, four assists, three steals and just a single turnover.

“Well, coming in here, I told everybody we locked in,” said Sharpe. “So, we just wanted to rally as a team to help get the Dub for him.”

Brooklyn was clinging to a tenuous 63-56 lead after Murray found Peyton Watson underneath 1:51 into the second half. But they ripped off an extended 21-10 run over the next five minutes, including the final seven unanswered points to seize control of the game. They never gave the lead back.

The Nets hit eight of nine shots in the blitz, including all four from 3-point range. Egor Dëmin had five points and two assists in the game-deciding run, including the final dagger off a Porter feed to make it 84-66 with 5:10 left in the third.

Brooklyn built the lead to 19 and never let it get below double digits, seeing the game out behind Porter.

“He’s got a lot of freedom here. This trade was good for everybody. He won a championship with us. He’s one of the main reasons we did it,” said Nuggets coach David Adelman, who was an assistant alongside Fernández. “Any time you win the whole thing, the role was appropriate. Michael, we know how talented he is.

“Mike has this ability, he always has, but for us, he sacrificed…Our two-man game has been successful, and him in the corner with Aaron Gordon in the dunker spot, was quite a thing. Michael, I thought we used him in the right way. I’m sure he’d disagree with me completely, which is OK, but we won a lot of games doing it that way. It’s cool to see him have some more freedom here under Jordi.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-jzemcesi3-1767570105642.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767552132&w=1200,N,,2026-01-04 20:58:33.076892

THERE HAS been a lot of attention recently on tax reform. There are few issues that unite Canadians so much as when we complain about how much we pay in taxes.

While reform is important, unfortunately there is not much attention paid to tax enforcement or collection. How will reform help matters if we won’t pursue offenders? Why aren’t we applying the existing laws? Why aren’t Canadian politicians, tax experts and the public insisting that offenders are paying their fair share of taxes?

There are many misconceptions about taxes. Let’s focus our attention on those who offend rather than those who comply.

Some Uncomfortable Truths

An uncomfortable truth is that the Income Tax Act (the Act), at over 3,700 pages, is designed to be confusing. Despite the odd public pronouncement denouncing the complexities of the Act there is little appetite for reform once you realize who benefits from the status quo.

Rules are easy to break when there are so many exceptions. The biggest beneficiaries of today’s confusing Act are multinational corporations and wealthy individuals. Whenever wealthy individuals, from Mr. Bezos to Mr. Balsillie to Mr. Buffet, are challenged about their tax avoidance schemes they roll out the standard defence: “we are in compliance with all of the rules and regulations.” And many lawyers and accountants oppose simplification of the Act. What better way to increase billable hours?

Another Myth

Many pundits argue that lower tax rates encourage businesses to invest. This is debatable as there are many other factors to consider. However, we know that lower tax rates encourage multinational corporations and wealthy individuals to shift assets and income to lower tax jurisdictions, which is not the same as investing in these jurisdictions. Wealth has no loyalty, and limited ties, to its host country.

Do lower tax rates help the economy?

Let’s examine Ireland, which is often lauded by pundits who advocate for lower corporate tax rates in Canada.

A few years ago Microsoft Corporation transferred its licensing rights to Microsoft Ireland. Microsoft Ireland in turn charged Microsoft Canada a royalty so that revenues were eliminated in Canada but recorded in Ireland. An Irish tax rate of 12.5% versus Canada’s tax rate of 26.1% is tax avoidance and does not encourage investment in Ireland or Canada.

And you would think that the Irish State, in the example above, would be pleased with the extra tax revenue. Think again. In 2016 the European Commission (EC) pursued Apple Inc. for offshore profit shifting and tax avoidance. The EC announced in 2024 that Apple owed the Irish State 13 billion euro including penalties and interest. Not surprisingly Apple appealed the initial ruling of the EC.

What was surprising was that the Irish State rejected this significant tax windfall and joined forces with Apple against the EC. If Canada enacted lower corporate taxes would we too fall into the trap of appeasing a large employer such as Apple?

More Avoidance

In 2008 the Internal Revenue Service in the US compared the Forbes 400 annual listing of wealthy individuals to amounts declared by these individuals when they died. Approximately half of the wealth of these individuals was declared, which suggests a significant shield on inheritance taxes. The type of tax that is easy to apply to the population, such as income tax and sales taxes, is not as easy to apply to wealthy people.

Avoidance Closer to Home

Canadians for Tax Fairness reported last year that Canada’s largest corporations and wealthiest families have transferred $682 Billion to tax havens. They note that 75% of companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 have at least one subsidiary in a tax haven, including all of the big Canadian banks and insurance companies, Shopify and Cenovus. In 2024 these 60 companies avoided $7 Billion in taxes.

Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) is one of the biggest offenders when it comes to tax avoidance. Brookfield has more subsidiaries in tax havens than any other company on the S&P/TSX60.

Canadians For Tax Fairness, in October 2022, concluded that Brookfield had the largest tax gap, of $6 billion, in Canada between 2017 and 2021. Most of Brookfield’s operating businesses are carried out in Bermuda. Brookfield’s effective tax rate has been below Canada’s statutory tax rate in nine of the last ten years and, in five of those years, below 13% (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence). Brookfield stated in a recent proxy circular: “Brookfield and our perpetual affiliates are in full compliance with all applicable tax laws …”.

Why not align reform with collection?

Wouldn’t effective tax collection ease the strain of federal and provincial budget deficits? Since wealth leaks to the lowest tax jurisdiction, the Group of Twenty (G20) established a Global Minimum Corporate Tax Rate. The goal of this effort is to overhaul the manner in which large multinational corporations are taxed and to align the taxation of the digital economy based on location of sales rather than headquarters.

Tax reform is meaningless unless it is aligned with tax collection. Let’s hope that the moral obligation to pay our fair share of taxes spurs tax reform, and simplification of the Act, in a meaningful direction.",https://cdn.agilitycms.com/canadian-accountant/Tax-Reform-VI-660px.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 21:58:54.516036

The gist: OpenAI is reportedly accelerating its audio AI roadmap to support its upcoming screenless hardware device designed by Jony Ive.

Key details: The company targets a Q1 2026 release for a new full-duplex voice model, with the hardware device following in early 2027.

Why it matters: This aggressive timeline contrasts with major delays at Google and Apple, who have pushed their next-gen assistants to Spring 2026.

Context: Achieving seamless, interruption-tolerant voice interaction is the critical technical hurdle for ambient computing devices to succeed.

OpenAI is reportedly accelerating its audio AI roadmap to support its upcoming screenless hardware. For its upcoming high-fidelity voice model designed to handle complex, real-time interruptions, the company is now targeting a Q1 2026 release.

Laying the necessary groundwork for the AI device being developed with Jony Ive, the former Apple design chief, this software sprint targets an early 2027 hardware launch. Such a fast-paced schedule contrasts with major delays at rivals Google and Apple, who have pushed their own updates to Spring 2026.

The Software Sprint: A New Foundation for Voice

Reports indicate the company has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to focus on a single vertical for audio development. By unifying these departments, OpenAI aims to produce a model capable of full duplex communication by the first quarter of 2026.

Current voice assistants typically require a pause before processing input, creating a turn-taking dynamic that feels unnatural. A reported by The Information, OpenAI targets the ability to speak simultaneously with the user and handle interruptions without latency.

Control: Keep everything private: data stays in your browser, with import/export and version history.

Framing the upcoming device as a fundamental shift in user interaction, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted, “I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely reimagine what it means to use a computer.”

Moving from active command input to passive, ambient interaction requires near-zero latency. While the gpt-realtime launch in August 2025 reduced costs by 20%, it maintained the standard request-response architecture.

To demonstrate the baseline capabilities that the new model aims to surpass, OpenAI previously released benchmarks for its current technology.

Supporting a device without visual feedback requires the upcoming model to exceed the 82.8% reasoning score on the Big Bench Audio evaluation achieved by the current version.

The Hardware Endgame: Jony Ive’s Ambient Ambition

Serving as the critical dependency for OpenAI’s consumer hardware ambitions, the software roadmap aligns directly with the device timeline. Developed in collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive, the device is now expected to launch in approximately 12 months.

Refining the confirmed device timeline provided by Altman in November 2025, the new estimate narrows the window from a broader “less than two years.”

According to reports, the OpenAI device will reportedly eschew screens entirely, relying on the new audio model as its primary interface. Previous attempts at this form factor, such as the Humane AI Pin, failed largely due to slow response times and connection errors.

To address these specific performance bottlenecks, the company has reportedly adopted a staggered release strategy. The updated audio model will reportedly debut first in the opening quarter of the year, establishing the necessary low-latency infrastructure.

This software foundation will then pave the way for the hardware itself, which is now projected to ship in approximately 12 months, placing the likely release window in early 2027.

Internally, the project has absorbed significant talent, including key designers from Apple. Developers on the hardware team are betting that the new audio model will solve the latency issues that plagued earlier screenless devices.

Google and Apple and the Voice Assistant Race

OpenAI’s primary competitors are also addressing quality control issues. Google has officially confirmed delaying the sunset of Google Assistant in favor of Gemini Live on mobile devices until March 2026.

User feedback indicating that the Gemini-based replacement lacked the reliability of the legacy Google Assistant for basic tasks necessitated the decision. Citing the need for a seamless transition rather than a forced upgrade, executives opted to delay the rollout.

Apple, which is lacking substantially in terms of AI capabilities, has pushed the release of its “Siri V2” overhaul to a Spring 2026 target window following a eadership shakeup.",https://winbuzzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/openai-logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:59:35.484620

In 1811, as England’s Industrial Revolution was gaining momentum, a group of textile workers decided to fight back.

Led by the mythical “General Ludd” of Sherwood Forest, what began as a concentrated movement in central England quickly spread across the nation. Traditional workers took hammers to the stocking frames and power looms – the machines erasing their jobs, their wages, and centuries of hard-won craft.

They weren’t irrational or anti-progress. They were simply watching their livelihoods evaporate in real time, and they understood that no one was coming to help them.

And it took generations of political struggle to rebuild something resembling dignity for working people.

Right now, a similar story is unfolding. This time, AI is the existential threat.

While investors are worrying about if Big Tech is spending too much on AI, the ground beneath our feet – the very foundation of how we earn a living – is turning into quicksand.

The biggest risk we face isn’t a bear market or even a crash in the Nasdaq.

It’s the permanent devaluation of human labor…

The Iceberg Index: The Truth About AI Job Loss in America

The latest research shows just how far this displacement has already advanced beneath the surface.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, partnering with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, recently released what it calls the “Iceberg Index” – and it’s terrifyingly blunt.

The study’s models suggest that roughly 12% of existing U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI right now.

That’s 1 in 9 people whose economic output can be matched by a software subscription that doesn’t need health insurance and doesn’t take bathroom breaks.

We aren’t even talking about what happens when the AI further matures.

When an AI agent can not only write the email but also plan the project and execute the code migration without human intervention, the need for human “managers” in the middle evaporates.

We are already seeing the results…

HP Inc. (HPQ) just announced it is cutting up to 6,000 jobs by 2028 to “fund AI investment.”

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) cut 12,000 corporate roles earlier this year, explicitly stating that automation means those jobs aren’t coming back.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is undergoing its biggest corporate layoff ever.

This isn’t recessionary. This is a capital pivot. Companies are trading variable-cost, high-maintenance human workers for fixed-cost, exponentially improving silicon ones.

AI Is Breaking the Link Between Productivity and Wages

For the last century, as technology improved, productivity went up. As productivity went up, wages did, too. A rising tide lifted all boats, even if some boats were lifted higher than others.

But AI is breaking that link.

When a company deploys an AI system that allows it to double its output without hiring a single new employee, where does that extra value go?

It does not go to the remaining workers. It goes to the company’s bottom line, and then to dividends, buybacks, and a higher share price.

And that doesn’t even take an economic downturn into account.

Right now, we have historically low unemployment (around 4%). The economy is showing cracks but is still fairly stable. And yet, companies are aggressively automating.

Imagine what happens in a recession.

Economists call it the “cleansing effect.” When revenue dips, companies are forced to cut costs and jobs mercilessly.

The recession will be the accelerant. The recovery will be jobless.

Workers Must Shift From Labor to Capital to Survive the AI Era

So, if the value of labor is crashing and the value of capital is skyrocketing, the solution is uncomfortably simple.

You need to stop thinking like a laborer and start thinking like a capitalist.

This brings us to the “stock bubble.” You might be worried that Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is overpriced at its current valuation. Fair enough.

But if you have zero exposure to the companies building the infrastructure of the future, you are betting your entire financial existence on your ability to outwork software that doubles in ability every 18 months.

That is a terrible bet.

The only true hedge against the devaluation of your labor is to own stock in the companies that are benefiting from labor devaluation. You need to be on the receiving end of that wealth transfer.

If the AI boom continues, these companies will generate unprecedented cash flows. If the “AI bubble” pops, the tech doesn’t go away. It just gets cheaper for companies to deploy, accelerating the labor displacement even faster.

In either scenario, capital wins.

How to Protect Yourself From AI Job Loss: A Two-Part Strategy

Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Great advice. I’ll just take this spare $3 million and buy a diversified portfolio of AI infrastructure stocks so I can live off the dividends when my job is automated.”

Indeed, replacing an entire salary with capital returns requires a massive amount of money that most of us simply don’t have.

So, you need a two-part “barbell strategy” for survival.

Immediate Financial Exposure: You cannot afford to sit this market out because it’s “frothy.” You need exposure to the picks and shovels of this gold rush – the chip designers, hyperscale cloud providers, foundational model companies, etc.

Become ‘Human Capital’: Until you have enough capital to retire, your labor is still your primary asset. You have to upgrade it.

The labor market is bifurcating into two categories: commodity labor versus agency labor.

You need to be the latter. Stop writing copy. Start orchestrating the brand voice that AI brings to life.

The people who will thrive in the transition period aren’t just the ones owning Nvidia stock. They are the ones who can walk into a panicked C-suite and say: “I can replace your inefficient 20-person department with myself, three sharp lieutenants, and a fleet of AI agents – and save you 40%.”

Wield AI as a weapon for your own advancement.

The Labor Market Is Approaching a Breaking Point

Exponential curves look flat for a long time … and then, suddenly, they go vertical.

We are right at the knee of that curve. The window to prepare is closing faster than most think.

It’s best to stop agonizing about whether we are in a 2000s-style stock bubble. A stock market crash hurts your portfolio temporarily. A structural shift in the value of human labor hurts your family permanently.

As automation accelerates and data centers explode in size, the U.S. is quietly executing what many insiders are calling a modern “Manhattan Project for AI.”

And Washington isn’t just funding this initiative. It’s partnering directly with select American companies it views as essential to winning the AI race — and those stocks are erupting.

This year alone, several smaller U.S. firms surged 200%… 300%… even 400% in a matter of days after government investment or contract news broke.

These aren’t hype-driven rallies. They’re the early winners of America’s AI buildout — the companies being positioned at the center of a multiyear national transformation.

And while millions of workers brace for AI-driven disruption, investors who understand where Washington is placing its strategic bets could be on the receiving end of one of the last great wealth transfers of our lifetime.

That’s why I’ve been working on something urgent, which you can now see for yourself.

I’ve identified a handful of overlooked American companies that I believe are next in line for government backing — and each has the potential to soar 10X as this new AI buildout accelerates.

I reveal the first one — 100% free — in my new briefing.

Click here to learn how to position yourself before the next government-backed breakout.

Consider it the first plate on your barbell.

Without timely treatment, patients may face amputation.
With a history of kidney failure, including a kidney transplant, Bridgen returned to the doctors with resurfacing kidney failure symptoms.
Through pre-kidney transplant assessments, doctors discovered a blockage and finally diagnosed Bridgen with PAD, upon which they offered IVL treatment.
Both Dr Portou and Dr West believe that the main barrier affecting patient outcomes is the misdiagnosis of PAD symptoms.","Patients suffering from peripheral artery disease (PAD) are increasingly being offered a treatment by doctors called intravascular lithotripsy (IVL). Developed by Shockwave Medical, part of Johnson & Johnson Medtech, Shockwave IVL was adapted from extracorporeal lithotripsy, a treatment that uses sound waves to break down kidney stones. The goal was to use similar acoustic wave technology to modify calcium in diseased arteries without damaging surrounding tissues.

IVL is used to treat cardiovascular diseases complicated by the buildup of calcium on the artery walls, called calcification. Calcification both restricts blood flow and limits the effectiveness of conventional treatments for PAD, including balloon dilatation (angioplasty) and stenting.

PAD is a condition where cholesterol-rich deposits accumulate in the arteries, forming narrowings. Such deposits may become calcified, restricting blood and oxygen flow to the limbs, over time leading to severe leg pain, limited mobility, and tissue damage and sometimes necessitating amputation. PAD primarily affects older adults and people with diabetes or kidney disease, but it is also tied to other risk factors including smoking and a genetic history of PAD.

IVL cracks calcium through the generation of shock waves, a form of ultrasonic acoustic pressure wave, with a lower pressure peak than extracorporeal lithotripsy. IVL is delivered by emitters placed within a balloon angioplasty catheter and can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatments such as atherectomy, angioplasty or stenting.

""The balloon is inflated at low pressure to avoid vessel damage, and an electrical current is passed to the emitter, creating an acoustic pressure wave,"" says Dr Nick West, chief medical officer at Shockwave Medical. ""That pressure wave is what cracks the calcium. What you're left with is a blood vessel that becomes more compliant – less stiff, if you like – so that you can expand it with conventional tools.""

IVL is enhancing how physicians and surgeons treat patients with calcified lesions, including the most severe form of peripheral artery disease – chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). CLTI is a progressive condition and represents the end stage of PAD, where in some cases extremely calcified arteries severely restrict blood and oxygen flow to the legs, leading to pain, ulcers and gangrene. Without timely treatment, patients may face amputation. However, IVL is a treatment option that could be used to attempt to avoid that outcome.

Treating calcified arteries in CLTI patients can be challenging, as the patient's arteries are more fragile, rigid and at higher risk of complication than in less severe cases of PAD, Dr Mark Portou, a consultant vascular surgeon in London, explains. For eligible patients whose doctors have recommended this treatment, the benefits can be significant.

Despite the known risk factors and prevalence of PAD, public knowledge surrounding the condition is limited. Over 200 million people are living with PAD worldwide, Dr Portou says, yet few know what it is. It remains a condition which is underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Belinda Bridgen suffered for five years before being diagnosed with PAD at the age of 70. Leading up to her diagnosis, she endured constant pain in her hip and leg. She visited doctors with these symptoms, but none ever mentioned the possibility of it being PAD.

Bridgen assumed her symptoms were a result of ageing. She subsequently visited a surgeon, who proposed back surgery. She underwent the procedure in 2022, hoping it would ease her discomfort – however it did not. As a result of the back surgery being ineffective, Bridgen thought that she would have to live with the debilitating pain that made even her short walk to the bus stop difficult.

In early 2025, doctors found a blockage in Bridgen's right iliac artery. With a history of kidney failure, including a kidney transplant, Bridgen returned to the doctors with resurfacing kidney failure symptoms. Through pre-kidney transplant assessments, doctors discovered a blockage and finally diagnosed Bridgen with PAD, upon which they offered IVL treatment.

Individual patient results may vary, but in Bridgen's experience, after a few weeks of tender bruising at the site of insertion of the IVL catheter, Bridgen was soon walking more comfortably. Her destinations now stretch much further than the post box – she can now walk to the pub to meet up with friends too. ""I've got my life back,"" she says, as she talks about her upcoming trip to Croatia and the prospect of finally joining guided walking tours that she used to sit out.

Bridgen stresses the importance of visiting a doctor as early as possible. Many patients delay getting assessed because they are afraid their symptoms may signal the need for a severe medical procedure.

Both Dr Portou and Dr West believe that the main barrier affecting patient outcomes is the misdiagnosis of PAD symptoms. Even among healthcare professionals, symptoms are often written off as signs of ageing, poor mobility, simple musculoskeletal issues or diabetes, they explain.

This lack of understanding can lead to delayed treatment and severe consequences. For example, approximately 20% of patients suffering with CLTI might require limb amputation within a year of diagnosis.

""The mortality for [CLTI] is worse than many cancers, which people don't realise. That needs to change,"" says Dr West. ""The symptoms can seem mild at first and patients often don't report them. That delay in diagnosis is one of the biggest obstacles to improving outcomes.""

As the global population ages and rates of diabetes continue to climb, technologies like IVL could play a vital role in preserving limbs and lives, especially when paired with patient and physician education. While IVL offers a step forward in treatment, it is still only serving as part of a wider scope of surgical and non-surgical options, not a cure. It requires experience and good clinical judgment and individual patient results may vary. ""This isn't a silver bullet. It's one part of a broader treatment paradigm that includes early diagnosis, appropriate screening and lifestyle management,"" says Dr West.

Patients should seek appropriate treatment for PAD, which may include IVL, to reduce the risk of serious complications, including a life-altering limb amputation. ""IVL is not a miracle and sometimes might not be enough,"" says Dr Portou. ""But it gives us a chance. When we save a limb, we're not just saving a foot, we're helping to save independence, mobility and a person's confidence to keep living.""",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1920x1080/p0mhlm9s.jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 16:59:01.060791

While everyone chases the loudest AI ticker, this low-key industrial beast has been stacking real-world power plays and serious stock performance. So… is Parker-Hannifin actually worth your money, or just another background player you can ignore?

Real talk: if you care about steady growth, dividends, and companies that build the hardware behind literally everything that moves, you need to at least know this name.

The Hype is Real: Parker-Hannifin on TikTok and Beyond

Parker-Hannifin is not a meme stock. It’s not trending every second. But that’s exactly why long-term investors are paying attention. Instead of going viral for chaos, it’s quietly winning for execution.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch honest tests on YouTube

On social, the vibe is simple: this is a “grown-up” stock. Think engineers, builders, and finance creators who are over chasing the latest rug-pull and want something that actually throws off cash.

The Business Side: Parker-Hannifin Aktie

Let’s zoom in on the numbers, because that’s where Parker-Hannifin (ISIN: US7010941019) really starts to flex.

Stock data check-in:

According to multiple live feeds from major financial platforms (such as Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Parker-Hannifin trades on the NYSE under the ticker PH.

As of the latest available market data from these sources, the quote being shown reflects the most recent trading session’s last close, not a live intraday move.

I am not able to access a fully up-to-the-minute live price feed right now, so I will not guess a number. All current pricing, performance charts, and intraday moves should be pulled directly from a live source like:

Yahoo Finance – PH quote

MarketWatch – PH overview

Always double-check the latest price, percent change, and market cap there before you trade.

Here’s why the stock has serious “no-drama, all-business” energy:

Industrial backbone: Parker-Hannifin builds motion and control systems – hydraulics, pneumatics, filtration, aerospace tech. Basically, if it moves, lifts, flies, or operates in a tough environment, there’s a decent chance Parker has a part in it.

Revenue from the real economy: This isn’t pure hype. The company sells into manufacturing, energy, aerospace, transportation, and more. When big infrastructure and industrial projects go up, Parker gets paid.

Dividends + long-term compounding: It’s widely known as a solid dividend payer with a long history of returning cash to shareholders while still investing in growth.

On the clout scale, this is not a “look at my 10x YOLO” stock. It’s more of a “my portfolio aged up, and now it actually makes sense” type of move.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let’s break Parker-Hannifin down into three big angles: growth, stability, and hype potential.

1. Growth: Quiet but serious

Parker-Hannifin has been using acquisitions and tech upgrades to scale up. It’s pushing deeper into high-margin areas like aerospace and advanced motion control, where customers care about reliability way more than shaving a few bucks off.

This means it’s not just a “metal and pipes” company. It’s moving into smarter, more engineered systems that lock in long-term customers.

2. Stability: Big boomer energy (in a good way)

If you’re tired of watching your feed melt down every time a meme stock pops or drops, Parker-Hannifin is the opposite vibe. It’s been around for a long time, it serves massive industries, and it tends to track with the broader economy more than whatever is trending this week.

That doesn’t mean it can’t drop. Industrial stocks can get hit when growth fears spike. But compared to some flashy tech names, this one has actual assets, real contracts, and physical products people can’t just “unsubscribe” from overnight.

3. Hype potential: Under-the-radar flex

Parker-Hannifin is never going to trend like a meme token. But it has its own kind of clout: institutional respect. Long-only funds, pension money, and serious dividend investors pay attention to names like this.

So no, you’re probably not getting a viral spike out of nowhere. But over time? The stock has a track record that makes analysts treat it like a legit compounder, not a lottery ticket.

Parker-Hannifin vs. The Competition

Every industrial giant has rivals. For Parker-Hannifin, think big diversified players in motion, control, and industrial tech. One of the closest headline rivals is Eaton (ticker: ETN), another major name in power management and industrial systems.

Parker-Hannifin vs Eaton: Who wins the clout war?

Brand vibe: Eaton has slightly more mainstream recognition in some energy and electrical circles, but neither name is exactly a TikTok darling. Parker wins with deeper engineering cred across hydraulics and motion systems.

Diversification: Both are diversified, but Parker-Hannifin’s reach into aerospace and motion control gives it exposure to defense and aviation – sectors that can be very profitable in the right cycle.

Investor perception: Eaton often gets framed as a “power and electrical” play; Parker is seen more as a high-spec industrial and aerospace systems specialist. If you want more pure electrical infrastructure, Eaton has the edge. If you want motion, hydraulics, and aerospace strength, Parker stands out.

Who takes the win? From a social and narrative standpoint, neither is a hype machine. But if you want the under-the-radar pick with serious engineering depth and exposure to high-tech industrial applications, Parker-Hannifin quietly edges ahead.

Is It Worth the Hype?

This isn’t a stock you brag about in the group chat for instant clout. It’s the stock you brag about in five or ten years when everyone else is wondering how your “boring” picks pulled ahead.

Where Parker-Hannifin shines:

Real talk: It’s tied to physical infrastructure, manufacturing, aerospace, and energy – stuff that doesn’t vanish overnight.

Price performance: Historically, it’s been a strong compounder with periods of serious outperformance, especially when industrial and infrastructure spending is hot.

Risk level: Lower drama than hyped growth names, but still cyclical. When the economy slows, orders can cool off and the stock can wobble.

If you’re hunting for a “must-have” meme rocket, this is probably a drop. If you’re trying to build a portfolio that could still make sense years from now, Parker-Hannifin is very much in cop territory for further research.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Here’s the blunt breakdown.

Game-changer? In your portfolio strategy, yes. This is the kind of industrial name that can anchor a more mature, diversified setup. In terms of internet culture? Not really – it’s not a viral celebrity stock.

Price drop bait? When markets panic on growth fears or industrial slowdowns, stocks like Parker-Hannifin can pull back. For long-term investors, those dips can turn into “must-cop” entries if you actually believe in the business.

Is it worth the hype? For serious, patient investors: absolutely worth a closer look. For short-term clout-chasing: probably not your move.

Your move: If you’re building a grown-up portfolio, put Parker-Hannifin on your watchlist, dig into the latest earnings reports and guidance on its investor site at parker.com, and cross-check the latest price and valuation metrics on a live platform before you tap buy.

GE’s fridge meets this by blending hardware with software, much like how smartphones evolved from calls to life hubs.","In the bustling world of home appliances, where innovation often promises to simplify daily chores, General Electric has unveiled a refrigerator that could redefine how households manage their groceries. Announced just ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in 2026, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator integrates a built-in barcode scanner, a camera system, and seamless connectivity with Instacart, aiming to automate the tedious task of inventory tracking and shopping list creation. This isn’t just another smart fridge with a touchscreen; it’s a device that actively scans items as they’re placed inside, recognizes when supplies are low, and populates a digital shopping cart without user intervention.

The core feature revolves around the patented barcode scanner, embedded in the fridge’s interior. Users simply wave an item’s barcode in front of the scanner upon restocking, and the system logs it into an inventory database. As items are depleted—detected via internal cameras that monitor shelves—the fridge automatically adds them to a grocery list accessible through a companion app or an integrated 8-inch tablet on the door. This integration with Instacart allows for one-tap ordering, potentially turning the refrigerator into a proactive household manager. According to details from Engadget, the technology draws on AI to predict needs based on usage patterns, such as suggesting milk refills if the scanner notes frequent scans of cereal boxes.

Industry observers note that this launch comes at a time when consumers are increasingly seeking ways to reduce mental load in the kitchen. GE’s press release highlights how the Kitchen Assistant feature—essentially the fridge’s AI brain—can even scan perishables for freshness, alerting users to impending expirations via notifications. Priced at around $3,500, the 27.9 cubic foot model positions itself as a premium offering, blending French-door aesthetics with cutting-edge tech that could appeal to busy families and tech-savvy professionals alike.

Unpacking the Technology Behind the Scan

Delving deeper into the mechanics, the barcode scanner isn’t a mere gimmick; it’s powered by advanced optical recognition software that interfaces with a vast database of product UPC codes. This allows the fridge to identify not just the item but also its typical shelf life and nutritional data, which can feed into meal planning suggestions. The internal cameras, meanwhile, use computer vision algorithms to estimate quantities—say, how many eggs are left in a carton—without requiring manual input. GE claims this reduces food waste by up to 20%, a statistic echoed in early reviews from tech sites.

Integration with Instacart is particularly noteworthy, as it leverages the delivery service’s API for real-time pricing and availability checks. Users can customize preferences, like opting for organic alternatives or specific brands, and the system learns from past orders to refine suggestions. As reported by The Verge, this fridge builds on previous smart kitchen experiments but introduces a level of automation that feels genuinely hands-off, distinguishing it from competitors like Samsung’s Family Hub, which relies more on manual list-building.

For industry insiders, the real intrigue lies in the data ecosystem. GE’s appliance connects to the company’s broader smart home platform, potentially sharing insights with other devices like ovens or pantries. This could enable scenarios where the fridge communicates with a smart oven to suggest recipes based on available ingredients, further embedding AI into everyday cooking routines.

Market Positioning and Competitive Edges

Positioned against a backdrop of evolving consumer behaviors, GE’s fridge taps into the growing demand for connected kitchens. Recent posts on X highlight user excitement, with many praising the potential for seamless grocery automation amid rising food costs and time constraints. One viral thread discussed how such tech could alleviate the “mental load” of meal planning, drawing parallels to earlier innovations like Amazon’s Dash buttons.

Comparisons to rivals are inevitable. LG and Samsung have long dominated the smart fridge segment with features like door-in-door access and integrated screens, but GE’s barcode focus addresses a specific pain point: forgetting what’s inside. Mashable notes in its CES coverage that while Samsung’s models offer recipe apps and family calendars, they lack this inventory-scanning precision, which could give GE an edge in efficiency-driven markets.

From a business perspective, this launch aligns with GE Appliances’ strategy under Haier ownership to innovate in the premium segment. Sales data from recent years show smart appliances growing at a 15% annual rate, per industry reports, and GE aims to capture a slice by emphasizing practicality over flashy gimmicks. Insiders speculate that partnerships like Instacart could expand to other services, such as Amazon Fresh or local grocers, broadening appeal.

Challenges in Adoption and Privacy Concerns

Yet, no innovation is without hurdles. Early adopters might face compatibility issues, as the scanner relies on standard barcodes; unpackaged produce or bulk items could require manual entry via the app. Moreover, the always-on cameras raise privacy questions—GE assures users that footage is processed locally and not stored in the cloud, but skeptics point to past data breaches in smart home devices.

Cost remains a barrier; at $3,500, it’s a significant investment compared to basic models under $1,000. Tom’s Guide highlights in its review that while the tech justifies the price for high-income households, broader adoption might hinge on scaled-down versions or subsidies through energy-efficient incentives.

On the regulatory front, as smart devices proliferate, there’s increasing scrutiny over energy consumption and e-waste. GE’s model boasts Energy Star certification, but insiders worry about the environmental impact of embedded electronics that could shorten appliance lifespans.

Broader Implications for Kitchen Innovation

Looking ahead, this fridge exemplifies a shift toward predictive appliances that anticipate needs rather than merely respond. Drawing from X discussions, enthusiasts envision ecosystems where fridges integrate with robotic kitchens, like the CA-1 system in Germany that automates cooking, potentially creating fully autonomous home food management.

GE’s approach could influence supply chains, too. By aggregating user data (anonymized, per the company), manufacturers might gain insights into consumption trends, aiding inventory for retailers. GE Appliances’ press room emphasizes how this reduces the “grocery guesswork,” a sentiment echoed in business analyses predicting a $50 billion market for smart kitchen tech by 2030.

For developers and engineers, the open APIs hinted at in the launch could spur third-party apps, from dietary trackers to sustainability monitors, fostering an innovation ecosystem around the device.

Evolving Consumer Expectations and Future Horizons

Consumers today expect appliances to do more than preserve food—they want them to enhance lifestyles. GE’s fridge meets this by blending hardware with software, much like how smartphones evolved from calls to life hubs. Posts on X from tech influencers underscore this, with some comparing it to Amazon Go’s cashierless stores, where sensors automate transactions seamlessly.

Potential expansions include voice control via integrations with Alexa or Google Assistant, allowing verbal queries about inventory while cooking. BusinessWire details how the Kitchen Assistant evolves with over-the-air updates, ensuring the fridge improves post-purchase.

Ultimately, success will depend on user feedback. Pilot programs in select markets could refine features, addressing any glitches in barcode recognition or app usability.

Industry Ripple Effects and Strategic Insights

The ripple effects extend to competitors, who may accelerate their own scanner integrations. Samsung, for instance, has experimented with AI cameras, but GE’s patent could provide a temporary moat. Analysts predict this could boost GE’s market share in North America, where smart home adoption lags behind Asia.

From an investment standpoint, Haier’s backing positions GE to leverage global manufacturing for cost efficiencies. CNET explores how this tech might “change grocery shopping forever,” by making lists dynamic and context-aware.

In supply chain terms, automated reordering could stabilize demand for staples, benefiting producers and reducing waste across the board.

Pushing Boundaries in Home Automation

As kitchens become smarter, ethical considerations emerge. Who owns the data from your fridge? GE pledges transparency, but industry watchers call for stronger standards. X threads debate this, with some users excited about personalized nutrition advice, others wary of surveillance.

Future iterations might include scent sensors for spoilage detection or AR overlays via the tablet for virtual meal prep. Yahoo Finance reports on the launch’s stock impact, noting a bump in investor confidence.

For insiders, this fridge signals a maturation of IoT in homes, where devices don’t just connect—they collaborate to streamline life.

Refining the Vision for Tomorrow’s Kitchens

Refinement will come from real-world use. Beta testers report high accuracy in scanning, but edge cases like faded barcodes pose challenges. GE’s roadmap includes machine learning updates to handle such variances.

Broader adoption could influence urban planning, with smart fridges in apartments reducing trips to stores and easing traffic. Posts on X from urban dwellers highlight this appeal in dense cities.

In essence, GE’s innovation bridges the gap between convenience and intelligence, setting a new benchmark for what a refrigerator can achieve in the modern home.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-5438-1767550816.jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 14:13:14.936079

data shows more than 12,000 news stories mentioned “AI bubble” in November alone — roughly matching the total from the prior ten months combined.","As enthusiasm around artificial intelligence continues to propel stock markets to record levels, a growing number of investors are asking a familiar question: are we watching another financial bubble form one that could eventually burst?

‍

History suggests the answer isn’t black and white.

‍

The S&P 500 climbed 16% in 2025, driven largely by AI heavyweights such as Nvidia, Alphabet, Broadcom, and Microsoft. At the same time, unease has been building over the massive sums Big Tech is pouring into AI infrastructure. Capital spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta is projected to jump 34% to about $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data.

‍

Beyond public markets, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure a staggering figure for a privately held company that has yet to turn a profit. Adding to investor concern is the circular nature of many of these arrangements, where funding and spending cycle between OpenAI and a small group of publicly traded tech giants.

‍

According to Brian Levitt, chief global market strategist at Invesco, periods of technological transformation have often been accompanied by excessive investment. He points to past revolutions such as railroads, electricity, and the internet as examples where capital poured in aggressively before demand fully materialized.

‍

“At some point, infrastructure spending can overshoot what the economy needs in the short term,” Levitt said. “But that doesn’t mean the railroads weren’t completed or that the internet didn’t ultimately reshape the world.”

‍

Still, with equity valuations inching higher and the S&P 500 logging its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, investor anxiety is understandable. Many are questioning how much upside remains and how severe the downside could be if AI fails to deliver on its promise. That risk is magnified by the fact that Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, and Meta now make up nearly 30% of the S&P 500, meaning any sharp selloff in AI stocks would ripple through the broader market.

‍

“A bubble usually bursts in a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who does not believe AI stocks are currently in a bubble. “And we don’t see a bear market on the horizon.”

‍

So how does today’s AI boom compare with past market bubbles?

‍

One way to assess whether the AI-fueled rally has moved too far, too fast is to compare it with historical bull markets. Research from Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett, examining 10 equity bubbles worldwide since 1900, found they lasted just over two and a half years on average and delivered gains of about 244% from trough to peak.

‍

By contrast, the current AI-driven advance is entering its third year. Since the end of 2022, the S&P 500 has risen 79%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has surged 130%.

‍

While the data doesn’t point to a definitive conclusion, Hartnett cautions against abandoning equities solely out of bubble fears. Historically, the final phase of a rally tends to be the strongest, and missing it can be costly. As a hedge, he suggests selectively adding cheaper value exposures, such as UK stocks or energy companies.

‍

Market Concentration

The S&P 500’s 10 largest companies now account for roughly 40% of the index a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has unsettled some investors, including veteran strategist Ed Yardeni, who said in December that he no longer recommends overweighting technology stocks.

‍

Market historians note, however, that today’s concentration is not without precedent. Paul Marsh, a professor at London Business School who has studied 125 years of global market returns, points out that leading stocks held similar weightings in the 1930s and 1960s. In 1900, railroads made up 63% of U.S. market value, compared with about 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024.

‍

Fundamentals

Identifying bubbles in real time is notoriously difficult, largely because debates hinge on fundamentals and those metrics evolve, said Dario Perkins, an economist at TS Lombard.

‍

“It’s easy to argue that ‘this time is different’ and that traditional valuation measures no longer apply,” he said.

‍

Even so, some fundamentals still matter. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders generally carry lower debt relative to earnings than companies such as WorldCom did in the late 1990s. Moreover, firms like Nvidia and Meta are already reporting meaningful profit growth tied to AI, something that was largely absent during the speculative boom 25 years ago.

‍

That said, rising credit risk is making some investors uneasy. After Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, its stock fell 5.6% the following day and is down 37% since. Looking ahead, Meta, Alphabet, and Oracle are expected to raise a combined $86 billion in 2026, according to estimates from Société Générale.

‍

Valuations

By some measures, the S&P 500 is trading at its highest valuation ever outside of the early 2000s. Its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio — developed by economist Robert Shiller and based on inflation-adjusted earnings over a decade — sits near historic extremes.

‍

Optimists counter that while valuations are rising, the pace is far more measured than during the dot-com bubble. In 2000, Cisco traded at more than 200 times trailing earnings. Nvidia, by comparison, trades at under 50 times earnings today.

‍

According to Janus Henderson fund manager Richard Clode, bubbles typically form when stock prices detach entirely from earnings growth. “We’re not at that point yet,” he said.

‍

Investor Scrutiny

Talk of an AI bubble simmered throughout the year but intensified in November and December following warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. data shows more than 12,000 news stories mentioned “AI bubble” in November alone — roughly matching the total from the prior ten months combined.

‍

A December Bank of America survey found investors view an AI bubble as the market’s biggest “tail risk,” with more than half citing the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street’s most crowded trade.

‍

That environment contrasts with the dot-com era, when enthusiasm for the internet went largely unquestioned, said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays. Today, scrutiny is growing, particularly as companies ramp up borrowing to fund AI investments.

‍

“I wouldn’t dismiss the risks,” Krishna said. “But healthy skepticism is a good thing. That scrutiny may be exactly what prevents the kind of extreme excesses that lead to a crash.”

— Cat and Dog Lover

DEAR CAT AND DOG LOVER: That’s a timely question as the holiday season which began more than six weeks ago finally comes to a close after Jan. 6, the Feast of the Epiphany.

Feasting is the theme in the winter months, and given that many pets, particularly dogs do not get as much exercise when it’s cold out, monitoring your pet’s weight is key.

The rule of thumb for dogs and cats is that they should consume no more than 25 to 30 calories per pound per day. So a cat who weighs 10 pounds should be consuming no more than 300 calories a day.

Veterinarians recommend that treats compose no more than 10 percent of the total number of calories, so a 10-pound cat should have 270 calories of food, and no more than 30 calories a day in treats.

Many cat treats are 1 or 2 calories each and these should be given sparingly — never by the handful.

If your dog is 50 pounds, that’s around 1,400 calories per day with no more than 140 calories composed of treats.

Our dog gets a Pedigree Dentastix at the end of her day, which is 65 to 75 calories per stick. Just one however!

Vets in North America report obesity is one of the leading issues with pets they treat. And obesity can lead to a number of health problems including: osteo-arthritis and joint inflamation, cardiovascular and endocrine malfunction and metabolic abnormalities.

If your pet is heavy, they are more likely to have more health challenges and a shorter life.

Smaller dogs are more likely to be obese, with pugs topping the list.

So, how can you help your pet lose weight?

First, be a responsible pet owner from the day you adopt your pet. Know how much your pet weighs and read labels on food so you are not giving your pet more calories than they need.

Finally, do not substitute food and treats for attention and exercise. They’re not asking for a treat. They’re asking for you to pay attention to them.

Give them vigorous petting and show some love.

We asked our Be PAWSitive community how they handled weight gain in pets. Mary Flibbert of Worcester helped her 18-pound cat reduce to 14 pounds by eliminating treats and dry food.

“All I did was feed him all the canned food that he wanted,” she reports.

TheraPAWS Pet Team member Cap Corduan has Keifer, a Bernese mountain dog, which can be a very large dog.

Last December, Keifer weighed 130 pounds, and Cap knew she “had to get the weight off him for his health as well as to get the weight off his joints.”

By putting Keifer on weight management food and providing veggies as a snack he’s “now at the right weight of 115 pounds.

Two critical developments—a favorable court ruling in China and the U.S. launch of a next-generation product—are providing the foundation for what investors hope will be a sustained turnaround.

The company is taking strategic offensive action with the commercial rollout in the United States. After securing FDA approval late last year, Novo Nordisk has now begun selling an oral tablet version of its Wegovy treatment. This new format presents a significant competitive edge by eliminating the need for daily injections. Clinical trial data indicates it facilitates an average weight loss of 16.6 percent.

This launch grants the Danish firm a lead time estimated at two to three months before competing products, such as Eli Lilly's anticipated Orforglipron, are expected to enter the market. Priced aggressively at $149 per month, the oral Wegovy is positioned to target the broader consumer market.

Valuation Presents a Contrast to Competitive Pressures

The dramatic share price contraction over the past twelve months, which erased approximately 48 percent of the stock's value, has resulted in a fundamentally cheaper valuation. The equity closed the recent week at €44.61.

* The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio now stands near 14.15, well below its historical average of around 22.50.

* This valuation also sits at a discount to the broader healthcare sector average of 18.4.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Novo Nordisk?

Despite this apparent value, the competitive landscape remains intensely challenging. Rival Eli Lilly has recently captured market share at a faster pace with its product Zepbound. While Novo Nordisk reported growth of 12 percent in the third quarter of 2025, Lilly's revenue from Zepbound surged by 185 percent over the same period.

Legal Victory Strengthens Long-Term Position

A major catalyst for the current stabilization originates from Asia. China's Supreme People's Court has upheld the patent validity for the active ingredient semaglutide. This ruling is critical for Novo Nordisk as it fortifies the company's defensive ""moat"" against generic competition. Semaglutide forms the basis for the blockbuster drugs Wegovy and Ozempic; a loss of patent protection would have opened the door widely for copycat versions. Market analysts view this decision as a pivotal step toward securing long-term revenue in the crucial Chinese market.

For a durable reversal of fortune to take hold, the new oral medications must now rapidly generate measurable sales. Investor attention in the coming weeks will be squarely fixed on the execution of the U.S. launch and the first-quarter sales figures. Although the clarified patent situation and depressed valuation provide a base, the ultimate success of the new tablet will determine whether the prolonged downtrend has truly been broken.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422333_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:59:56.716653

A Disney actor turned animator turned game developer has just shared one of her favourite pieces of technical advice for achieving fluid animation, and it's a point she says is often overlooked (you might also want to make sure you're familiar with the Pixar rules of storytelling).

Libby Peterson is a former Disney and Pixar animator who worked on movies such as Lilo & Stitch. Stylised keyframe animation is her specialty. She's now working at Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light & Magic while also developing a K-Pop souls-like indie game in her spare time.

In the video above, she uses a character from her game to demonstrate the importance of extremes in animation. She says many people make the mistake of only focusing on key storytelling poses and breakdown poses, not on extreme poses.

An extreme pose is the furthest point that any part of a character's body touches. In a jump, for example, it would be the highest point the body reaches.

Libby points out that extreme poses naturally incorporate two of the 12 Disney principles of animation: arcs for natural-looking movement, and offset and drag to convey the impression of weight and mass.

""Focusing on your extremes and making sure each axis in both translations and rotation hits its extreme on different frames is what makes animation fluid,"" Libby says ""Also make sure the extremes of different parts of the body hit on different frames as well. Essentially this is how I think and approach animating drag and follow through and create arcs.""

It's vital to focus on individual rotations and forward and left to right movement and making sure they don't hit on the same frame, Libby says, otherwise, you get triangular janky movement.

The focus on extremes applies both to a pose-to-pose or a layered workflow, although Libby says it was when she was animating layered that the importance of extremes really clicked because animating one muscle mass at a time forces you to think about extreme poses and energy.

She recommends studying video reference to see where extremes naturally occur and then exaggerate them as needed for the desired animation style.

That could soon change.

The first drug discovered and designed using AI, Insilico Medicine’s Rentosertib, is likely to enter a Phase 3 clinical trial in the next 18 months, the final stage before seeking FDA approval. And it will reach that milestone in record time.

In the meantime, the coming year is sure to see a stepped-up pace of AI investments, deals, and partnerships by Big Pharma, venture capital firms, and biotech startups. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is investing more than $100 million of his own money in AI-based drug startups.

As a result, Precedence Research estimates that the global drug industry’s investment in AI will reach $2.51 billion in 2026 and $16.49 billion by 2034.

Fading into the background is the skepticism often heard at the start of 2025 about AI’s ability to have a significant impact on drug R&D. “We are really seeing AI being used across the board now,” said Samuel Scarpino, director of AI + life sciences at Northeastern University and an advisor to many biotech startups. “I don’t think we can point to a clear winner yet… but it is definitely producing a lot of value,” he said.

Pharma giant Eli Lilly is one of the industry’s leaders in adopting AI. In October, the company announced a partnership with Nvidia to build a powerful supercomputer to run an ""AI factory,"" powered by more than 1,000 super-powerful chips, which will be used to discover and test millions of potential medicines.

Lilly also just signed a deal with Insilico Medicine, potentially worth $100 million, to use the startup’s AI platform to jointly identify and develop new therapies. Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer of Lilly. says the company is encouraging every employee to incorporate AI into their work. ""I don't believe any other company in our industry is doing what we do at this scale,” he said.

Rau does acknowledge that “there is still a ton of hype out there,” but predicted that an AI-discovered drug could reach the market by 2030. “AI is doing very, very well at discovering new molecules” that can be turned into drugs, he says.

The end of the decade may seem like a lengthy timeline, except that it typically takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new drug, at a cost of $2 billion and up. Just getting to the point where a drug can be tested in humans can take a minimum of 4 to 5 years, and nine out of 10 drug candidates never make it that far.

That’s why there is so much interest in Insilico’s Rentosertib — it went into human trials in less than two years, a blistering pace for the industry.

Insilico, based in Boston and Hong Kong, was founded in 2014 by Alex Zhavoronkov to take advantage of an AI platform he co-developed to replace animal testing. Rentosertib is its first drug candidate, a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic and deadly lung disease with no known cure that kills about 40,000 people each year in the United States.

In June, the company announced that Rentosertib improved lung function with few side effects in a phase II study of 71 patients, clearing the way to start a larger phase III trial. Though the drug could still fail, “I don’t want to play down this accomplishment,” says Northeastern’s Scarpino. “The typical time frame for drug development has been dramatically shortened. This could be a game changer.”

Venture capital investors are betting on such an outcome. According to a November Pitchbook report, VCs invested a total of $2.7 billion in AI drug development firms through the first three quarters of 2025, even while overall investment in biotech startups slowed. The funding difference illustrates the “frenzied AI investment environment and investor conviction in the ability of AI integration to drive greater R&D efficiency,” PitchBook said in its report.

Although drug researchers have been using early forms of AI for decades, excitement over the technology’s ability to speed R&D came with the introduction in 2020 of AlphaFold2, an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs that made it possible to predict the three dimensional structure of some 200 million biological molecules. It’s creators were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024, and the model has been used by more than 2 million people from 190 countries.

Lilly’s Rau cautions that AI is a long way from replacing researchers, although it will shift the roles humans will play. And it has a limited role to play in human trials. “We are still limited on how long it takes the biology to work.” he said. “The clinical trials will still take years and years.”

Nevertheless, a recent survey of people working in biopharma by Endpoints Signal, a division of the Financial Times, found that 48% of respondents describe themselves as heavy AI users. And though only 15% of those surveyed said AI is doing transformative work in research and development today, three-quarters expect AI to transform the drug discovery process by 2030; 12% think the change will come as soon as three years.

One of the biggest proponents of AI in drug R&D is Altman; the OpenAI CEO invested $180 million three years ago to seed Retro Bio, which is partnering with OpenAI to develop drugs that can ""reverse age-related diseases."" Keeping with Silicon Valley's longevity fixation, Retro’s ambitious goal is to add a decade to the lifespan of healthy humans.

Retro is currently in the process of raising a $1 billion round of funding. The company is also about to start the first human trial for an Alzheimer’s drug it developed, in Australia.

OpenAI is also backing Chai Discovery, founded a year ago, that completed a funding round of $130 million in December, doubling its valuation to $1.3 billion. The company said its AI models are already generating drug-like molecules with high success rates, “Looking back over the last five to 10 years, there’s been so much hype on AI for drug discovery,” co-founder and CEO Josh Meier told Bloomberg. “This is the year things started working.”","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2189638602.jpg",N,,2026-01-04 09:03:17.298064

It's been a year since Bristol Live announced that the 'biggest change to Bristol' is coming - the biggest since the aftermath of the Second World War - and most people don’t know too much about it. But is the transformation of Bristol under way already, and what has happened in the past year?

The change involves a huge swathe of the city, from St Pauls, across the M32 to St Jude’s, Lawrence Hill, St Phillips, Temple Meads and around to Bedminster, is on the cusp of being transformed so much, it will be unrecognisable to Bristolians in just five years’ time. That area forms an inner city arc of industry that's clearly visible from space, in between the city centre and the Victorian terraces of the residential city beyond.

And the transformation raises huge questions which are so far going largely unanswered about where people in a city like Bristol work, what kind of jobs they have, where they live and what kind of homes they have? The transformation has its origins in decisions taken ten or more years ago, and is already starting to get underway.

Most of Bristol already know that major change is coming to the city centre - with Broadmead, the Bearpit and the Galleries seeing a huge amount of development heading its way in the next few years. But this is even bigger than that, will affect more people, a larger area and have even more impact.

After the war, those in charge of rebuilding a bombed-out city took the opportunity for a complete change. The tightly-packed terraced streets that ringed the east and south east of the city centre were cleared away, the residents were generally sent to live in new communities of council estates on the outskirts of the city, and a new Bristol was born - a network of dual carriageways and huge roundabouts, industrial estates, warehouses and factories ringed the city centre.

This was city planning on a grand scale. The idea was that people would live in nicer, modern homes with gardens in places like Hillfields or Knowle, and commute in to work in the industry of Bristol’s inner core, in the factories of Bedminster’s Malago Road, the heavy industry of St Philips Marsh or Lawrence Hill and the industrial estates of St Jude’s.

It was a vision that has lasted about 60 years - until now. For now, the post-war inner city industrial estates are being, or about to be, swept away even more quickly than they were created. Every other week during 2024 and 2025 seemed to see a new major planning application trouble the city council’s planning department, or a new consultation launched by a large-scale developer. Where is this happening - the list is a long one. Let's start at the northern tip of this inner city industrial arc.

St Pauls

In St Pauls, an entire area of the city from St Nicholas Road to Portland Square was originally terraced homes, and schools. Victorian maps show long-lost terraced streets with forgotten names - Lake Street, Cabot Street, St Lawrence Street. They were cleared and factories built close to the M32 motorway. Now, that industrial area has gone too, and plans for hundreds of new homes to fill in the gaps have been proposed for a long time.

St Judes

On the other side of the River Frome and the great divide created by the M32, St Jude’s is about to change fast. St Judes has long been a warren of warehouses, factories and storage yards, ever since the post-war planners cleared the terraced slums and replaced them with low-rise industrial buildings.

But there’s now a plan agreed by the council for it to be transformed again, into something called the Frome Gateway. No sooner had the ink dried on the first draft than the developers were in, submitting planning applications for student flats and build-to-rent flats, a new bridge across the River Frome and the creation of a ‘vibrant’ new residential area.

That regeneration is now edging right up to the city centre itself - the owners of Cabot Circus unveiled plans for hundreds of student flats to be built between the shopping centre car park and the Newfoundland Way junction, earlier this year.

Lawrence Hill

Many of Lawrence Hill and Barton Hill’s terraced streets remained after the war, and those that were cleared were replaced by the vast 1960s council tower blocks that dominate the skyline here. Industry in the area was centred up and down the railway line, and dominated by the Bristol Wagon Works at the turn of the 20th century, which became the industrial estates that separate Lawrence Hill from Easton Road.

It’s early days for this, but there are proposals for thousands of new homes to be built on either side of the railway line to create a new part of Lawrence Hill.

St Phillips

Viewed from the air, St Philips is easily recognisable for the huge roofs of its warehouses and industrial units. It was always a tough place to live, with long lost Victorian terraced streets like Edward Street and Chapel Street bumping up against the rail yards, goods sheds and gas works. Between the railway and the Feeder, the people of the Dings have long been used to being surrounded by iron works and heavy industry.

But in the next ten years, St Philips is set to be radically transformed. It’s already happening the closer you get to Temple Meads station. If you want a vision of what this new long inner city arc of Bristol will be like in ten or 15 years’ time, take a stroll down Avon Street, where this transformation is nearing completion - a canyon of blocks of flats and student accommodation either side of a wide-pavemented road.

St Philips is part of the Temple Quarter regeneration scheme, a vast billion-pound project to replace the industrial landscape from Avonmeads to Temple Meads. Along the waterfront, and in pockets near Oxford Street it’s already happening, with student flats and a new university campus being created before the very eyes of the daily commuters into Temple Meads station.

And 2025 saw a major first step forward for this transformation - which is coming in the next ten years. The city council and the Temple Quarter bosses gave a first outline of what the area could look like, and consulted on different ways it will be shaped.

That feedback returned said one of Bristol's most iconic roads - Feeder Road, the long straight road on the south bank of the Feeder Canal - should one day be pedestrianised, as people rather than industry and car dealerships, live along it.

2025 saw some progress too on the north side of the Feeder. A couple of huge new student accommodation complexes neared completion, ready for the grand opening of Bristol University's new campus in September 2026. And work finally got underway to build the new Oasis Academy Temple Quarter secondary school.

East Bedminster

Across the river and further along the railway, there was once an area of Bedminster rich in history. Terraced streets called things like Weare Street, York Street, Nicholas Street and King Street were home for thousands of people, penned in by the railway line and the Totterdown and Victoria Park hill side to the south, the river to the north and surround by tanneries and the big Pylle Hill Goods Depot. It was out of these Victorian two-up-two-downs that Hillary Clinton’s great-grandfather grew up and eventually emigrated.

He started life on a terraced street that was cleared away by the Luftwaffe and the post-war slum clearers which, prophetically, was near Whitehouse Street. And this entire area was transformed in the 1960s into light industrial estates full of bodyshops, garages, automotive firms, printers and food manufacturers.

Now, it’s set to be transformed again. Two separate ‘development frameworks’ - one for the land to the east of St Luke’s Road and the other for the land to the west over to Bedminster Parade - have been developed, and the first plans for these sites are already being proposed. Nothing has started to be built yet, but it won’t be long.

Bedminster Green

At the southern end of Whitehouse Street is Whitehouse Lane, and another arm of industrial land that runs right into the heart of Bedminster, along the railway line. Either side of Malago Road, build-to-rent flats up to 16 storeys tall, and vast student accommodation complexes housing 819 students have already been built, and work on the second major student accommodation complex has now started. Even further south into Bedminster, empty builders' yards, car dealerships and now an empty printworks have or are proposed to be transformed into more flats or student accommodation.

Is the transformation stalling already?

Many aspects of this transformation of Bristol's 'inner-city industrial arc' are going ahead right on schedule and as planned. Where there is an economic driver in place, things are progressing rapidly. The opening of Bristol University's new Temple Quarter campus is prompting many Purpose Built Student Accommodation developments, both in the immediate area around St Philips and Temple Quarter, but also in the city centre and in Bedminster.

But 2025 saw something of a hiccup for the first time since the Covid pandemic, to the relentless march of Build-to-Rent flats and blocks of shared housing - prompted by a number of challenges facing the building industry.

The first is that new fire safety regulations state that any new residential building over 18m tall has to have two staircases - a legacy of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. That has seen developers go back to the drawing board with their plans for developments with more than seven or eight storeys - which almost all of them are.

READ MORE: Developers behind two tower blocks overlooking River Avon want to reduce affordable homes numberREAD MORE: There's already a row over plan for tallest building in South Bristol's history

And that has, the developers say, hit viability. If you have to include another staircase, that's less space for flats. Staircases don't pay rent but the lost 20 flats would. Then, there's the other regulations brought in as part of the Grenfell Tragedy changes. Many Bristol developments have become mired in bureaucracy and, with the costs of building spiralling, affordability issues.

Bristol's inner-city arc is full of developments that have been given planning permission, but have not seen any work - yet. One of the most high profile is the former Robins & Day Peugeot dealership, on the corner of the Bath Road Bridge roundabout opposite Temple Meads station. Across the river, something remarkable happened in 2025 to further highlight the stalling progress of the Bristol building boom.

A huge industrial estate, which Bristol City Council had drawn up plans to allow 900 flats to be built on, right in front of the famous Totterdown hillside, went up for sale. But developers wanting to get stuck into building those 900 flats to create the new 'Mead Street Framework' plan for flats within walking distance of Temple Meads and the new university, found themselves out-bid at auction by a landowner whose business is owning industrial estates.

Facing increased costs of building 900 flats, the residential developers couldn't commit to spending as much up front as the firm that wanted to keep it - for now, at least - as an industrial estate, with guaranteed rents and leases from the businesses already there. The Mead Street Regeneration part of the inner-city arc is currently on hold.

What kind of new homes are being created?

The Victorian expansion of Bristol that created the inner city from St Pauls to Bedminster ended up being the slums of the early 20th century. These were overcrowded shared terraced housing with outside loos, no bathrooms and often large families on just one floor or, worse, in one room. They were pulled down from the 1930s, bombed in the 1940s and cleared completely in the 1950s, to be replaced by the light industrial estates of the 1960s and 70s of factories and warehouses.

The new vision of housing back in the 1930s was places like Knowle, Sea Mills and Southmead - large, well-built homes with big gardens, bathrooms and central heating, followed by the likes of Hartcliffe, Lockleaze, Hillfields, Withywood, Broomhill and Lawrence Weston in the 1950s and 60s.

The third wave of Bristol’s housing boom will be neither of these, and it will be very different again. Instead of houses the boom of the 2020s and 2030s will be almost entirely flats - in blocks of between six and ten storeys and towers of up to 16, 17, maybe even 20 or 22 storeys high.

Instead of homes to buy with a mortgage, they will be almost entirely ‘build to rent’, providing an all-in-one package where everything from internet connection to water supply is covered by the rent.

The ‘build-to-rent’ phenomenon sees the developers building the blocks of flats also then continue to own them, collecting rent and dealing with maintenance of the shared areas. In the Bristol of the future, tens of thousands of people will live in ‘serviced apartment buildings’, where the level of service depends on the level of rent.

As well as ‘build-to-rent’, the new explosion of building also includes purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) and ‘Co-living’, although so far that’s a mode of housing that has so far been confined to developments in the city centre. Co-living is basically the same as ‘Build-to-Rent ’, but in shared flats that feel more like student accommodation.

The young Bristol resident of the second half of the 2020s and into the 2030s and beyond, will see the dream of buying their own home in the city go further and further away.

The PBSA and BtR combination leaves little scope for what is classed in planning terms as ‘affordable housing’. This could be anything from shared ownership to homes sold at a discount to teachers, nurses, paramedics or police officers, but in almost all cases it has been and will continue to be homes at a discounted rent.

That discount could be around 80 per cent of the rent charged on the open market, so-called ‘affordable rent’, or it could be ‘social rent’, which is normally much lower. In both cases, rented ‘affordable homes’ are taken on by a housing association and let to people on Bristol’s HomeChoice waiting list and bidding system.

How many of the new homes of Bristol’s third wave will be classed as ‘affordable’ has been a contentious issue. One of the first things Marvin Rees did as Mayor of Bristol - alongside scrapping rules which limited the height of buildings that could be built in the city - was to water down the requirements for developers to include affordable housing in their projects.

It was - and still, in theory at least, is - 40 per cent affordable homes in the city centre and 30 per cent outside the city centre. The developers told the Mayor and council chiefs that was a block to building more - the developers weren’t making enough profit to able to write off 30 or 40 per cent of their homes at a discount to a housing association.

A new bit of planning guidance in 2017 dropped that to 20 per cent, if the developers met certain criteria, and the developers have found this more favourable. At the time, the then Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said Bristol couldn't let 'the perfect be the enemy of the good', arguing that 20 per cent of something was better than 30 or 40 per cent of nothing. Now, pretty much most projects to redevelop Bristol’s industrial arc have 20 per cent affordable as standard - apart from student accommodation, where it’s not required at all.

So the new homes of the third Bristol boom will be flats in tower blocks, not houses in gardens; rented from a private development company, not bought with a mortgage and, in most cases, at the top end of rented accommodation in the city.

What will the impact be?

The most immediate and obvious impact is that tens of thousands of new homes will be created. What, if any, effect building thousands of new homes, albeit one and two-bed flats and student accommodation, will have on Bristol’s much lamented housing crisis has been and will increasingly be the subject of strong debate.

Those advocating for the shackles to come off the planning process and the widespread building of new homes - the self-styled YIMBYs - say building thousands of new homes will see rents and house prices fall for everyone else too. They also point to the building of densely-packed new homes on brownfield sites in cities as something which could take the pressure off the edge of town greenfield sites that environmentalists and those labelled NIMBYs are desperate to protect.

There are doubts however. Rents have continued to spiral upwards in Bristol despite the much-celebrated 12,534 new homes built in the period Marvin Rees was in office as Mayor. The price of buying a home, which spiralled in the 2010s, might have stopped spiralling, but is still out of reach of most young people, who struggle to find the rent each month let alone save for a deposit.

READ MORE: The 'co-living' boom about to hit Bristol - solution or problem?READ MORE: How affordable are the 'record levels of affordable housing' being built in Bristol

As stated, these will be almost entirely privately rented, or ‘Co-Living’ or student accommodation, so the idea that the third great transformation of Bristol will help the other aspect of the housing crisis - the people on the council’s housing waiting list - appears doubtful too.

With just 20 per cent of the build to rent homes - not including the student accommodation - classed as ‘affordable’, that is 2,000 new ‘council homes’ for every 10,000 new homes built in Bristol’s industrial ‘inner arc’. The city would have to built 100,000 to find a home for everyone currently on the waiting list - and that’s not including the people who need new council flats in the coming years as the first generation of 1950s and 60s tower blocks are almost certainly and eventually condemned.

The effects on jobs

The first industrial sites to be earmarked for the great transformation have tended to be empty factories and industrial units, but increasingly, the developers are coming for places where there are perfectly healthy businesses and jobs. These are businesses often on - at most - five year leases, but many have one or two year leases or break clauses. Companies do get notice, and often have contingency plans.

In Fishponds, the huge Graphic Packaging International site is set to be transformed into as many as 2,500 new homes after the firm itself decided to up sticks and move to a new site in Yate. On the banks of the river in Bedminster, the BART Spices factory, which delighted the nostrils of the people of Totterdown or Redcliffe depending on the wind that day, shipped off to Avonmouth, leaving their site for developers.",https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/article9829278.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Inner-industrial-arc.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:02:04.750291

During the investigation, whether they claim it was a gun, a hand grenade, or anything else, all of that will be examined. If anything like petrol bombs was used, it will come to light,"" G Parameshwara told reporters.

Earlier on Saturday, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar stated that ""Ballari was peaceful until BJP MLA Janardhan Reddy stepped into the district"", adding that ""the culprits of Ballari violence would be brought to justice.""

Addressing a joint press conference at Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's Home office, Krishna, Shivakumar said, ""There was no violence until Janardhan Reddy was allowed into Ballari. He doesn't have the right to talk about the violence. Our party will stand behind our MLA Bharat Reddy. The investigations will find out the culprits, and strict action will be taken against them."" Dismissing the BJP MLA Janardhan Reddy's statement that there was a conspiracy to kill him, the DCM accused Reddy of not being able to accept defeat, calling him ""a drama master.""

He said, ""He is a drama master. He is movie producer after all and it is natural for him to act. Who will try to kill a man who has a built a fort and has hundreds of security staff. In fact, the people of Ballari are worried. Reddy family is not able to digest the defeat in Ballari and hence they are making these accusations.""

The violence erupted during preparations for the unveiling of the Maharishi Valmiki statue at SP Circle in Ballari. (ANI)",,N,,2026-01-04 12:13:11.976342

Facing an astonishing projected cash hole of $17 billion and a fierce counterattack from Google's Gemini, Altman was forced to activate the ""Code Red."" On one hand, there is an unprecedented financing plan of hundreds of billions of dollars; on the other hand, there is a financial crisis with the inference cost exceeding the revenue. Is this the inevitable path to AGI, or is it the eve of the bursting of the biggest bubble in Silicon Valley?

Under the spotlight of Silicon Valley, Altman is riding a unicycle while juggling more and more balls.

The picture is generated by Nano Banana Pro.

For the helmsman of OpenAI, merely creating an all - knowing chatbot seems to be too conservative.

To keep the investors waving their checks and the audience excited, he has to continuously come up with new concepts: self - developed chips, e - commerce integration, corporate consulting, and even consumer - grade hardware designed by Jony Ive.

However, the admission fee for this show is becoming astonishing.

In 2026, for the fastest - growing unicorn in history, it is destined to be a thrilling ""match point.""

According to leaked financial forecasts, OpenAI is expected to burn through $17 billion in cash in 2026, up from $9 billion in 2025.

What's even more alarming is that this loss trend is expected not to converge but to continue to accumulate in the next three years.

This is like a game of Russian roulette with cash flow.

The Appetite of the Money - Guzzler

Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene at the end of 2022, OpenAI has raised more than $60 billion from investors, setting a record for private companies.

But Altman's appetite is far from satisfied.

According to a core source, OpenAI is planning a new round of financing in 2026, targeting a whopping $100 billion, which could push the company's valuation to an astonishing $830 billion.

In comparison, its valuation was around $500 billion in October 2025.

The list of potential major investors in this round is star - studded and complex: Amazon is in talks to invest $10 billion, even though it is Microsoft's arch - rival in the cloud; Nvidia has also hinted that it may invest $100 billion in batches, of course, on the condition that the money will eventually flow back to Jensen Huang's pocket to buy graphics cards.

Behind this unprecedented financing frenzy is equally unprecedented growth and consumption.

In 2025, OpenAI's revenue was reported to have reached $13 billion, and the annualized rate at the end of the year was heading towards $20 billion.

It took Google and Facebook five and six years respectively to reach this milestone, while OpenAI achieved it in just two years.

But the concern is that there is a tight ""chain reaction"" between OpenAI's revenue growth and computing power costs.

The company's computing power demand has soared from 200 megawatts in 2023 to 1.9 gigawatts (GW) in 2025.

To satisfy its future ambitions, OpenAI has even signed a letter of intent to increase its computing power capacity by 30 gigawatts in the next few years, with a bill as high as $1.4 trillion.

As a venture capital tycoon said, asking about the ""burn rate"" has even become a taboo at the financing negotiation table.

The leaked data depicts a terrifying future: by 2029, OpenAI may have burned through a cumulative $115 billion.

When asked by long - time supporter Brad Gerstner how to fill the funding gap equivalent to 100 times the 2025 revenue, Altman responded with his characteristic toughness: ""If you want to sell your shares, I'll help you find a buyer.""

The Crocodiles in the Moat

The reason Altman must maintain this high - intensity expansion is that the crocodiles outside the moat have come ashore.

Although Altman insists that the marginal cost of model training will decrease as the scale expands, the reality is that competition is forcing costs to spiral upwards.

Benchmark tests by Stanford's HAI Institute show that the performance gap between top - tier models is rapidly narrowing.

The Gemini 3 model released by Google in November has outperformed OpenAI's GPT - 5.1 in multiple indicators.

Although OpenAI quickly countered with GPT - 5.2, this counterattack was far from a decisive blow.

Meanwhile, open - source models are also closing in step by step. Like a pack of wolves, they are tearing at the territory of closed - source models.

This pressure has been transmitted to user data. Sensor Tower's monitoring shows that as of mid - December, ChatGPT had 910 million monthly active users, still far ahead of Gemini's 345 million, but the growth engine seems to be stalling.

A study by Deutsche Bank points out that in major European countries, ChatGPT's consumer subscriptions stagnated in the summer.

Realizing the crisis, Altman launched the ""Code Red"" operation in early December, suspending miscellaneous items and focusing on shoring up ChatGPT's moat.

What worries the management even more is that according to leaked Microsoft data, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI's inference costs (i.e., the cost of running the model to answer user questions) actually exceeded its revenue.

In other words, the more users use it, the faster the company loses money.

Performing or Selling Out

To fill the huge financial hole, OpenAI is becoming more and more like the traditional tech giants it once tried to disrupt.

That once - pure AI laboratory is now bowing to ""advertisers.""

Although the ""Code Red"" temporarily shelved the advertising project, insiders confirmed that advertising will definitely be implanted in ChatGPT in 2026.

Through partnerships with Etsy and Walmart, it is trying to turn the chat box into a cash register.

Meanwhile, OpenAI has started learning ""vertical integration"" from Google.

In addition to collaborating with Broadcom to develop custom chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia, Altman is also trying to replicate Android's channel success by collaborating with Jony Ive to develop consumer - grade hardware, attempting to open up new traffic entrances outside of the iPhone.

On the enterprise side, OpenAI has established a large consulting department and launched tools such as AgentKit, trying to poach more sticky enterprise customers from competitor Anthropic.

Although the consumer business is still the mainstay at present, the proportion of revenue from the B - side is rising.

Bubble or Singularity?

Is OpenAI now the inevitable path to super - intelligence, or is it another WeWork on the verge of bursting due to over - expansion?

A venture capital director who invests in a competitor unceremoniously compared it to a ""steroid - pumped WeWork,"" implying that it could collapse at any time under huge debt and unrealistic growth expectations.

If enterprise - level sales fall short of expectations and ChatGPT fails to find more efficient monetization channels, this multi - billion - dollar empire could quickly disintegrate.

Currently, the capital market has started to vote with its feet, and listed companies deeply tied to OpenAI have been punished in both the stock and bond markets.

But in the primary market, the madness continues.

Altman once said in an interview that one of the reasons he wants to take OpenAI public is to see the short - sellers get crushed. ""I'd love to see them burned.""

This most - watched tightrope walker in 2026 still believes he can reach the other side.

For onlookers, this big show is about to reach its climax in 2026.

In an era where computing power is regarded as a belief, so - called valuation is just the ticket people pay for ""believing in the future.""

And the promise of AGI is like the Golden Fleece hanging on the edge of a cliff, tempting the Iasons to take a desperate leap before being reduced to ashes.

This decline coincided with the implementation of a sweeping price increase across its product portfolio, leaving market participants to question the potential impact on customer loyalty.

Amidst the pricing strategy shift, the company is advancing its hybrid AI platform. Since early December, the Mistral Large 3 language model, featuring 41 billion parameters, has been integrated into the watsonx environment. This allows enterprise clients to utilize external models alongside IBM's own Granite systems, a move designed to offer flexibility.

In a more significant strategic play, IBM has announced plans to acquire Confluent for $11 billion. The deal, targeted for completion in mid-2026, aims to secure dominance in real-time data streaming technology, a foundational element for generative AI applications. This combination of aggressive pricing and strategic M&A underscores a clear corporate focus on high-margin business segments.

Widespread Price Adjustments Take Effect

Effective January 1, IBM instituted an average price increase of six percent for a broad range of software and hardware. Affected products include Passport Advantage licenses, monthly IBM Z subscriptions, and storage systems. Certain cloud services and legacy support for Power hardware saw even steeper hikes of up to ten percent. Furthermore, basic support for cloud offerings, previously included, is now a paid add-on.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Company management frames the increases as a necessary response to inflationary pressures and a measure to stabilize revenue per customer. However, the skeptical market reaction suggests concerns that this aggressive pricing may backfire. With many corporations currently scrutinizing IT budgets, cost-sensitive enterprise clients may be prompted to consider alternative providers.

Insider Transactions Signal Board Confidence

SEC filings disclosed late Friday indicate sustained confidence within IBM's boardroom. Three directors—Michael Miebach, Frederick H. Waddell, and Thomas Buberl—received shares on December 31 as part of their deferred compensation programs. These transactions directly align the board members' financial interests with the company's long-term stock performance.

All Eyes on the Forthcoming Earnings Report

The market awaits crucial answers from IBM's fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for January 28, 2026. This disclosure is expected to provide management's assessment of the revenue implications from the Confluent acquisition and, more immediately, reveal early customer reactions to the new pricing structure. From a technical analysis perspective, the stock is currently testing the psychologically significant $290 support level. A sustained break below this point could place additional downward pressure on its 50-day moving average.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422414_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:58:27.342302

""They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,"" Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider.
""Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future,"" a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider.
""Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.""
As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider.","From the outside, Saks Fifth Avenue — the century-old department store in Manhattan — is literally glowing, its façade decorated with thousands of glittering lights as part of its annual holiday display.

The shine, however, masks a retailer under pressure. On Friday, Saks named a new CEO, capping a tumultuous 12 months for the heavily leveraged department store owner. After months of restructurings, lawsuits, missed payments, and broken promises, Saks Global is now facing the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

What happens next could have consequences for customers. Brands — some of which haven't been paid in full for over a year — have paused shipments to Saks' stores, and creditors are awaiting news of its financial future.

In early December, Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, said it would no longer back shipments to Saks. The firm represents about 140 brands that sell to Saks — in the past, it's worked with big names like Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, and A.L.C. — and supplies the retailer with at least $500 million worth of product annually.

Hilldun's delay was expected to be short-lived, but shipments were still on hold as 2025 came to a close amid growing reports that Saks Global, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, was considering a court-supervised reorganization.

""They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,"" Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider. ""Every order is on hold until Saks clarifies to the industry what they intend to do.""

Saks itself hasn't negated the bankruptcy talk.

""Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future,"" a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider. ""Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.""

To succeed, Saks' stores must not only resolve their debt issues, but continue to offer the assortment of luxury clothing, shoes, handbags, and beauty products that have long made its stores shopping paradises.

As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider. ""They aren't going to have goods on the shelf, certainly not new goods. This is a house of cards — from a financial point of view, from a merchandising point of view, from a customer profile point of view.""

A match made in luxury hell

2025 was supposed to be a great year for Saks.

For more than a decade, the retailer, with its large physical footprint, had struggled to maintain its dominance as shopping patterns shifted, with customers turning to e-commerce or brand-owned outlets. It wasn't alone: Nordstrom was treading water before it was taken private, and Macy's has endured a drawn-out turnaround plan.

Its problems intensified following the pandemic, when inflation and economic uncertainty curbed discretionary spending. By 2023, it began to face challenges in paying vendors.

Then, at the end of 2024, Saks finalized its $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group, forming a luxury behemoth backed by the technology of Salesforce and Amazon, which took stakes in the new company as part of the deal. The move was seen as a solution to the beleaguered retailer's problems.

""It was touch-and-go up until the Neiman Marcus deal occurred,"" Wassner said. ""Everyone thought that would solve the cash flow problems.""

But the execution was messy.

The deal was financed by $2.2 billion worth of junk bonds — debt that carries high interest rates — which S&P Global called ""unsustainable."" It left the company strapped for cash, leading to a round of layoffs to start the year (multiple more would follow).

One of the first red flags for Saks arose on Valentine's Day, when vendors, who Wassner estimates are owed hundreds of millions, received an I-love-you-not from then-Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick.

He told them that they'd have to wait. Saks would pay its overdue bills — in some cases, more than a year past due — in installments stretched over 12 months that wouldn't begin until summer.

Vendors, some of whom were burned by similar communications prior to the 2019 bankruptcy of the iconic department store Barney's, were left between a rock and a hard place.

One vendor, who said he is owed six figures, called the situation ""agony.""

""We thought it was going to be a smoother transition and that this was going to be a global luxury masterpiece in the making,"" the person said. ""That just did not happen.""

Brands could withhold inventory shipments — which would risk ruining relationships with a core customer and put more strain on Saks' balance sheet — or continue business as usual and hope for the best.

Those who chose the latter were further disappointed in July, when the payment schedule wasn't met.

That month, Saks' financial vulnerability was made clear when a nine-figure interest payment prompted a debt restructuring. A majority of bondholders agreed to provide cash in return for being moved up on the retailer's cap table. Basically, meaning that if (or when) Saks files for bankruptcy, those bondholders get first dibs — likely before any vendors.

""I will say the biggest part of it has been the mental cruelty of this situation, waking up, not knowing what's going to happen, trying to keep things going,"" the vendor who spoke to Business Insider said.

A looming spring season

In the fall, things had dissolved to the point that several labels were withholding inventory.

S&P analysts wrote that Saks had a ""less-than-adequate in-stock inventory position."" In October, the company lowered its earnings guidance for the year, blaming inventory challenges.

""You are going to ship to somebody you know you're going to get paid from,"" Tim Hynes, the global head of credit research at Debtwire, told Business Insider. ""You will give Saks what's left, you're not going to give them the best.""

Some brands went even further, taking direct aim at Saks.

Skincare brand Sunday Riley said it threatened to sue if payments were not made, Retail Dive reported in August.

In October, Jovani Fashion, the dressmaker made famous by ""Real Housewives of New York"" star Luann de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against Saks Global — a rare step in a relationship-driven industry. Jovani said Saks owed $295,651 for merchandise it accepted this year. (Saks has denied wrongdoing.)

By the end of the year, murmurs of a potential bankruptcy filing made headlines. They intensified on the last day of the year, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Saks had missed a nine-figure interest payment, according to people familiar with it.

""It's time to solve the problems one way or another,"" Wassner said.

Bankruptcy isn't the only option. The company has billions of dollars in real estate that it can sell — it recently sold the land beneath its Beverly Hills location — and can close down unproductive stores, as it did with several Saks Off 5th locations and has floated doing with the Neiman Marcus in Dallas. The retailer's store names still hold cultural cache, and deep-pocketed investors could step in to enhance the shopping experience.

Cohen, the former Sears exec, doesn't expect Saks to close Bergdorf's or that famous Fifth Avenue location anytime soon, but there's still a long road ahead.

""They're not getting merchandise freely. They've had enormous upheaval in management. The luxury business, generally speaking, is not robust at the moment, and we're going into a year, 2026, which has all the makings of an honest-to- god recession,"" he said. ""Is there sunshine here? I don't think so.""

Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel, said in a recent interview that quantum computing will become popular within two years and accelerate the bursting of the AI bubble, and will completely replace GPUs before 2030. In his view, quantum computing, classical computing, and AI computing will together form the ""holy trinity"" of the future computing world.

On December 9th, QuantWare, a quantum hardware startup, officially released a new quantum processor (QPU) expansion architecture, VIO - 40K, and plans to achieve mass production of quantum chips in 2026. At its headquarters in Delft, the Netherlands, the company is actively building Kilofab - the world's largest and first wafer fab dedicated to quantum chip production. It is reported that this will increase its production capacity by 20 times compared to the current level.

At the beginning of 2025, Jensen Huang joked that ""quantum technology is at least 20 years away from practical application."" However, by the end of the year, the roadmaps of various quantum startups and giants were becoming more and more aggressive, and the predictions of the media and institutions also began to turn optimistic.

Undoubtedly, 2026 will be a crucial year for quantum computing to move towards practical application. And now is a good time to sort out the technology and review the market.

Let's first take a look at what happened in the quantum industry in 2025.

01 The Quantum Explosion in 2025

In 2025, the main players on the quantum stage can be summarized as: three tech giants, the ""Quantum Four"", and NVIDIA.

Google: After releasing the Willow superconducting quantum processor with 105 physical qubits at the end of 2024, Google officially announced the achievement of ""verifiable quantum advantage"" in October 2025. By running the ""Quantum Echo"" algorithm, the Willow chip was 13,000 times faster than classical supercomputers in processing out - of - order time correlator tasks. Experimental data further showed that as the scale of physical qubits increased, the logical error rate of the system decreased exponentially, verifying the effectiveness of the error - correction theory at the physical level.

In terms of the ecosystem, Google deepened its cooperation with NVIDIA, using the CUDA - Q platform for large - scale physical simulations to solve the noise design problems of next - generation processors. In addition, Google reached a cooperation with the UK National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), opening cloud access to the Willow chip for UK research institutions to support algorithm testing in fields such as materials science.

IBM: In 2025, IBM continued to implement its hardware iteration roadmap, focusing on improving processor performance and reducing the cost of the control system. In terms of hardware, IBM released and delivered a 120 - qubit processor codenamed ""Nighthawk"". This chip uses a new - generation tunable coupler, with a computing performance approximately 20% higher than its predecessor, ""Heron"". At the same time, IBM introduced an experimental chip called ""Loon"" to verify the stability of large - scale fault - tolerant components.

In terms of the engineering control architecture, IBM announced the results of its cooperation with AMD in October of the same year. The two sides used AMD's existing commercial FPGA chips to achieve real - time error - correction control of qubits. Tests showed that the processing speed of this solution met the requirements for real - time error correction, and the project progress was completed one year ahead of schedule. This progress demonstrated that general - purpose commercial chips can replace customized hardware for quantum control, which helps reduce the engineering cost of building fault - tolerant quantum computers and supports IBM's plan for fault - tolerant models in 2029.

Microsoft: In February 2025, Microsoft released its first quantum chip, ""Majorana 1"", based on topological superconductor materials. This product marked that Microsoft's long - term investment in the topological quantum computing route had entered the hardware prototype stage from theoretical research. Microsoft stated that the chip uses the characteristics of new materials to achieve immunity to environmental noise at the physical level. Although the current qubit scale is small, the release of this prototype verified the feasibility of the topological protection mechanism at the hardware level, providing an experimental basis for subsequent expansion.

The ""Quantum Four"" (IonQ, Rigetti, D - Wave, QCI): In 2025, listed quantum computing companies represented by IonQ, Rigetti, D - Wave, and Quantum Computing (QCI) underwent market integration and business adjustments. IonQ completed the acquisition of UK startup Oxford Ionics in June, involving an amount of approximately $1.1 billion, aiming to integrate ion - trap technology patents and expand the engineering team. Rigetti Computing continued to advance the modular deployment of superconducting systems and optimized the interconnection performance of the Ankaa - 3 processor. D - Wave focused on demonstrating the hybrid solving ability of quantum annealing technology in logistics scheduling and supply - chain optimization. In addition, Quantum Computing continued to explore in the field of photonics, aiming to lower the environmental threshold for system operation.

NVIDIA: In 2025, NVIDIA underwent a strategic correction in the quantum field. From doubting quantum computing at the beginning of the year, Jensen Huang publicly apologized at the GTC Summit in March and established the strategic position of quantum computing. Subsequently, NVIDIA quickly initiated capital operations.

In September, NVentures, a subsidiary of NVIDIA, continuously made significant investments in three technology routes within a week: participating in the nearly $600 million financing of Quantinuum (ion - trap), supporting QuEra (neutral atoms), and following the $1 billion Series E financing of PsiQuantum (photonic quantum). This combination of moves aimed to cover the mainstream hardware modalities through capital rather than self - developing QPUs.

At the GTC Conference in Washington at the end of the year, NVIDIA launched NVQLink, enabling direct communication between the QPU of quantum computers and GPUs. Jensen Huang pointed out that the QPU of quantum computing has received unprecedented support, and currently, 17 quantum computing companies and 8 US Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories have joined the NVIDIA ecosystem.

02 A Series of Highlights in 2026

Based on the technology roadmaps of major manufacturers and the predictions of industry analysis institutions, 2026 is regarded as a crucial node for quantum computing to move from engineering verification to utility verification. The industry's focus will shift from simply expanding the scale of physical qubits to verifying the quality of logical qubits and the actual deployment of hybrid computing architectures.

In the superconducting route, IBM has set 2026 as a crucial year to demonstrate ""quantum advantage"" in its plan. The company plans to use a ""quantum - centric supercomputing"" architecture to try to prove its cost or accuracy advantage over classical computers in specific scientific tasks. Its processor is expected to support deeper - level quantum gate operations (targeting about 7,500 gates) to run more complex algorithms. Google, on the other hand, faces the engineering challenge of transitioning from verifying error - correction principles to building long - lived logical qubits, focusing on further improving the coherence time and gate fidelity of physical qubits.

In the emerging routes, the neutral - atom manufacturer QuEra Computing has set the goal of releasing a system with 100 logical qubits; the photonic - quantum manufacturer PsiQuantum is accelerating the assembly of its ultra - large - scale systems in Chicago and Brisbane and is expected to enter a crucial system integration stage in 2026; and QuantWare has launched the plan for the Kilofab wafer fab, attempting to promote the industrial mass production of quantum chips. All of the above plans have high engineering uncertainties, and 2026 will be a test period to verify whether these aggressive goals can be achieved.

With the promotion of middleware platforms such as NVIDIA's CUDA - Q, ""Quantum - classical hybrid computing"" may become the standard deployment mode in data centers in 2026. QPUs will be more integrated as accelerators into high - performance computing clusters to handle specific simulation or optimization tasks. The popularization of this architecture will promote the combination of quantum computing and AI workflows, especially in the fields of large - model training optimization and complex molecular simulation. The industry expects to see more application tests based on hybrid computing power.

In the field of cloud services, IBM, AWS, and Microsoft currently provide quantum access services. In 2026, cloud providers may further integrate ""quantum + classical"" hybrid resources. The service model will evolve from providing single experimental hardware access to providing a hybrid computing environment integrated with high - performance computing resources. The threshold for enterprise users to call quantum computing power through the cloud platform to solve practical problems is expected to be lowered, but whether it can generate a positive return on investment in large - scale commercial scenarios remains to be seen.

At the security level, the US government is forcing the anti - quantum upgrade of digital infrastructure. According to the strategic deployment of the National Security Memorandum (NSM - 10), US federal agencies have entered the actual implementation stage of post - quantum cryptography (PQC) migration. The White House requires agencies to accelerate the phasing out of traditional encryption algorithms such as RSA and has set 2025 - 2030 as the critical window period for core systems to complete PQC upgrades. This initiative aims to establish the US's leading position in formulating the next - generation encryption standard and drive the reconstruction of defense systems in key fields such as finance and national defense.

This also reflects the fact that the quantum computing competition in 2026 will not only take place at the enterprise level but also between major countries around the world.

03 Countries Are Building Quantum Industrial Systems

Looking forward to 2026, as major global economies enter a new policy cycle, the development logic of quantum computing is undergoing profound changes. The focus of countries is gradually shifting from the early competition in single scientific research indicators to building a resilient industrial system and mastering the core links of the industrial chain.

The US strategic focus in 2026 has shifted to strengthening its internal industrial foundation. In response to the labor - force gap risk pointed out by the non - profit organization ""QED - C"", the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is expected to accelerate the cultivation of quantum industry clusters in places such as Colorado. Different from mainly funding basic scientific research in the past, the R & D budget orientation for the 2027 fiscal year shows that US policies are more focused on cultivating skilled technical workers and engineers and exploring new support models, including equity - for - capital, aiming to build a complete local industrial closed - loop from R & D to manufacturing to address the talent shortage in the fields of cryogenic electronics and microwave engineering.

2026 is the starting year of China's 15th Five - Year Plan, and quantum technology is positioned as a ""new economic growth point"" in the relevant planning suggestions, which implies that China's quantum industry is accelerating the transition from laboratory verification to industrial cultivation. At the infrastructure level, China's industrial community is exploring the integration of quantum computing into the national - level computing power network, relying on the ""East - West Computing"" project. China Telecom Quantum and Origin Quantum and other enterprises are expected to further pilot the ""integration of four types of computing"", namely quantum + supercomputing + intelligent computing + general computing, trying to use the real needs of public scenarios such as weather forecasting and power grid scheduling to drive technological iteration.

In terms of industrial chain construction, Chinese enterprises are committed to building a full - stack autonomous ecosystem. Manufacturers represented by Liangi Technology are promoting the R & D and verification of key components such as dilution refrigerators and special cables. At the same time, the photonic - quantum route is also being accelerated. Turing Quantum and other complete - machine manufacturers are exploring differentiated applications in the fields of AI and biomedicine, while Tengjing Technology provides solid underlying hardware support for this route through the R & D of precision optical components.

Europe and the UK are also accelerating the implementation of the ""technological sovereignty"" strategy. The UK has promised to continuously invest funds to support the quantum industry, relying on domestic enterprises such as ORCA Computing to build an internationally competitive industrial high - ground. The EU tends to support domestic companies in building quantum chip foundry facilities, trying to gain more say in the chip manufacturing link and build an industrial ""third pole"" with independent innovation capabilities.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260104/v2_d7c0fc1ecbf94f98a970f834b29d1781@5888275@ai_oswg1134118oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:58:38.014030

In the United States, retail CEO exits reached between 41 and 43 by late 2024, a more than 100% increase compared to the previous year. Similarly, in Mexico, at least nine major firms, including Walmart de México, FEMSA, and Grupo Bimbo, replaced their top leadership during the second half of the year.

“This period of CEO turnovers may seem like a coincidence, but each movement follows its own fundamentals. In reality, in Mexico we are accustomed to very long management trajectories, and that amplifies the perception of change. In any case, change is usually healthy,” says independent analyst Marcela Muñoz to El Economista.

Internal Promotion Trends

Boards of directors continue to favor internal candidates to provide cultural alignment and institutional knowledge. About 67% of CEO appointments across the S&P 500 in 2025 came from within the organizations, although this is a decrease from 74% in 2023 and 82% in 2022.

Major US retailers Walmart and Target both selected insiders for their top roles. Walmart appointed John Furner, the company’s number two executive, to succeed Doug McMillon. Furner and McMillon both began their careers at entry levels within individual stores. At Target, Michael Fiddelke was selected to succeed Brian Cornell in 2026. Fiddelke is a company veteran who oversaw logistics and sourcing.

In Mexico, several firms followed a similar path. At FEMSA, José Antonio Fernández Garza-Lagüera was appointed as part of a long-anticipated succession plan, as previously reported by MBN. At La Comer, Héctor de la Barreda took over as CEO, while his predecessor, Santiago García, moved to the Board of Directors. Roberto Solano, Manager of Analysis, Monex, says that these internal moves strengthen the ""core business"" as new leaders bring visions based on experience within the same company.

The leadership changes in Mexico coincide with a period of low economic dynamism. Data from the National Association of Self-Service and Department Stores (ANTAD) shows that accumulated sales grew 3.3% between January and September 2025, down from 4.6% in the same period of 2024.

Several high-profile appointments were confirmed in the final quarter of 2025:

El Palacio de Hierro: Éléonore de Boysson was named general director, becoming the first woman to lead the department store chain.

Macroeconomic and Regulatory Pressures

The new leadership teams face immediate regulatory and economic challenges. In Mexico, companies are preparing for labor reforms, including the gradual reduction of the work week from 48 to 40 hours by 2030 and significant minimum wage increases. In 2025, the minimum wage rose by 12% to MX$419.88 (US$23.48) daily in the Northern Border Zone and MX$278.80 in the rest of the country.

Retailers also face fiscal and trade pressures. Bottlers like Coca-Cola FEMSA are managing a MX$3.08 increase in the Special Tax on Production and Services (IEPS) for sugary drinks. Furthermore, department stores and supermarkets face proposed import tariffs of between 10% and 50% on products such as textiles, footwear, and electronics from countries without trade agreements with Mexico.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/charlesdeluvio-Lks7vei-eAg-unsplash.jpg?h=78d8cc56&itok=OieC8rKZ,N,,2026-01-04 09:03:32.499382

The question for 2026 is not whether AI agents will be regulated, but whether oversight will arrive before harm becomes normalized.","If 2025 was the year artificial intelligence became unavoidable, 2026 will be the year everyone starts talking seriously about AI agents.

An AI agent is a software system designed to plan and execute tasks autonomously, make decisions and interact with digital tools or environments with minimal human oversight in pursuit of a defined goal. When people fear that AI will take over jobs, they are usually worried about white-collar automation. The more immediate question is not what AI agents might do someday; it is who is pushing them now, and to what end.

Tech companies are aggressively marketing AI agents as autonomous digital workers that can plan tasks, execute goals and manage workflows with minimal human input. Corporate leaders echo these claims, framing agents as productivity multipliers and cost-saving measures.

In many cases, this enthusiasm reflects less a genuine breakthrough in capability than a familiar pattern: vendors racing to define the next category of enterprise software before regulators, workers or consumers have time to assess the risks.

The reality will be far less dramatic.

In 2026, AI agents will be everywhere in corporate decks and keynote speeches, but far less impressive in practice. Despite the hype, these systems remain unreliable and heavily dependent on human supervision.

They are not autonomous employees. They are closer to junior staffers who work quickly, confidently and often incorrectly, requiring constant review and cleanup. The problem is that Big Tech is pushing to deploy these agents at scale, often without adequate training, safeguards or clear human accountability.

That gap between promise and performance is already becoming visible. Studies and industry surveys consistently show that while AI tools are being rapidly deployed across private companies, few organizations are using them well.

Instead of boosting productivity, many firms report new inefficiencies: duplicated work, increased oversight burdens and time spent correcting AI-generated errors. In practice, AI systems often function less as productivity tools and more as justifications for cutting costs, shifting risk and lowering standards.

AI agents intensify this problem. Unlike chatbots that respond to discrete prompts, agents are designed to take initiative. They chain actions together and make decisions without constant human input. That autonomy is precisely what makes them appealing and risky. When agents hallucinate facts, misunderstand goals or act on flawed assumptions, errors cascade. For consumers, this can mean misinformation.

This is why trust remains the central barrier to agent adoption. AI agents cannot be trusted to operate independently in high-stakes environments such as finance, health care, legal services or government. They struggle with judgment and context, and they lack the institutional awareness humans rely on to navigate ambiguity. Yet, companies are increasingly positioning agents as authoritative interfaces, blurring the line between assistance and influence.

The result is a paradox. Companies invest in AI agents to reduce workload, but end up creating new layers of review and oversight. Employees must check outputs line by line. Managers must audit decisions after the fact. Compliance teams must anticipate errors, harder to trace because responsibility is split between humans and machines.

None of this means AI agents are useless. Like junior employees, they can be valuable when used appropriately. They excel at narrow, well-defined tasks. They can draft, summarize, organize and assist at scale. However, they are not ready to be trusted with end-to-end responsibility. Treating them as autonomous workers rather than tools is a category error that 2026 will make increasingly obvious.

By the end of 2026, the conversation around AI agents will begin to mature. The hype will cool. Executives will talk less about autonomy and more about supervision and ""co-piloting."" The most successful organizations will be those that treat AI agents not as replacements, but as trainees, useful only within clear boundaries and strong accountability structures.

AI agents may one day live up to their promise. But in 2026, they will still be learning the job.

Most importantly, if AI agents are deployed at scale, they must be governed as systems that shape rights, access and economic power — not treated as experiments run on the public. Regulators should require meaningful testing, clear lines of accountability and enforceable limits on how agents interact with consumers.

The question for 2026 is not whether AI agents will be regulated, but whether oversight will arrive before harm becomes normalized.

Estée Lauder also clearly pointed out in its financial report that many of its high - end perfume brands even achieved double - digit growth.
However, focusing on the high - end perfume raw material business, Givaudan increased by 18.7% year - on - year.
In December, the LVMH Group invested in BDK Parfums, a French niche fragrance brand.
For example, TSG, a consumer private equity fund, acquired Phlur, a niche high - end fragrance brand.","Amid the general slowdown of the global beauty market and the impact of geopolitics, L'Oréal acquired Creed, a top - tier salon fragrance brand under the Kering Group, for a sky - high price of 4 billion euros (approximately 32.82 billion yuan), revealing the most certain bet direction of the giants for the future.

In addition, in 2025, LVMH took a stake in BDK Parfums, and Estée Lauder made its first investment in a Mexican brand, XINÚ, in Latin America.

Behind the intensive layout actions of leading enterprises, on the one hand, it not only reshapes the competitive landscape of the global perfume market but also highlights the strong growth resilience of this category in the consumer wave.

On the other hand, in the corporate chessboard, perfume has been upgraded from an add - on category to a strategic stronghold for market competition. The competition logic is shifting from a stock game to the exploration of new growth.

Under the slowing growth, is niche high - end perfume the next breakout point?

Currently, although the perfume - related businesses from raw material suppliers to brand owners are still in a growth trend, the growth rate has significantly slowed down. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ""high - endization"" has become the key engine to resist cyclical fluctuations, contributing the most certain growth in the financial reports of giants.

As shown in the following figure, compared with before, Hermès and Coty, whose perfume businesses used to boost their performance, saw a year - on - year decline of 7.2% and 6% respectively in the third quarter of this year, in sharp contrast to the 9.3% increase in 2024. At the same time, the perfume business growth of L'Oréal, Puig, etc. also did not exceed 3%, indicating a significant weakening of growth momentum.

Even so, many enterprises said that their high - end perfume brands achieved considerable growth, becoming highlights of their performance. Among the strategic brands of the Shiseido Group's Next5, the perfume brands Issey Miyake and Narciso Rodriguez increased by 16% and 13% year - on - year respectively. Estée Lauder also clearly pointed out in its financial report that many of its high - end perfume brands even achieved double - digit growth.

This is verified in the upstream of the industrial chain. Compared with the previous double - digit growth, international fragrance and flavor giants generally showed weakness in the first three quarters of 2025. Except for the slight increase in sales of Givaudan and IFF, DSM - Firmenich and Symrise declined year - on - year.

However, focusing on the high - end perfume raw material business, Givaudan increased by 18.7% year - on - year.

It can be seen that high - end perfume has stronger anti - cyclical ability and market attractiveness, which also provides clear guidance for the strategic layout of international beauty enterprises. In order to restart the growth engine, enterprises have increased their investment in perfume and focused their investment on this niche segment with still room for growth.

Led by L'Oréal, the perfume track remains hot!

Despite facing macro - level pressures, the global perfume market has a promising future. According to relevant data from Mordor Intelligence, the fragrance market was worth 76.71 billion US dollars (approximately 540.5 billion yuan) in 2025 and is expected to reach 112.46 billion US dollars (approximately 792.4 billion yuan) by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 7.95% during the forecast period.

Against this broad prospect, international beauty groups and upstream suppliers have accelerated their layout.

In 2025, there were over 10 investments in perfume and fragrance

In 2025, industrial capital represented by L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, and LVMH was particularly active. According to an incomplete statistics by Jumeili, there were more than ten investments and acquisitions of perfume brands globally. Among them, equity investment became the mainstream method, indicating that capital aims to establish long - term and in - depth strategic partnerships rather than simple financial investments.

Among them, L'Oréal's layout was the most coherent and aggressive. It successively invested in two high - end perfume brands within a month and also obtained the operation rights of the beauty and perfume of a fashion brand, quickly supplementing its high - end portfolio.

Subsequently, in October, through a historic cooperation with the Kering Group, L'Oréal brought Creed, a representative of high - end niche fragrances with a history of over 200 years, under its wing. This deal marked the ultimate layout of L'Oréal in the niche perfume field.

In addition, Estée Lauder and the LVMH Group also followed closely, but with different strategies, investing in perfume brands with strong regional characteristics and focusing on raw material quality respectively.

In November, Estée Lauder made a strategic minority equity investment in XINÚ, a niche luxury brand from Mexico, taking a fancy to its unique Latin American plant fragrance sources and cultural narrative.

In December, the LVMH Group invested in BDK Parfums, a French niche fragrance brand. This brand focuses on returning to the essence, emphasizing high - quality raw materials, adhering to handmade production, and conveying a unique artistic perspective and sensory narrative.

International luxury brands are keen to seize the differential value of the niche high - end fragrance track through equity investment, while upstream raw material giants tend to directly consolidate the supply chain and regional markets through acquisitions.

For example, Givaudan, a fragrance and flavor giant, successively acquired perfume and fragrance companies Vollmens Fragrances and Belle Aire Creations within three months to strengthen its position in the North American and Brazilian markets.

In addition to the above two groups eyeing the ""cake"" of perfume, many private equities and funds are also involved.

However, different from beauty enterprises focusing on single - category perfume brands, funds and investment companies are more optimistic about home fragrance brands close to daily life.

For example, TSG, a consumer private equity fund, acquired Phlur, a niche high - end fragrance brand. In addition to perfume, Phlur's product line also includes body sprays, hand creams, candles, etc.

Source: Phlur official website

Similarly, Homecourt, a high - end home fragrance brand founded by actress Courteney Cox, also received 8 million US dollars (approximately 56.337 million yuan) in Series A financing. Since its establishment in 2022, the brand's product line has expanded from the home field to body care and laundry products.

Behind these intensive investment actions, three core trends can be found:

Firstly, with limited growth in popular mass - market perfumes, capital is flowing more towards niche categories. In essence, against the backdrop of the fading traffic dividend, ""niche"" high - end perfumes with unique brand stories, rare fragrance types, and niche cultures have become the targets for giants to bet on the future and obtain differential value.

Secondly, the investment logic varies according to the nature of capital. Equity investments by beauty groups aim to complete the brand puzzle and acquire strategic growth points; acquisitions by raw material suppliers aim to control the core supply chain; while private equity funds prefer the extension of product lines for more stable returns.

Thirdly, scene - based consumption is expanding the boundaries of the track. Compared with traditional perfumes, home fragrances have a wider audience and product chain. Due to their higher frequency of use and stronger emotional value, they are attracting new capital to enter the market.

Investing up to 1.2 billion yuan in R & D factories

In addition to investing in promising perfume brands, international giants are looking upstream and focusing on building core capabilities at the R & D end.

Specifically, as a consumer goods giant, Unilever has not made new moves in investing in perfume brands, but in May this year, it invested 80 million pounds (approximately 753 million yuan) to build a new fragrance R & D facility in the UK. Two months later, it opened a new fragrance laboratory in the US. This series of actions shows that building independent and cutting - edge olfactory R & D capabilities has become a key part of leading enterprises in the industry.

In addition, from a geographical perspective, France, with its long - standing perfume history, has also become the best location for leading enterprises to build factories.

Chanel invested 150 million euros (approximately 1.241 billion yuan) to build a new perfume production base in France to consolidate its perfume industrial chain.

L'Oréal added an investment of 60 million euros (approximately 496 million yuan) to its Gosselies factory in northern France to provide strong manufacturing support for its perfume brands.

Estée Lauder opened a global perfume workshop in Paris, aiming to bring together top perfumers and creative talents to accelerate the innovation and commercialization of perfume art.

From the above, it can be seen that enterprises are no longer satisfied with acquiring ready - made brand stories but are directly investing in the source of creating stories. Meanwhile, future perfume competition is not only about competing for consumers' perception of a single product but also about upgrading R & D technology. Building higher technical barriers and stable production capacity supply has become the key bargaining chip for leading enterprises to consolidate their industry position and seize future growth opportunities.

The talent war: the key engine driving the ""olfactory economy""

Beyond strategic investment and supply chain layout, the upgrade of the talent structure has become a key move for leading groups to compete in the high - end perfume market.

In 2025, there were more than 10 changes in perfume business executives in the industry, from Hermès, the LVMH Group to Coty.

For example, in April this year, Creed, a brand under the Kering Group, appointed a former Estée Lauder executive as its CEO. It is reported that Nathalie Berger - Duquene has more than 20 years of relevant work experience and has held important positions in many international beauty enterprises such as Estée Lauder and L'Oréal.

Similarly, after emerging from bankruptcy, Revlon also poached a former Estée Lauder executive in October. It announced that Amber Garrison would serve as the President of the Elizabeth Arden brand and global perfume business. It is reported that Amber Garrison has rich experience in skin care, perfume, brand transformation, etc. and once served as the Global Brand President of Origins.

In addition, there were changes in the top management of niche perfume brands. For example, Marc - André Heller replaced the co - founder as the CEO of Memo Paris; Patrice Béliard took over as the CEO of niche fragrance brands Parfums de Marly and Initio Parfums Privés.

All of the above indicate that the current competition among leading enterprises in the ""olfactory"" field has reached a white - hot stage, and the competition in the perfume field has deepened from a game of capital and resources to a core competition of organizational capabilities and strategic thinking.

Although the competition is becoming increasingly fierce, it is certain that perfume will still be a category favored by most enterprises in the future. As Yan Ming, the managing partner of Xiuyuan Capital, also recognized the potential of this market. ""The fragrance field is still full of opportunities, especially fragrance products that contain cultural elements and can convey emotional value. Due to the emphasis on emotional value of such products, their growth process may be relatively slow, but once successful, they will also be more stable, and the two are complementary.""

Although the growth of single - category products purely centered on fragrance has slowed down, the integrated innovation of ""fragrance +"" has become the core model for exploring new growth.

As a sensory element, fragrance is being systematically integrated into categories such as skin care, household cleaning, and health care, creating composite products with both functional attributes and emotional resonance. In the future, the growth potential of the ""olfactory economy"" is expected to be continuously released.

Only one investment: is the Chinese perfume track facing a cold spell?

While international giants have occupied the headlines with their intensive capital actions, the Chinese perfume investment market in 2025 showed a ""calm"" on the data level. Public information shows that only EvoSensation, a new - style fragrance brand from Yunnan, completed its angel - round financing throughout the year, but neither the investment amount nor the investor was disclosed.

Looking back over time, most domestic perfume track investments occurred around 2022. Among them, the more attention - grabbing ones are Documents and Scentooze, which received investments from L'Oréal in 2022 and 2024 respectively, and Melt Season, which received tens of millions of yuan in strategic investment from the Estée Lauder Group in 2023. It is worth noting that the path for these three brands to gain capital recognition is to build an irreplicable high - end brand value centered on a unique oriental cultural narrative.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260104/v2_b86cb38e791c411a8d7cb75b046ea629@1743780481@ai_oswg1166121oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 01:58:04.109869

Three of the five — Amphenol, Alphabet and Reddit — have ties to artificial intelligence, which is expected to remain a major investment theme in 2026.

All five stocks are holding up despite a weak culmination to trading in 2025. The market generally rose Friday to start the new year, though software weighed on the Nasdaq. At the moment, IBD is recommending 60%-80% exposure, and these stocks to watch could be actionable soon.

Amphenol Among Stocks To Watch

Amphenol is forming a double-bottom base with a 143.48 buy point. Investors trying to get ahead of that entry can use the Dec. 26 high at 138.32. Shares traded just above that level Friday. Although shares have rallied more than 80% from the last breakout in May, the current base is still an early-stage pattern.

The company — Wednesday's IBD Stock of the Day — is riding at least two hot investing themes: data centers and aviation.

Amphenol makes interconnect products, fiber-optic connectors, antennas, sensors and specialty cables. Surging demand for data centers and the connectors for those operations has been a main driver of Amphenol's growth.

The company is a leader in high-performance connectors for military and commercial aircraft. Geopolitical tensions and airline demand for higher-efficiency planes are driving growth in those markets.

In addition, Amphenol has been on an acquisition spree, buying up AI infrastructure, defense electronics and industrial automation companies. Last year, Amphenol acquired CommScope's (COMM) connectivity business for $10.5 billion. In November, it closed the $1 billion deal for Trexon, a maker of high-strength cable assembly products for military equipment.

Amphenol will announce fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 28 after the close. Analysts expect earnings to climb 67% to 92 cents a share. Sales are expected to increase 42% to $6.131 billion, according to FactSet.

Earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for several quarters.

The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible. The stock has a moderate 21-day average true range (ATR) of 2.57%. The average true range, available on IBD MarketSurge, gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock's behavior. Stocks with a high ATR tend to make large price moves that can trigger sell rules. Stocks with lower ATRs tend to make more incremental moves.

Google Stock On Track For New Base

Alphabet shares are forming a flat base with a 328.83 buy point. It is the first new base to appear on the chart since the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at 197.95 in August. Shares briefly flashed an early entry on Friday, bouncing off the 21-day line, but pared gains. Friday's high of 322.50 can serve as a slightly aggressive buy point now.

The parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo and Gemini is still the No. 1 stock in the internet content industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. It has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Alphabet's earnings grew 36% in 2024 and are expected to have increased 32% in 2025.

The stock rose 65% last year thanks to its investments in artificial intelligence. But as the company continues to pour cash into AI, analysts now expect EPS growth to slow to 6%, to $11.24 billion, in 2026. Revenue is expected to grow about 14% in 2026 to $454.8 billion.

Google overhauled its search results in response to new competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT and others. As Alphabet seeks to remain a dominant player in AI, last month it announced plans to acquire Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy infrastructure company, for $4.75 billion in cash plus debt. Alphabet is also getting into quantum computing.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect fourth-quarter earnings to climb 32% to $2.63 a share. Sales are seen rising 15% to $111 billion.

Google stock has a mild ATR of 2.07%.

Evercore Another Stock To Watch

Evercore shares climbed past the 349.91 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on Dec. 22. But the breakout never got going. After fading at the end of 2025, shares reclaimed the buy point on Friday. Also, another handle entry has appeared at 353.30. Shares are holding above the 21-day exponential moving average, a positive sign while the stock tries to get traction.

New York-based Evercore — the fourth-largest investment banking advisor in the world — beat Q3 estimates thanks to strong M&A activity. Advisory fees jumped 49% to $290.7 million, mainly due to higher revenue from large transactions during 2025, the firm said.

Analysts believe the company is on sound footing for 2026 amid favorable conditions for wealth brokers and independent investment banks.

The firm has made the Middle East a focus of its expansion. In December, it received a license to work in Saudi Arabia. Evercore opened an office in Dubai in 2017 and also has operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia.

Evercore was founded in 1995 by Roger Altman, an investment banker who served as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury under President Bill Clinton. During the Jimmy Carter administration, he held another senior post at the Treasury. Altman remains senior chairman at Evercore.

Analysts' consensus earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $4.10 in earnings per share, an increase of 20.1%. Revenue is expected to climb 14.6% to $1.123 billion, per FactSet. The date of the report hasn't been announced.

Evercore has a 94 Composite Rating and an ATR of 2.88.

Stocks To Watch: Reddit Forms Bullish Pattern

Reddit stock is working on a cup-with-handle base. Shares are 3% away from the 246.15 buy point. The base shows a drop of 39% from peak to trough, which is deeper than usual. Yet, Reddit is no stranger to deep patterns. It formed a cup base from July to October 2024 and still nearly tripled from the buy point.

On Friday, RDDT stock broke a downtrend within the handle as well as a trendline from the top of the base, both offering early entries.

The online discussion platform monetizes its business mainly through advertising on its app and website. Daily active unique users were 116 million in the third quarter, an increase of 19% from a year earlier. Average revenue per unique user rose 41% to $5.04 in the quarter.

San Francisco-based Reddit grew earnings per share 400% in Q3, and analysts expect EPS to rise 159% to 93 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to jump 68% to $655.6 million, according to MarketSurge data.

Analysts Bullish On Reddit

Analysts are bullish on the company's 2026 prospects as posts from Reddit gain ground in AI-powered search results. Needham analyst Laura Martin on Monday said in a note to clients that Reddit is already generating over $100 million a year in fees from OpenAI and Google's Gemini, and the sum could double with Anthropic and Perplexity fees, TheFly.com reported.

Reddit settled litigation against Anthropic and Perplexity over use of Reddit content without a licensing agreement.

""As overall referral traffic shrinks, the platforms that AI answers cite (like Reddit) become increasingly valuable, we believe,"" the analyst said. Studies show Reddit is a ""key beneficiary"" of citations within answers generated through Google's AI overviews and ChatGPT, she added.

Earlier in December, Needham named Reddit its 2026 Top Pick and added the stock to the firm's conviction list. Piper Sandler and Jefferies also have named Reddit a top pick for 2026.

Reddit has a Composite Rating of 94 and ATR of 4.42.

Globus Medical Recovers From Decline

Globus Medical is forming a large cup-with-handle base with a 240.18 buy point, holding the 21-day line on Friday. The stock fell a steep 45% while forming the base, so the current five-week-old handle provides a pause that should help the stock break out successfully. Investors could use resistance around 90 as an early entry.

The stock recouped most of its decline on Nov. 7, when shares gapped up 36% on the company's blowout third-quarter report. Sales and earnings exceeded all analyst estimates, and Globus raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance.

Audubon, Penn.-based Globus makes products and surgical tools for joint reconstruction, spine conditions and other musculoskeletal ailments.

The company said growth in U.S. spine procedures drove much of its Q3 performance, and that momentum carried into Q4. Acquisitions also helped drive results.

Stocks To Watch: Globus Trends

In December, RBC Capital raised the price target on Globus Medical to 100 from 92 and kept an outperform rating. Analysts believe aging demographics, growing global health care access and differentiated innovation are driving momentum in the industry, TheFly.com reported. Globus is poised to deliver a solid year of sales growth.

At the same time, Canaccord raised the price target to 105 from 90 and kept a buy rating, citing bullish views for the medical technology sector in 2026 amid depressed valuations and growing deal activity, TheFly.com said. AI is changing the space, enabling improved patient treatments and surgical accuracy.

Globus Medical has a Composite Rating of 98, one of the highest in the medical products industry group. It has an ATR of 2.05% and is a stock to watch.

ID6,Barclays,2026-01-04 00:33:04+00:00,New York Post,"The Michael Porter Jr. challenge that Sean Marks, Nets face is a complicated one",Brian Lewis,,,,,https://nypost.com/2026/01/03/sports/michael-porter-jr-challenge-that-nets-face-is-a-complicated-one/,"Whether or not ailing Michael Porter Jr. is back Sunday to face the Nuggets team that traded him away, his absence has only underscored his importance.
With Porter, the Nets have been competitive — and at times, slightly better than that, winning seven of his past 10.
Now they’ll host the Nuggets at Barclays Center having dropped three straight and watched their tank get back on track.
That’s what they did with Porter, prying the Nuggets’ coveted unprotected 2032 first-rounder just to take Porter.
“Yeah, I love it here,” Porter said when asked by The Post if he sees himself in Brooklyn long term.","Whether or not ailing Michael Porter Jr. is back Sunday to face the Nuggets team that traded him away, his absence has only underscored his importance.

With Porter, the Nets have been competitive — and at times, slightly better than that, winning seven of his past 10. But without him, they’re 0-6.

Now they’ll host the Nuggets at Barclays Center having dropped three straight and watched their tank get back on track.

And despite Porter’s recent illness — he’s listed as probable after missing the prior two games — an increasing number of teams now are being connected to possible interest in the red-hot forward.

Porter is averaging a career-high 25.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists. He’s the only qualified player in the East mustering at least 25 points and seven boards and one of just five in the whole league, joining Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Lauri Markkanen and Deni Avdija.

At 27 on a rebuilding team, that makes Porter a walking inflection point.

A starter on Denver’s 2023 champs, is Porter more valuable as a foundation piece to build around, despite whatever spots his scoring costs the Nets in the lottery standings? Or is he more valuable as a trade chip before next month’s deadline, bringing back picks — and helping the Nets’ own selection by his departure?

These aren’t the only decisions general manager Sean Marks has to make, but they are among the most important — and the most pressing.

The Post reported in the summer that the Nets expect to have a two-year tank and step up in Year 3. Now, Jake Fischer of The Steinline wrote the Nets’ time frame could hinge on how they fare in the June draft, and that league sources expect them to start being aggressive following the draft, regardless of whether or not they trade Porter.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS

After being boxed into a corner by James Harden broadsiding them — and probably even before that — Marks values flexibility. He’s created just that, with the Nets leading the league in not only draft picks (32 total, 13 firsts — a dozen unprotected) but cap space ($15.5 million, up to $50 million this offseason).

They can use the latter to get more of the former, taking salary dumps before the trade deadline to land more picks. That’s what they did with Porter, prying the Nuggets’ coveted unprotected 2032 first-rounder just to take Porter.

Being salary-dumped is something Porter used as fuel en route to his career year.

“Yeah, I definitely use everything I can as motivation,” Porter said. “It was just so much noise about me as a player. I just felt like a lot of stuff was discredited because of the fact that it was a rough ending to my time there.

“I knew if I was healthy coming here, I’d be able to change the narrative around me.”

Porter has changed not just the narrative but his value.

After the trade was derided as one of the worst of the decade by Bill Simmons, now Fischer notes that a first-rounder and re-tradable salary may not be enough to get the Nets to flip Porter midseason.

The Clippers and Bucks have been linked with interest in Porter. Fischer reported that Milwaukee is evaluating Porter and adds the Warriors and Bulls, as well.

But the Nets have moved from sixth to fifth in the lottery standings, seeing their odds at one of the three elite prospects — Darryn Peterson, Cam Boozer or AJ Dybantsa — go up from 27.6 percent to 31.6 percent. They’re only 1 ½ games out of fourth, which would see that jump to 36.6 percent.

While moving Porter would aid their tank, the past few games have shown that spotting him rest days can do the same. And he clearly likes Brooklyn.

“Yeah, I love it here,” Porter said when asked by The Post if he sees himself in Brooklyn long term. “So whatever team wants and appreciates what I bring to the table, then that’s where I want to be. And I feel like they do here. … Like I said, if they want me here, I’d love to be here.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-u1hzhvso3-1767483623193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767465638&w=1200,N,,2026-01-03 20:59:30.643725

Zu verdanken sind die grünen vor allem zwei Neuigkeiten. An Silvester wurde bekannt, dass in China der Patentschutz für Semaglutid, der Wirkstoff von Wegovy und Ozempic, bestätigt wurde. Generikahersteller, die bereits mit den Hufen scharren, werden sich deshalb noch etwas zurückhalten müssen.

In den USA gab es kurz zuvor eine Zulassung für eine oral zu verabreichende Variante von Wegovy, also eine Abnehmpille. Jene soll noch im Januar auf dem Markt platziert werden und für frische Umsätze sorgen. Von einem großen Turnaround wird an der Börse zwar noch nicht geträumt. Doch die Börsianer gehen etwas leichtfüßiger ins neue Jahr.

Novo Nordisk kämpft mit der Konkurrenz

Dauerhaft leichter wird es für Novo Nordisk nicht unbedingt werden. In China mag man die Generikahersteller noch ein Weilchen länger auf Abstand halten. Ewig können die Dänen sich auf ihren Patenten aber nicht ausruhen. Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der Konkurrenzdruck im Westen kontinuierlich.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Novo Nordisk?

Ungewisse Aussichten

Das Jahr 2026 dürfte im Markt der Abnehmmedikamente noch für einige Überraschungen sorgen, die für Novo Nordisk voraussichtlich nicht immer angenehmer Natur sein werden. Das ist den Anlegern bewusst, weshalb die Reaktion auf die guten Neuigkeiten sich einigermaßen in Grenzen hält. Etwas verbessert hat die Ausgangslage sich für den dänischen Konzern.

This kingmaker capability — Taiwan Semiconductor deciding where the players stand in line — can ultimately decide the AI market’s winners and losers.","The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has expanded rapidly since 2023, powering applications from chatbots to autonomous systems and driving trillions in market value. Tech giants have invested heavily in data centers and specialized hardware to meet surging demand for training and inference tasks. However, constraints are emerging that cap this growth rate.

Supply chain bottlenecks, particularly in advanced manufacturing, limit how quickly new AI capabilities can scale. Power availability and component shortages further hinder expansion. It could be that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the key linchpins determining how far and fast AI expands.

Google’s TPU Cut Reveals Packaging Crunch

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has reportedly reduced its 2026 production target for Tensor Processing Units from around 4 million to 3 million units. According to a report by Korea Economic Daily, this adjustment stems from limited access to Taiwan Semiconductor’s CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, which Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) secured through priority allocations. CoWoS integrates processors with high-bandwidth memory on a silicon interposer, essential for high-performance AI accelerators. Without sufficient capacity, finished chips cannot deploy at scale. Other outlets have reported on production caps previously.

Taiwan Semiconductor dominates CoWoS technology, but explosive AI demand has outpaced its expansions. Nvidia has locked in over half of its available capacity through 2026 and 2027, leaving competitors like Google constrained. This forced Google to cut its production target despite strong internal needs for its custom silicon.

The issue underscores how supply allocation now influences the AI hardware landscape more than design or demand alone.

Battle for the Production Line Shapes AI’s Future

Chipmakers and designers are competing intensely for positions in Taiwan Semiconductor’s production queue. Google’s experience highlights this scramble, where securing advanced packaging determines output volumes. Nvidia’s dominance in allocations gives it an edge in scaling AI accelerators, while others face delays.

This dynamic parallels energy constraints limiting data center buildouts. Power grids struggle to support massive, expanding AI infrastructure, capping expansion opportunities. Yet Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing controls the core components inside those centers, from logic dies to packaged accelerators. Its role as the primary foundry for leading-edge nodes makes it central to AI progress. Without its capacity ramps, even abundant energy would not translate to deployable hardware.

Taiwan Semiconductor is accelerating capacity expansion through 2028, doubling its advanced wafer capabilities. It is also repurposing 200 mm fabs for advanced packaging, which could increase its returns. If fully utilized, it would not be surprising to see revenue double by 2028.

Potential Lift for Intel’s Foundry Ambitions

Yet the CoWoS shortage could end up boosting the competition, which moves in to fill the void created. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for example, is aiming to rival Taiwan Semiconductor in foundry services. Google has explored alternatives like Intel’s EMIB packaging for future TPUs, such as the v9 accelerator expected around 2027. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also is said to have placed orders with Intel, while Apple could tap Intel’s 18A process for its entry-level M-series chips starting in 2027.

The foundry’s focus on custom ASICs and advanced packaging puts it in step with industry needs for efficient AI compute. Its 18A and 14A nodes, plus EMIB, position it to capture business from hyperscalers seeking alternatives. Intel is scaling its New Mexico facility’s capacity by 30% for EMIB and 150% for Foveros, its own advanced 3D packaging technology.

Yet Nvidia reportedly reviewed and passed on using Intel’s facilities, though both Google and Apple are reportedly also sounding out Samsung‘s two facilities in Texas to meet their needs. Samsung is offering advanced packaging as a “turnkey” solution bundled with DRAM and foundry services to hyperscalers such as Google, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

So, while Taiwan Semiconductor remains dominant, its capacity issues create openings for its competitors to gain traction and, in Intel’s case, validate its turnaround strategy.

Key Takeaway

While Nvidia seems to have the inside track on commanding priority, boosting its long-term dominance in the space, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is increasingly the key to whether other chipmakers and designers thrive. As advanced packaging becomes the new industry bottleneck, its CoWoS capacity can determine who scales compute.

Delta Air Lines has AC power outlets at most seats. But that doesn’t mean all your devices should be powered. A short video shows a woman seated in Comfort+ extra legroom economyusing a curling iron to curl her hair inflight.

Commenters seem to argue that “curling irons are banned” but usually mix up whose rules apply. TSA doesn’t restrict plug-in curling irons. They’re allowed in carry-on and checked bags.

Cordless curling irons may be restricted – such as if they contain lithium batteries or (apparently this is a thing, I had no idea) if they’re gas or butane fueled. Those are going to be limited to carry-on bags (but they’re still allowed through the checkpoint).

None of that means you can use a heating appliance on board. Just because you can bring it on doesn’t mean you’re permitted to use it. Or that it’s a reasonable idea to primp and preen with a hot curling iron, going section by section through your hair throughout the flight.

Delta’s rules do not specifically mention curling irons. They allow hair dryers and straighteners when packed properly but I don’t know that anyone actually envisioned whipping this tool out and using it onboard. Their Contract of Carriage, though, does say they can refuse to transport and remove passengers who fail to obey crewmember instructions or if their behavior is hazardous, creating a risk of harm or unreasonably annoying others. So it’s really crew discretion.

Of course, we’ve seen passengers whip out a full-sized iMac to work in coach, plug in a power strip at their seat to charge multiple devices at once, and my personal favorite, bring out a sewing machine to spend the flight making curtains.

The UK’s manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in 15 months in December, as the impact of uncertainty about the autumn Budget and the Jaguar Land Rover cyber attack began to fade, a new survey shows.

The S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey, watched closely by economists, showed a reading of 50.6 in December, up from 50.2 in November.

Any reading above 50.0 indicates that activity is growing while any score below means it is contracting.

Manufacturing output increased for the third month in a row and the level of new orders for firms rose for the first time since September 2024, according to the survey.

Some businesses benefited from conditions improving at the turn of the year having come under pressure from challenges in parts of the market.

This includes those across the supply chain affected by production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after the British carmaker was impacted by a major cyber attack at the end of August.

The incident was linked to a drop in overall motor manufacturing during September.

Sentiment also showed signs of improving since the autumn Budget at the end of November, which provided some certainty over tax and policy measures impacting the UK’s industrial sectors.

Demand within the UK was the main driver of growth in new orders for manufacturers last month, with intakes of new work from overseas contracting for nearly four years.

However, the rate of decline in new export businesses was mild, with UK firms pointing to signs of recovery in demand from the US, the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions last month.

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “The domestic market remained a positive spur to growth, while new export business, despite having now fallen for almost four consecutive years, took a sizeable stride towards stabilising.

“UK manufacturers benefited from several reduced headwinds towards the end of the year, as the negative impacts of the uncertainty surrounding the autumn Budget, tariffs and the JLR cyber attack all moderated.

“The start of 2026 will show if growth can be sustained after these temporary boosts subside.”

Mr Dobson said the drivers of growth need to “shift more towards rising demand” and away from firms clearing backlogs of work.

Employment within the sector also fell for the 14th month in a row, but at the slowest rate since the period of job shedding began.

Chris Barlow, head of manufacturing at accountancy and advisory firm MHA, said its clients are expecting hiring to continue to slow in 2026 and are “instead looking to find ways to work more efficiently, often by automating or improving their processes”.

He added: “Government measures, such as the confirmed increase to the minimum wage, alongside the impact of the salary sacrifice cap, are making businesses cautious about hiring new staff.”

He also said improving demand in the UK would be “vital for manufacturing’s prospects in 2026 given the path ahead for global trade is not expected to get any easier”.",http://nation.cymru/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01JK5KC3HQQ63DK4ADPT4Z9H7Y.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 03:58:55.365777

On December 24, the chip giant announced a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq, an AI inference chip company founded by former Google TPU engineers, covering its inference technology. The deal is reportedly valued at $20 billion, with Groq expected to generate $1.4 billion in revenue in 2026.

But the deal involves more than just the tech. As part of the transaction, Groq founder Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and additional team members will join Nvidia to support the advancement and scaling of the licensed tech. Ross, who will serve as Nvidia’s Chief Software Architect, previously helped build and scale Google’s TPU before co-founding Groq with other Google engineers in 2016. Groq will remain an independent company, and its GroqCloud developer platform, which provides API access to Groq’s LPUs, will keep on operating without interruption.

Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter sees the move as potentially transformative. In his view, Nvidia isn’t just adding another tool to its arsenal – it’s opening the door to a different way of thinking about AI computing altogether.

“With the deal,” says the analyst, “NVIDIA is embracing a fundamentally different processing architecture that we believe will eventually be integrated into its roadmap.”

Groq’s architecture differs fundamentally from GPUs. Its LPU (language processing unit) processors use deterministic spatial dataflow, executing operations in a fixed sequence. As a “classic example,” Buchalter compares the two architectures to factories: an LPU is like a high-speed, purpose-built assembly line, while a GPU resembles a busy factory where a manager gives tasks to workers.

An LPU is designed to make AI inference faster, more consistent, and more energy-efficient. To do this, it relies on a smart compiler that carefully plans exactly when and where each calculation happens and how data flows through the chip. In simple terms, the chip itself stays simple, while the software does all the hard work.

Groq’s LPUs are built specifically for AI inference, with Buchalter believing they are not aimed at the training market. The analyst thinks that Nvidia’s adoption of an inference-focused chip – and a new architecture – highlights how “large and mature” low-latency inference has become. Previously, AI infrastructure investments tended to prioritize training, under the logic that training chips would later serve for inference.

“This is unsurprising as the industry has indicated an increasing portion of revenue coming from inference,” Buchalter further said, “but NVIDIA’s licensing deal with Groq likely signals the inference market has scaled to the point where inference-only procurement is an increasingly material portion of the market.”

To this end, Buchalter sticks with a Buy rating on NVDA shares, assigning a $235 price target that implies ~24% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here)

Meanwhile, the broader analyst community is even more optimistic. The Street’s average price target of $262.79 suggests 39% upside, and with 39 Buys against just one Hold and one Sell, Nvidia carries a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See NVDA stock analysis)

Should you buy the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing?","Creating an efficient and versatile smart home setup is a worthwhile endeavor, especially for those who work, workout, stream, game, and play at home. With so many services, gadgets, and smart devices, it can be tricky to make sure everything fits together seamlessly and easily.

I was taken aback when I first set up the LG Smart Monitor Swing, a device that looks to have a lot of functionality and versatility, in part because it's not static. The monitor swing is built on wheels and designed, it seems, for those who do a lot of different things online at home. Someone like me. I tested out this exciting gadget for a few weeks, and here's what I discovered.

Price, availability, and specs

This compelling product comprises a 4K touchscreen monitor and an adjustable rolling stand. The 31.5-inch monitor features UHD resolution, HDR10, and a 60Hz refresh rate. The monitor includes three HDMI ports and two USB ports; one of each cable is included with the unit.

The stand features wheels so that you can roll around the unit, and the arm allows for adjustments to height. You can also tilt and swivel the monitor, and rotate it from landscape to portrait orientation.

Some assembly is required; the pieces are a bit heavy and cumbersome, but a single person can put them together on their own in a relatively short amount of time.

The monitor swing stand is available from LG, Amazon, and Best Buy. It retails for $1,300, but has been found on sale for up to $500 off.

What I like about the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing

Highly versatile for work, play, and everything in between

There's a lot that this clever device does fairly well, and overall it makes for a helpful tool for someone who does a lot of different things with a screen at home. Notably, this monitor features LG's webOS, which grants you easy access to entertainment, gaming, lifestyle, and productivity apps.

Due to its size, it works well as a screen for streaming titles for an audience or one or maybe two, while also making it more than suitable as a large space for work. The HDMI and USB ports are quite handy; I used the monitor as an extension of my laptop, adding efficiency to my work day. While it can do a lot, the creation of a bigger workspace is probably the biggest draw for me as someone who works at home and does a lot of writing and connects remotely with others.

One of the main appeals of the stand is its ability to move and adjust with ease based on your needs. The wheels move fairly easily, jsut make sure you don't have anything blocking the path, because the unit in all is quite heavy. The height can be adjusted within reason, while the monitor can tilt and swivel as well. Perhaps the most fun is that the screen can be rotated from a landscape orientation to a portrait one, which can be useful in a lot of circumstances, including when casting from your phone.

A remote is included, and it resembles current smart TV models; it's durable, small, and laid out with efficiency. It includes buttons to jump to apps as well as different inputs. I found I wasn't using the touchscreen element as much as I initially thought; it's helpful in certain cases when working or sharing media, and I'm certainly happy it exists, I just didn't use it a ton.

The design is fairly clever too; the white aesthetic is neutral and accommodating, while the base features a removable lid that cleverly houses and consoles the power adapter.

What I didn't like about the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing

Screen quality and features don't serve faithful entertainment

While the Smart Monitor Swing can do a lot of different things for you throughout your day quite well, it's not really superb at most of those things. It casts a wide net of uses but is more a generalist than a specialist. Its 60Hz refresh rate and HDR10 compatibility, for example, mean it's not going to give you the action blockbuster or cinematic movie experience you'll get with a high-end TV. The monitor is not a TV screen either; the image is worthy, with quality color, but sharpness, brightness, and contrast are not going to be up to the standards of even a mid-range smart TV.

There is no battery for the monitor swing. You must keep the power adapter plugged in at all times while using, so be mindful when moving and setting up the stand.

You can connect your gaming console or enjoy cloud gaming within webOS. However, it's not ideal for serious online gamers. The refresh rate, along with a 5ms response rate, mean you're not set up with ideal circumstances for competitive online play. Ports offer HDMI 2.0 connections, but not HDMI 2.1, so you won't be getting the most out of either top gen console.

Lastly, glare is common on the screen, so you'll need to be mindful of ambient lighting and what you're watching. The glare was definitely noticeable during the daytime, and can be seen easily in several pictures I took. Lastly, it's worth noting the device has speakers, but they are not worth using, which isn't particularly surprising. With Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and HDMI connection options, there are plenty of alternatives to the built-in speakers.

Should you buy the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing?

There's certainly a lot of value to be had here provided you both appreciate the many possibilities of the monitor swing and accept its limitations. It will likely serve you best as a unique companion for work and creative endeavors, with appeal coming from its size, adjustment ability, and connectivity options. It can also supplement more casual entertainment consumption, playing games and watching titles where fidelity and visual components aren't as important.

I found a lot of uses. I enjoyed a much bigger monitor for my work space, a secondary screen that has sports on in the background, and a sizable space to share photos and videos from my phone. I rolled it into the kitchen to watch holiday movies while baking, and used it as a large personal tablet to do some shopping. After all of that, it's a product I realize I don't want to be without.",https://static0.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/12/lg-smart-4k-monitor-swing-11.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-03 16:58:42.961302

The pharmaceutical giant’s stock is trading at record levels, buoyed at the start of the year by a fresh upgrade from analysts. However, this optimism is not solely based on past performance. Aggressive price reductions in China and promising clinical trial data suggest the firm is aiming to solidify its leadership in the weight-loss medication market.

A key driver of recent news flow is the company's operational strategy. Just before the turn of the year, Eli Lilly confirmed it had cut prices for its blockbuster drug Mounjaro in China. Market observers interpret this as an aggressive play to capture market share in the world's second-largest economy.

The objective appears clear: by prioritizing volume over margin, Eli Lilly aims to pressure rival Novo Nordisk and its product Wegovy. This tactic is designed to deeply embed Lilly’s GLP-1 therapies in the Asian market, even if it temporarily weighs on profitability.

A Vote of Confidence from the Analyst Community

Institutional confidence in the company's sustained growth trajectory was underscored on Saturday, January 3, 2026, when Zacks Research upgraded Eli Lilly shares to a ""Strong-Buy"" rating. The stock had closed the previous Friday at $1,080.36, marking a new 52-week high.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Eli Lilly?

This upgrade comes during a period where Eli Lilly has already demonstrated impressive performance. With a gain of over 42% on a 12-month basis, the company has outpaced many competitors in the healthcare sector. The long-term bullish sentiment is further confirmed by institutional investors like CMH Wealth Management, which recently expanded its holdings.

Pipeline Holds Promise with Oral Candidate

Another critical factor for future prospects lies in the company's clinical pipeline. Recent Phase 3 trial data for the drug candidate Orforglipron, from the ""ATTAIN-MAINTAIN"" study, have shown promising results. This compound represents an oral alternative to the injectable treatments currently standard.

Developing an effective pill is considered a major goal in the weight-loss market, as it would appeal to patients averse to injections. Should Eli Lilly secure regulatory approval for an oral therapy ahead of its competitors, the total addressable market could expand significantly.

Looking Ahead

Investor focus now shifts to the quarterly earnings report expected in early February. A key consideration will be the extent to which international price reductions impact margins and whether the robust revenue growth—approximately 54% in the third quarter of 2025—can be sustained. From a technical perspective, the new ""Strong-Buy"" rating could provide the necessary catalyst for the shares to test the $1,100 level in the coming trading week.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422033_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 12:13:22.612180

Eli Lilly & Co. is no longer just a blue-chip pharma name buried in retirement portfolios. Over the past few years, ""Eli Lilly & Co."" has effectively become a flagship product in its own right: a tightly integrated platform of obesity, diabetes, neuroscience, and oncology therapies that’s rewriting the rules for what a modern pharmaceutical powerhouse looks like.

The hype around Eli Lilly & Co. is anchored in a very real problem: global metabolic disease. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are ballooning into trillion-dollar public health crises, overwhelming healthcare systems and shortening lives worldwide. The company’s GLP-1–based treatments, led by its blockbuster obesity and diabetes franchise, have moved from niche therapeutics to cultural touchstones cited in earnings calls, political debates, and even celebrity interviews.

That shift has turned Eli Lilly & Co. from a conventional drug maker into a category-defining product ecosystem. Its medicines aren’t just therapies; they are becoming infrastructure for how health systems, insurers, and patients think about weight management, cardiovascular risk, and chronic disease prevention.

Get all details on Eli Lilly & Co. here

Inside the Flagship: Eli Lilly & Co.

When investors, clinicians, and regulators talk about Eli Lilly & Co. today, they’re really talking about a product portfolio anchored in one dominant theme: using metabolic and biologic innovation to rewrite the standard of care. The company’s core offering is no longer a single molecule but an integrated platform spanning obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and chronic disease management.

At the center of this is Lilly’s GLP-1 and incretin-based franchise for obesity and type 2 diabetes, which has rapidly become the company’s spiritual equivalent of a ""flagship device"" in the pharma world. These drugs, which modulate hormones involved in appetite, insulin secretion, and energy balance, have delivered startling levels of weight loss and metabolic improvement in clinical trials and real-world use.

What makes Eli Lilly & Co. so product-centric now is how this flagship franchise connects to a broader pipeline:

Metabolic disease platform: The company is evolving beyond one-off obesity drugs into a recurring, combination-based model. Newer molecules and next-generation incretins are designed to improve efficacy, boost tolerability, and expand treatment to earlier stages of metabolic dysfunction. This resembles a tech roadmap more than a traditional one-and-done pharma launch.

Cardiometabolic outcomes: Lilly is running large outcomes trials to show hard benefits beyond weight loss — including reduced cardiovascular events, improved kidney outcomes, and long-term risk reduction. If these data continue to hit, Lilly’s products don’t just compete with rival drugs; they cannibalize entire procedural categories like bariatric surgery and some interventional cardiology.

Neuroscience and Alzheimer’s disease: In parallel, Eli Lilly & Co. is building a second, high-risk, high-upside product pillar in neuroscience, with a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease. Disease-modifying treatments targeting amyloid and related pathways could rapidly become some of the world’s most valuable drugs if efficacy and safety profiles hold.

Oncology and immunology: While less in the spotlight than obesity, Lilly’s oncology and immunology assets form a critical diversification layer. These products give the company resilience if any single category faces regulatory pushback, reimbursement tension, or safety controversies.

Strategically, Eli Lilly & Co. behaves increasingly like a platform technology company. It invests heavily in:

Data and real-world evidence: Using outcome data, claims, and long-term follow-up to strengthen its value proposition with payers and governments.

Manufacturing scale as a feature: Capacity has become a product differentiator. Lilly is spending billions to expand injection and drug-substance manufacturing so it can meet surging demand and avoid the shortages plaguing the GLP-1 category.

Patient and provider experience: Through support programs, digital tools, and co-pay assistance, Lilly is making its therapies feel more like an end-to-end product experience than a simple prescription.

In other words, Eli Lilly & Co. is less a static portfolio of molecules and more a constantly iterated suite of health technology products, updated with fresh clinical data and production scaling the same way a cloud platform adds features and regions.

Market Rivals: Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie vs. The Competition

Eli Lilly & Co. doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Its most intense rival in the current cycle is Novo Nordisk, while longtime diversified peers like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson compete from different strategic angles. A few products define the battlefield.

Novo Nordisk and the GLP-1 showdown

Compared directly to Nova Nordisk’s Wegovy (semaglutide for obesity) and Ozempic (semaglutide for type 2 diabetes), Eli Lilly & Co.’s metabolic platform is the benchmark that investors and clinicians constantly measure against.

Efficacy: Trial data across the GLP-1/incretin class show high levels of weight loss for both Wegovy/Ozempic and Lilly’s obesity/diabetes therapies. However, Lilly’s next-generation incretin combinations have been positioned to offer more robust weight loss and metabolic control in certain patient groups. This has turned clinical comparisons into a quasi-spec war, with each new dataset treated like a product launch event.

Dosing and adherence: Both companies offer injectable formulations, often once-weekly. The race is on to deliver more convenient dosing schedules, better tolerability, and easier patient onboarding. Novo Nordisk has made early moves on oral semaglutide, while Lilly is exploring formats aimed at improving real-world adherence.

Supply chain: Wegovy and Ozempic have faced repeated supply constraints as demand exploded. Eli Lilly & Co. has faced its own bottlenecks but is investing heavily in additional manufacturing capacity. In this market, the company that can simply keep pharmacies stocked often wins prescriptions — and mindshare.

Pfizer: a rival searching for a metabolic foothold

Compared directly to Pfizer’s developmental obesity and diabetes programs, Eli Lilly & Co. looks more like a mature, fully shipped product than a roadmap. Pfizer has pursued oral obesity drug candidates and GLP-1–adjacent mechanisms, but has struggled with setbacks, safety questions, and trial discontinuations.

Time-to-market: Pfizer is years behind the Lilly–Novo duopoly in regulatory approvals and commercial infrastructure for obesity therapeutics. That delay gives Eli Lilly & Co. crucial first-mover advantages with prescribers and payers.

Brand and outcomes data: While Pfizer is a trusted name in vaccines and cardiovascular drugs, it lacks a flagship obesity product in mass clinical use. Eli Lilly & Co. is already building a dense network of real-world data and outcomes evidence that will be difficult to dislodge.

Johnson & Johnson and the diversified defense

Compared directly to Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen portfolio, Eli Lilly & Co. stands out as more concentrated on high-growth metabolic and neuroscience categories. J&J remains a diversified healthcare conglomerate with strength in medical devices and oncology, but it lacks a comparable GLP-1–driven obesity franchise.

Risk vs. resilience: Johnson & Johnson offers stability through diversification, while Eli Lilly & Co. concentrates risk and upside in a few massive therapeutic categories. For patients and payers, Lilly’s focus means sharper innovation; for investors, it means higher volatility and higher potential returns.

Across this rivalry landscape, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie has become shorthand for owning a leading slice of the obesity and diabetes revolution — analogous to holding a dominant cloud provider in the early days of enterprise SaaS.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

So why does Eli Lilly & Co. currently outmuscle its rivals in perception, prescription, and valuation? Several structural advantages stand out.

1. A category-creating flagship

In tech terms, Lilly’s GLP-1/incretin franchise is its ""iPhone moment"" — a single family of products that redefines the category and then spawns an ecosystem around it. Instead of endlessly following patent cliffs with me-too drugs, Eli Lilly & Co. has created a highly differentiated platform that:

Delivers transformative weight loss for many patients, not just incremental change.

Targets multiple endpoints (weight, glucose, cardiovascular risk) with a single therapeutic strategy.

Anchors an expanding line of follow-on products and life-cycle extensions.

2. Execution at industrial scale

In modern pharma, manufacturing and supply reliability are as much a feature as efficacy. Eli Lilly & Co. is aggressively expanding its production footprint, pouring billions into new facilities and contract manufacturing. That industrial build-out is a competitive moat: it’s hard for latecomers to match both the clinical performance and the physical supply chain.

3. Data as a force multiplier

Lilly’s strategy leans heavily into real-world evidence and long-term outcomes trials. This data-rich approach does two things:

Strengthens the company’s hand in negotiations with insurers and national health systems, which increasingly want proof that weight loss translates into fewer hospitalizations and events.

Builds brand durability with clinicians, who grow more confident prescribing therapies backed by large, longitudinal datasets.

4. Focused but diversified pipeline

While obesity and diabetes dominate headlines, Eli Lilly & Co. has built credible second pillars in neuroscience and oncology. That gives the company:

Hedge potential if pricing pressure or political scrutiny hits obesity drugs.

Optionality to create new flagship products — especially in areas like Alzheimer’s disease, where even modest efficacy can have enormous commercial and societal impact.

5. Strong pricing power and payer appeal

Unlike many older drugs trapped in a race-to-the-bottom generic pricing cycle, Lilly’s newest products sit at the premium end of the spectrum. But because they can reduce downstream costs (fewer complications, fewer procedures), insurers are increasingly willing to pay. That combination of premium pricing and cost-offset justification is a recipe for robust, sustained margins.

In sum, Eli Lilly & Co. wins right now because it behaves less like a slow-moving incumbent and more like a high-growth product company, constantly iterating and scaling around one core thesis: that metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases can be meaningfully re-architected with modern biology.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The transformation of Eli Lilly & Co. into a product-centric growth engine has been vividly reflected in Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie (ISIN: US5324571083).

According to real-time market data from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch accessed shortly before publication, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie was trading at approximately USD 775–785 per share, with a market capitalization well above USD 700 billion. Both sources indicated that the stock has delivered strong double-digit percentage gains over the past 12 months, significantly outperforming major indices like the S&P 500 and most pharmaceutical peers. The pricing and performance data referenced were based on the latest available intraday quotes and, where applicable, the last official closing price.

This valuation is not being driven by legacy products; it is a direct vote of confidence in Eli Lilly & Co. as a high-growth product platform anchored in its obesity and diabetes franchise. Several dynamics are in play:

Revenue growth from GLP-1 and incretin-based products: Sales of Lilly’s metabolic therapies have become the primary growth engine, with analysts attributing a majority of recent top-line expansion to this category. Multi-year demand projections remain aggressive as obesity treatment shifts from niche to mainstream.

Pipeline-fueled optionality: Investors are assigning substantial value to pipeline assets in Alzheimer’s disease, oncology, and next-generation metabolic drugs. Each positive trial readout or regulatory milestone is treated like a major product launch, adding layers of optionality on top of already-strong sales.

Multiple expansion vs. peers: Eli Lilly & Co. trades at a premium earnings multiple compared to more diversified peers such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Markets are effectively rating Lilly less like a mature pharma and more like a growth technology company with recurring revenue characteristics driven by chronic therapies.

Risk factors priced in, but not dominant: Concerns about political scrutiny over pricing, reimbursement caps, and long-term safety monitoring for obesity drugs are real. However, the current valuation suggests investors believe the structural demand and health-economic benefits of these therapies will outweigh policy friction.

For now, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie functions as a pure-play expression of the market’s belief in the future of obesity and diabetes treatment.

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-03 14:51:45+00:00,NAI 500,Why Billionaire Investor Peter Thiel Sell Nvidia and Buy This AI Stock Instead? | NAI 500,"Caroline Kong, Author: Caroline Kong",,,,,https://nai500.com/blog/2026/01/why-billionaire-investor-peter-thiel-sell-nvidia-and-tesla-and-buy-this-ai-stock-instead/,"As of September 30, Thiel had completely exited his position in Nvidia and significantly reduced his Tesla holdings from over 272,000 shares to just 65,000 shares.
Data shows that Thiel held over 537,000 shares of Nvidia at the end of Q2, but by the end of Q3, he held none.
Nvidia is the “shovel seller” of AI hardware and computing power, while Microsoft is transforming into the “builder” and “enabler” of the AI ecosystem.
Through platforms like Azure and GitHub, Microsoft connects developers, enterprise customers, and AI model providers, building an increasingly robust AI ecosystem.
In 2026, as AI moves from technological exploration to scaled deployment, Microsoft’s ecosystem advantages are expected to amplify further.","According to the 13F filing submitted by his hedge fund, Thiel Macro, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Silicon Valley legendary investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel executed a notable portfolio adjustment in the third quarter of 2025. As of September 30, Thiel had completely exited his position in Nvidia and significantly reduced his Tesla holdings from over 272,000 shares to just 65,000 shares.

Known for his forward-looking insights into technology trends as the first outside investor in Facebook, Thiel did not redirect the proceeds from these sales into non-tech sectors like industrials or healthcare. Instead, he made substantial purchases of Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), initiating a position of nearly 50,000 shares in Microsoft and increasing his stake in Apple. This contrarian move reflects his unique perspective on the evolving landscape of the AI industry.

Thiel’s third-quarter adjustments garnered significant attention on Wall Street. His decision to fully exit Nvidia appeared particularly bold against the backdrop of a global AI frenzy, with Nvidia’s stock price continuing to climb as a core provider of computing power. Data shows that Thiel held over 537,000 shares of Nvidia at the end of Q2, but by the end of Q3, he held none. Simultaneously, he reduced his Tesla position by more than 76%. These moves sent a clear signal: Thiel likely believes these high-flying leaders may have already priced in near-term expectations.

It is worth noting that Thiel’s investment in Microsoft has been volatile. He held no Microsoft shares in Q4 2024, built a position of nearly 80,000 shares in Q1 2025, sold all of them in Q2, and then bought nearly 50,000 shares again in Q3. This back-and-forth confirms his ongoing re-evaluation of Microsoft’s value. As of early January 2026, Microsoft’s stock price had declined about 6% since September 30 and was down roughly 2% from June 30. If Thiel remains bullish on Microsoft’s prospects, the current price may represent a more attractive buying opportunity than when he initially purchased.

The core reason Thiel chose Microsoft over continuing to bet on Nvidia lies in their different positions within the AI industry chain. Nvidia is the “shovel seller” of AI hardware and computing power, while Microsoft is transforming into the “builder” and “enabler” of the AI ecosystem. Microsoft’s unique advantage is its “neutral platform” positioning. Unlike companies developing large language models entirely in-house, Microsoft chose to strategically invest, acquiring approximately a 27% stake in OpenAI, and deeply integrated its ChatGPT into the Copilot product, spanning the entire Office suite, Bing search engine, Windows operating system, and other software.

More importantly, in its cloud business, Azure, Microsoft has adopted an open strategy. Enterprise customers can choose from various large models like Anthropic’s Claude, xAI’s Grok, China’s DeepSeek R1, and Meta’s Llama for application development. This “non-aligned” ecosystem strategy allows Microsoft to avoid technology roadmap risks and positions it as a core beneficiary of the AI software trend.

This strategy is already showing early results. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, ended September 30, 2025, Azure revenue grew by a staggering 40% year-over-year, becoming Microsoft’s fastest-growing business segment. The strong performance of the cloud business validates the core value of Microsoft as an AI infrastructure platform.

Looking ahead to 2026, Microsoft’s opportunities in the AI field will revolve around three key dimensions. First is the continued expansion of Azure. As global enterprises accelerate AI deployment, demand for flexible, scalable cloud platforms is surging. Microsoft’s multi-model support strategy allows it to meet the diverse needs of different enterprises regarding cost, performance, and regional compliance, simultaneously enhancing customer stickiness and platform value.

Second is the accelerated monetization of AI products. AI assistants like Copilot are transitioning from value-added features to core productivity tools. As user habits form and features iterate, subscription revenue from AI add-on services will become a new growth engine. Microsoft, with its dominant position in the enterprise software market, possesses the most direct path to commercialization.

Finally, there is the network effect of the ecosystem. Through platforms like Azure and GitHub, Microsoft connects developers, enterprise customers, and AI model providers, building an increasingly robust AI ecosystem. This ecosystem advantage will form a strong competitive moat; even if individual model technologies iterate, Microsoft’s value as a platform player will continue to grow.

Peter Thiel’s portfolio adjustment is, in essence, a forward-looking judgment on the distribution of value within the AI industry. He is not pessimistic about the AI trend but rather believes value is shifting from the hardware layer to the platform and application layers. With its neutral platform positioning, deep enterprise customer base, and complete cloud-to-end product matrix, Microsoft is favorably positioned within this value shift. In 2026, as AI moves from technological exploration to scaled deployment, Microsoft’s ecosystem advantages are expected to amplify further.

For investors, Thiel’s moves offer a key insight: during waves of technological change, the long-term value of infrastructure and platform builders may be more resilient than that of short-term technology leaders. When the market cheers for a particular technology, calmly seeking the next link in the value chain may be the key to achieving excess returns.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AI-chips.png,N,,2026-01-03 09:59:32.784188

Još jučer zvučalo je kao šala: serumi s puževom sluzi postali su obavezan korak u kupaonicama diljem planeta. A onda je TikTok eksplodirao, izazovi su postali viralni, a mali korejski brend CosRX preko noći je postao globalno ime. Danas ga posjeduje Amorepacific, najveći kozmetički div u zemlji. Ovaj ludi uspjeh savršeno pokazuje koliko je K-beauty narastao: od internetske znatiželje do industrije koja guta tržišta i diktira što ćemo mazati na lice.

Brojke koje zvuče nestvarno: K-beauty postaje ekonomska sila

Dok se ostatak svijeta tek prilagođava, u Južnoj Koreji K-beauty je već dugo ozbiljan biznis. Domaće tržište u 2024. procijenjeno je na oko 13 milijardi dolara, a pojedine kategorije rastu dvoznamenkastim stopama. No pravi šok stiže izvana: u prvoj polovici 2025. Južna Koreja je prestigla Francusku i postala drugi najveći svjetski izvoznik beauty proizvoda, odmah iza SAD-a. K-beauty je tako ušao u klub najvećih, i to bez kočenja.

Hallyu efekt: kako su K-pop i K-drame pogurali K-beauty do vrha

Nije slučajno da je K-beauty postao opsesija baš sada: dio je korejskog vala, poznatog kao Hallyu, koji je K-pop i K-drame pretvorio u globalni fenomen. Rezultat? Police svjetskih trgovina imaju cijele odjele posvećene korejskim proizvodima, od Sephore do Walmarta. U isto vrijeme, pretražite “Korean skincare” i dobit ćete lavinu sadržaja: “unboxing”, analize sastojaka, “Get Ready With Me” i naravno “glass skin”. To je K-beauty na steroidima.

Formula uspjeha: inovacija brža od svih i trendovi koji pale internet

Srce priče je brzina. K-beauty lansira nove formule svakih nekoliko mjeseci, često dizajnirane da postanu sljedeća viralna opsesija. Nekad su rutine od deset koraka, “water sleeping mask” ili sastojci poput “salmon sperm” zvučali nišno i odbojno. Danas su normalni. Proizvod iz Seula može istog dana završiti na feedu u SAD-u, UK-u, Indiji i Australiji. No stručnjaci upozoravaju: stalna izloženost sadržaju o njezi kože može povećati tjeskobu i potaknuti pretjeranu potrošnju.

K-beauty ulazi u rat divova: kupnje, preuzimanja i kopiranje sastojaka

Veliki igrači osjećaju miris novca. L’Oréal je krajem 2024. preuzeo korejski konglomerat s brendom Dr.G, ciljajući potražnju za učinkovitim, ali pristupačnim proizvodima. U isto vrijeme, zapadne kompanije ubacuju “korejske” sastojke u svoje linije: centella asiatica, rižina voda i sve što obećava mirniju, mladolikiju kožu. U Koreji dominiraju konglomerati, takozvani chaeboli, a Amorepacific drži oko polovice domaćeg tržišta. K-beauty više nije samo trend, to je bojište.

Tvornice koje rade kao sat: kako K-beauty izbaci hit-proizvod u šest mjeseci

Da bi nahranili potražnju, Koreja ima oko 30.000 beauty brendova i industrijski ekosustav koji izgleda kao znanstvena fantastika. Ključnu ulogu imaju ODM proizvođači koji rade istraživanje, formulaciju i proizvodnju za tisuće etiketa. Cosmax, jedan od najvećih, opskrbljuje oko 4.500 brendova i 2024. je činio više od četvrtine korejskog izvoza kozmetike vrijednog 10 milijardi dolara. Zahvaljujući automatizaciji, put od ideje do prodaje može trajati samo šest mjeseci. To je K-beauty brzina koju Zapad teško prati.

Cijena ludila: tisuće propalih brendova i pritisak na transparentnost

Iza glamura stoji brutalna istina: konkurencija je toliko žestoka da su marže tanke, a propasti česte. Prema državnim podacima, više od 8.800 kozmetičkih brendova ugasilo se posljednjih godina. Influenceri sve više traže dokaz učinkovitosti, porijeklo sastojaka i manje praznih celebrity reklama. Kupci, kažu, više ne gledaju samo ime, nego sastav i rezultate. K-beauty se zato mora stalno dokazivati: ne samo da bude viralan, nego i stvarno djelotvoran.

Undoubtedly, Michael Burry has bearish bets against both AI darlings. But he’s got more exposure to Palantir puts than Nvidia, likely because of the even hotter valuation and the potential for coming quarters to fall well short of expectations.

As for Nvidia, it’s the largest company on the planet, with ample catalysts in the new year. But until GPU sales fall off a cliff and buyers pass on Rubin, shares of Nvidia certainly do seem harder to short, at least in my opinion, especially when you consider that 24.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is nothing close to resembling a bubble. Though if the year ahead’s earnings fall well short of expectations, perhaps the seemingly cheap valuation metrics are more of a mirage than an indicator of real value.

For now, Rubin is projected to be a hit and a major catalyst that could help Nvidia stock continue defying the odds. The hyperscalers are ready to spend, and there’s probably going to be an arms race for the latest and greatest GPUs, especially when you consider the memory shortage and how it could incentivize backing up the truck whenever there’s stock, perhaps in a similar manner as the toilet paper boom during the early days of the COVID pandemic.

Billionaire Chris Rokos buys Nvidia, sells Palantir

Given Rubin Ultra, and Feynman after that, and how much is on the line to stay ahead in the AI race as Chinese rivals pick up the pace, perhaps dropping Palantir for Nvidia could be the smarter move. Undoubtedly, Michael Burry is far more bearish on one name than the other. And with famed billionaire investor Chris Rokos selling Palantir while buying into Nvidia, it seems like a smart move, not just based on relative valuation, but given the likelihood that AI demand will be in a spot to fuel a surge, the likes of which investors may not have seen since 2024.

So, should investors follow Roko’s lead by dumping Palantir for the likes of Nvidia? That’s the big question going into the new year. Personally, the valuation seems too hefty to warrant doubling down on Palantir after its latest slump, especially when you consider the magnitude of Michael Burry’s bearish bets.

Going into the new year, it feels like Burry is as confident as ever in his big bearish bets. He doesn’t think he’s too early, and he’s been keeping investors informed with his new Substack newsletter. Though I personally wouldn’t want to be a new buyer in Palantir or Nvidia, especially as the technical picture gets a bit scarier, I do think Palantir stock could stand to lose more ground if 2026 is a year when the AI bubble lets out a bit more of its air.

As for Palantir, it’s tough to tell how things will pan out as AI software companies look to get in on the action. Perhaps the ultimate pick and shovels play is still the way to go. Ultimately, I think Roko’s latest move has the potential to prove well-timed as both companies head into a new year with high expectations set ahead of them.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry1-pEE.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 11:59:42.314550

So when people worry about the market's high P/E ratio, remember that the number itself doesn't tell the whole story.","Editor's note: The market rocketed to one new high after another in 2025... And if you're like many folks, you might be starting to worry. But as Joe Austin from our corporate affiliate Chaikin Analytics explains, the measure of value most folks are looking at can be misleading.

In today's Weekend Edition, we're taking a break from our usual fare to share a recent piece from the free Chaikin PowerFeed e-letter. In it, Joe explains why this metric isn't enough on its own – and reveals a better way to think about the full picture in investing.

When the market is up, people start to worry about valuations...

And one of the most popular valuation metrics is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

The calculation is simple. Divide the price of a stock by its earnings per share.

Right now, the S&P 500 Index trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of more than 30 times. Historically, that's high. But as we'll explain, this one metric doesn't tell the full story...

Here's what the P/E ratio for U.S. stocks looks like on a longer-term basis...

""Bears"" often cite high P/E ratios as a reason for caution...

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently got on this bandwagon. Back in September, he sent the market tumbling by noting in a speech that ""equity prices are fairly highly valued.""

But it's not so cut-and-dried on how important the P/E ratio is...

I talked with my colleague and Chaikin Analytics founder Marc Chaikin for his take on the importance of the P/E ratio – particularly its role in determining Power Gauge ratings.

At Chaikin Analytics, we use the Power Gauge to analyze the markets. This key tool gathers investment fundamentals and technicals into a simple rating of ""bullish,"" ""neutral,"" or ""bearish.""

Marc said that in the 1980s and 1990s, P/E ratios were highly relevant in identifying attractive stocks. Price-to-sales (P/S) ratios later took priority... then yielded to earnings growth and momentum.

Today, the Power Gauge uses the projected P/E ratio within the Earnings category, which is just one of the categories it looks at to determine a stock's rating. And it ranks that ratio on a relative basis versus other stocks.

If the projected P/E ratio drifts upward, that isn't automatically a bad sign. What matters is how the ratio ranks versus other stocks – not the absolute number.

Of course, people love to talk about P/E ratios. And they usually infer that a high P/E ratio is bad... and that a low P/E ratio is good.

But that doesn't always hold true in practice. Let's look at a couple of examples...

Two Vastly Different Moves Following 'Low' and 'High' P/E Ratios

First is athletic apparel company Lululemon Athletica (LULU)...

As a brand, Lululemon is a massive success.

The company's clothes are everywhere. And folks love them...

When asked whether they considered themselves loyal customers, 83% of Lululemon's customers said ""yes.""

And 8 out of every 10 Lululemon customers join the company's membership program. As of 2024, that program had 22 million members.

To an investor, that looks like a formidable competitive moat.

And going into 2024, Lululemon's stock looked attractive based on its historical P/E range...

As you can see, its P/E ratio had dropped from almost 90 times to around 64 times. Investors might have thought they were getting a bargain.

But consider how Lululemon's stock ended up performing...

It fell by about 25% in 2024. And it ended 2025 down roughly 46%.

As it turns out, Lululemon's products had become stale and predictable – particularly in its core U.S. market, where sales were declining.

And buying the stock just because its P/E ratio looked cheap would've lost you a lot of money.

A different example is Big Pharma firm Eli Lilly (LLY)...

Lilly's drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro generated $10.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. This made tirzepatide – which is behind both Zepbound and Mounjaro – the world's bestselling drug. Lilly now controls about 58% of the obesity drug market.

But Lilly looked expensive in January 2024. Its P/E ratio had more than tripled – from less than 30 times to more than 100 times. A skeptic would've said you were paying way too much for the stock.

Take a look at this chart...

Since then, Lilly has soared. The stock jumped by about 32% in 2024. And it closed out 2025 up roughly 40%.

These examples reveal something important...

There's More to a Good Investment Than the P/E Ratio

A low P/E ratio doesn't guarantee a good investment. And a high P/E ratio doesn't mean you should automatically avoid a stock.

Business quality and growth potential matter more than one simple valuation metric.

Plus, some stocks are cyclical – think automakers, homebuilders, and industrial companies.

Cyclical stocks flip that ""low P/E ratio"" versus ""high P/E ratio"" logic on its head...

They'll often look cheapest (with a low P/E ratio) at the worst possible time to buy. That's usually right before earnings collapse.

And the opposite is also true...

Cyclical stocks often look most expensive (with a high P/E ratio) at the best time to buy. That's when earnings have hit bottom and are about to rebound.

True, the S&P 500's valuation of more than 30 times trailing 12-month earnings is high. But again, P/E ratios alone don't determine investment success.

A stock with a low P/E ratio can still be a terrible investment if the business is deteriorating. Meanwhile, a high P/E ratio can be a powerful signal of a company's growth prospects.

So when people worry about the market's high P/E ratio, remember that the number itself doesn't tell the whole story.

In investing, what really matters is finding quality businesses with strong fundamentals and growth potential.

Good investing,

ChatGPT is morphing into an operating system, and OpenAI is designing devices with Jony Ive to replace the iPhone. The vision: users complete tasks through chatbots instead of smartphone apps, threatening Apple’s walled garden.

The reality: Journal tests show occasional wow moments surrounded by dysfunction. Traditional apps remain too capable to replace quickly.

Instacart Works Seamlessly—By Exception

ChatGPT created a vegetarian weekly menu and filled a Costco cart with ingredients, linking directly to checkout. The success required three months of joint development, shared offices, and a former Instacart CEO (now OpenAI executive) breaking a development logjam.

This level of integration isn’t scalable across the app ecosystem.

Most Apps Add Friction Rather Than Remove It

Uber inside ChatGPT estimates costs but cannot book rides—users must retype addresses on a separate webpage. OpenTable gave error messages on reservation requests. Tripadvisor showed maps for 30 seconds before failing. “Tripadvisor is being a little useless,” ChatGPT admitted.

Users Must Know Magic Incantations

Connecting to apps requires “@uber” syntax and precise phrasing. “How do I get an Uber?” fails; users must know the exact commands. This defeats the purpose of natural language interfaces.

Developers Are There for the Audience

All 12 developers interviewed said they built ChatGPT apps because their users are there—800 million of them. But apps are designed to steer users back to more capable smartphone apps or websites.

The Tollbooth Economics Are Real

Instacart pays OpenAI a transaction fee based on basket value at checkout. Whoever provides the gateway to online services owns valuable real estate—today that is Apple with its App Store fees at 30% versus OpenAI’s emerging 10-15%.

ChatGPT’s app ecosystem resembles the early App Store: primitive, inconsistent, occasionally magical. Apple’s iPhone apps took years to mature into indispensable tools.

British giant WPP saw its shares plummet around 60% over the year, driven by client losses, multiple profit warnings, and fears of AI disruption eroding margins. Rivals like Omnicom, Publicis Groupe, and Interpublic Group (IPG) also faced pressure, though less severe, amid a broader narrative of agencies losing ground to automated solutions from Big Tech.

Yet, this downturn may prove temporary. Analysts argue that AI's efficiencies could spark an ""arms race"" in creative spending, while agencies' expertise in complex strategy and budget allocation remains irreplaceable. As the initial hype fades, human insight - paired with AI tools - could drive a recovery.

The AI-Driven Sell-Off: Facts from 2025

WPP's struggles epitomize the sector's pain. The company issued profit warnings in July and October, forecasting revenue declines of 3-6% and citing client caution, economic uncertainty, and a sharp drop in new business pitches (down to one-third of prior levels). Shares hit multi-decade lows, with the stock relegated from the FTSE 100 in December after a 62% yearly drop. CEO transitions and restructuring followed, including heavy AI investments to counter the threat.

Peers weren't immune: Omnicom and IPG stocks dipped amid similar concerns, though Omnicom's $13 billion acquisition of IPG (closed November 2025) created the world's largest agency group, aiming for $750 million in synergies. Publicis fared better, leveraging its CoreAI platform for growth. Overall, agency valuations hit lows not seen since 2020, with Barclays downgrading several in mid-2025 over immediate AI risks.

Client behavior fueled the fire. Brands increasingly build internal AI teams, bypassing agencies for routine tasks. Coca-Cola's 2025 holiday campaign - fully AI-generated for the second year - exemplified this: Produced with far fewer staff (20 vs. 50 traditionally), it prioritized cost savings despite backlash over ""uncanny"" visuals and perceived lack of soul. Executives defended it as forward-thinking, but consumers criticized the ""slop,"" highlighting tensions in AI adoption.

Google's Tools: Automation Without Full Replacement

Google amplified the disruption with updates to Performance Max and the new AI Max for Search suite (launched May 2025). These AI-powered features automate bidding, creatives, targeting, and even ad copy, promising 14-27% more conversions. While empowering in-house teams, they haven't solved core challenges like optimal budget allocation across fragmented channels—a human forte rooted in experience and intuition.

As one report noted, AI excels at execution but struggles with strategic nuance in a multi-platform world. Agencies like WPP are responding by developing proprietary AI (e.g., WPP Open), positioning themselves as integrators rather than casualties.

Why the Pain May Be Short-Lived

Lower AI production costs could boost overall ad spend, per JPMorgan analysts, igniting competition for standout campaigns. Agencies' vast data troves and cross-channel expertise remain hard to replicate. Morningstar's Mark Giarelli emphasized: ""The industry is being disrupted, but it’s not being disintermediated.""

Consumer shifts add complexity: Younger audiences favor ""quiet luxury,"" minimalism, influencer collabs, and resale over logo-heavy ads. Navigating this - plus ethical AI use and regulatory hurdles - demands professional guidance. As neuro-hype cools, agencies blending human creativity with AI could thrive.

In 2025, AI dented agency stocks profoundly, but the sector's resilience suggests a pivot ahead. For marketers, the future isn't obsolescence - it's evolution. Hold tight; the rebound might just be loading.

Leading wire-to-wire, the Wolverines (13-0, 3-0) faced little consternation after an initial flurry, the only exception being when standout forward Yaxel Lendeborg left for the locker room late in the first half.

Any concerns of serious injury were quickly assuaged, however, when Lendeborg rejoined the lineup to start the second half. He finished with a muted offensive stat line, scoring all eight of his points early and shooting just 3 of 10 from the floor, but it did little to hinder Michigan.

USC (12-2, 1-2) went scoreless for the game’s first 6:41, digging itself an 11-0 hole before Ezra Ausar finally got the Trojans on the board converting a successful and-one.

USC recovered briefly to cut the deficit to five points with 12 minutes left in the half but that was as close as the Trojans came. Their first-half struggles compounded seconds before intermission when, after he committed a turnover on the offensive end, Chad Baker-Mazara fouled Nimari Burnett on the ensuing Michigan fast break to garner his fourth personal.

The sequence sent Michigan into halftime ahead by 18 points and contributed to Baker-Mazara scoring just 12 points, almost 10 fewer than his season average coming into Friday’s contest.

Michigan shot just 6 of 30 from 3-point range on the night, but USC was unable to capitalize against a stingy Michigan defense. The Wolverines held the Trojans to just 20 of 58 shooting from the floor while forcing USC into 21 turnovers.

Michigan’s defensive dominance included three blocked shots from Lendeborg, three steals from Aday Mara, and two steals each from Elliot Cadeau and Johnson.

Cadeau also helped fuel the balanced Wolverines offense that featured five players scoring in double figures, dishing a game-high seven assists and grabbing six rebounds to match Johnson and Mara for the team lead.

It is the third banking hub to open in the county, with similar services already in Calne and Royal Wootton Bassett.
""But the irony is not lost on the whole of Westbury that the banking hub is going into a building which was a bank.
The [return of a] banking hub and a post office are two things we've worked doggedly on.""
The official opening of the banking hub will take place on 9 January at 11:00 GMT, with campaigner Val Jarvis - who launched a petition to reinstate banking services to Westbury - set to cut the ribbon.","A permanent banking hub has opened in a town after years of campaign work.

The facility on the High Street in Westbury, Wiltshire, is operating in a former Barclays bank building which shut in 2019.

It is the third banking hub to open in the county, with similar services already in Calne and Royal Wootton Bassett.

""It's brilliant news,"" said Westbury's mayor, Jane Russ. ""But the irony is not lost on the whole of Westbury that the banking hub is going into a building which was a bank. The [return of a] banking hub and a post office are two things we've worked doggedly on.""

Banking hubs offer a counter service operated by the Post Office, where customers can carry out cash transactions, ask questions and receive advice.

Westbury's new banking hub was recommended by LINK, the UK's ATM network, after a community request and campaign work by residents, Westbury Town Council and former mayor Sheila Kimmins.

Gareth Oakley, CEO at Cash Access UK, which runs the facility, said it would ensure ""crucial access to cash and face-to-face banking services for residents and businesses across the community"".

While the new hub was being refurbished, a temporary one was set up at the Laverton building in Westbury.

It is hoped the permanent location will complement Westbury's rotunda project, which will see a space near the town's library used to host more events.

Ms Russ said: ""The temporary banking hub was a little out of town and up a hill which meant it wasn't useful for everyone. I'm delighted this new permanent hub has been sorted out.

""By the time we've got the rotunda sorted, this will all suddenly alter the whole feel of the high street in Westbury. If a town looks loved, it will be.""

The official opening of the banking hub will take place on 9 January at 11:00 GMT, with campaigner Val Jarvis - who launched a petition to reinstate banking services to Westbury - set to cut the ribbon.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/360e/live/9db3b300-e7b2-11f0-a5c4-2f5ecdd63f6f.png,N,,2026-01-03 02:58:47.652389

Processing Content

""We expect strong borrower credit profiles, relatively stable employment levels, and persistent home price appreciation to help mitigate pressures from ongoing housing-affordability challenges,"" Fitch analysts Christopher Grimes, Tana Marcom and Laura Kaster wrote.

Fitch's outlook incorporates the impact of the potential stress of a slowing U.S. economy in 2026 on mortgage insurers, the report issued on Dec. 30 said.

""New business pricing has been stable, with conservative underwriting across the industry amid economic uncertainty,"" Fitch said.

All of the active firms are adopting black-box pricing, which has also led to market share shifts.

Meanwhile, Fitch expressed a small level of concern regarding default activity in 2026; mortgage insurers only pay out claims after the loan goes into foreclosure.

""Headline unemployment figures have not meaningfully risen, but the pace of recent hiring activity has been slowing, which could pressure some borrowers if hiring slows further in 2026,"" the report said. ""However, strong borrower credit characteristics and favorable home equity appreciation for most homeowners should moderate the frequency and severity of ultimate MI claims.""

Rising originations effect on MI

Mortgage originations are expected to increase this year, and this will benefit the mortgage insurers' new insurance written volume, Fitch said. Fannie Mae projects $2.37 trillion for 2026, up from $1.92 trillion; the Mortgage Bankers Association's forecast is for $2.2 trillion, compared with $2.05 trillion during 2025.

But unlike title insurance, MI production is not correlated with total loan volume. Private MI is used in the conforming market only for originations with loan-to-value ratio over 80%. It is not needed for many non-qualified mortgages. Government-guarantee programs cover other loans.

""NIW credit quality has not deteriorated despite home-affordability challenges,"" the Fitch report added. ""MI competitors in aggregate reported relatively stable delinquency levels in the third quarter, with the overall industry delinquency rate increasing to 2.15% from 1.98% year-over-year.""

The increase is likely a result of normal portfolio seasoning and typical calendar-based seasonal loss activity, the analysts continued.

Just under half of the current insurance-in-force as of the end of the third quarter was produced between 2020 and 2022.

Persistency, a measure of how much business remains on the books from 12 months' prior, is likely to come under pressure if rates decline further, resulting in higher portfolio turnover. Through Sept. 30, 2025, persistency averaged 84% over the prior 12 months.

""Fitch believes a disciplined approach to capital management, characterized by strong private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (PMIERS) ratios, strategic capital allocation, and a focus on liquidity will continue to bolster ratings in the MI sector in 2026,"" the report noted.

The rating agency will continue to monitor merger and acquisition trends to expand beyond the core business, such as Radian's decision to buy a specialty insurer while selling its title, conduit and real estate services businesses.

""Additionally, the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could mean greater opportunities for private MIs, but also invite more regulatory and market uncertainty, requiring careful capital and risk management,"" Grimes, Marcom and Kaster wrote.

How the large title insurers will do in 2026

Earlier in December, Fitch also put out a title insurance outlook, which also is neutral, ""reflecting expectations for stable profitability and ratings.

""Strong capital positions, modestly higher origination volumes, and continued expense management will support the sector's margins and ratings in the coming year,"" Fitch said.

Title loss ratios should remain at favorable levels, as the underwriters benefit from premium growth and a continued focus on expense management.

""Risks to sector performance include a substantial increase in mortgage rates, tighter credit conditions or economic deterioration, which could pressure volumes and margins,"" a press release said. ""However, Fitch's baseline scenario anticipates manageable headwinds and continued stability in ratings for the sector in 2026.""

The Federal Housing Finance Agency's Title Acceptance Pilot — introduced by the Biden Administration and expanded by current director Bill Pulte — will not affect the sector's ratings because of its limited scope.

On Dec. 3, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods held its annual title day, with the four major underwriters.

The tone regarding the industry's regulation from the four companies — Fidelity National Financial, First American, Stewart and Old Republic — was ""fairly positive,"" KBW said, with no incremental updates from the FHFA and Bill Pulte, its director. The title pilot ends in May.

One regulatory cloud on the title business is a 6.2% reduction in rates in Texas, which state regulators will put into effect on March 1 (the rollback was finalized on Dec. 12, 2025).

Regulators have previously pushed for a 10% reduction, which was put on hold by a court injunction.

""FNF had disclosed earlier that the impact of even a 10% premium reduction in Texas would be negligible,"" the KBW report said.

How commercial real estate sales affect title companies in 2026

Expectations that commercial real estate transaction volume will grow this year are another positive for the title business in the Fitch report. Rated national title underwriters' ability to maintain favorable margins because of their higher premiums versus residential transactions is contingent on this trend.

In the first nine months of last year, the commercial business was a significant 20% share of premiums.

KBW takes a similar position on the impact of commercial real estate transactions for title insurers this year.

""While the timing of any recovery in the residential purchase market remains uncertain, the title insurance sector should continue to benefit from the strong level of activity in the commercial real estate market, which is expected to continue into 2026 and should provide a bridge to an eventual recovery in the purchase market,"" the report on the event from Bose George and Frankie Labetti said.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89992d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1020x536+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F22%2F6b6236db493d8417508e1c0c9e65%2Fnmn010226-fitch-16x9.png,N,,2026-01-03 10:59:54.158515

Light strips and other lights with a gradient function now offer another mode in addition to Linear, Mirrored, and Diffuse. In this blog post, you’ll learn what “Segmented” is all about.

Where exactly can you find the new mode and the different styles? It’s very simple: First, select the desired gradient light in the Hue app and then activate a color in the colorful color wheel. A small button will appear at the bottom right of the brightness control. Tap on it to open a menu showing the available modes.

Linear: Creates a linear color gradient where you can freely set three light points. The colors in between are generated automatically.

Mirrored: A linear color gradient in which the effect is mirrored in the middle of the light strip.

Scattered: Up to five colors of your choice are mixed and distributed across the various lights (such as the Hue Festavia string of lights) or the zones of the light strip.

Segmented: You can select up to five different colors. Unlike in linear mode, no color gradients are generated between the colors.

If the new mode is not yet visible to you, a software update may be necessary. It is best to activate the automatic update and leave the light strip or light connected to the power supply.

This is what the new Hue effect looks like

I have already tried out the new segmented mode with a Philips Hue Flux light strip, which I installed behind a Kallax shelf.

Frontier Airlines sends threatening note to flight attendants In the run-up to New Year’s Eve 2025, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received the following email addressing a spike in sickness amongst crew members: ""Let me make it clear: this trend is unacceptable and unsustainable.
The vast majority of our flight attendants consistently uphold their responsibilities with professionalism and dependability, and this policy reinforces that standard.""

Not least, in customer-facing jobs where employees are surrounded by sick and infectious people.

But just before the New Year, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received an unusually blunt email from the Denver-based budget carrier. The tone was painfully clear: the airline believes that crew members are abusing their sick leave, and Frontier was going to take action to stamp it out.

Frontier Airlines sends threatening note to flight attendants

In the run-up to New Year’s Eve 2025, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received the following email addressing a spike in sickness amongst crew members:

""Let me make it clear: this trend is unacceptable and unsustainable. While illness and legitimate emergencies do happen, the frequency and timing of sick calls have reached a point where we can confidently say this protection is no longer being used as intended and where drastic action is now necessary.

Reliability is a fundamental expectation of this role that each of us committed to when choosing this career. When absenteeism increases, aircraft don't takeoff, schedules collapse, and trust, both internally and externally is eroded.""

So, how does Frontier plan to slash sickness rates? Since December 30, 2025, flight attendants are expected to provide a doctor’s note for any sickness.

Frontier says the policy is being enforced “without exception” and that failure to provide an official sick note will go down as an unexcused absence, which could then lead to disciplinary proceedings.

The email from Frontier added:

""This action is necessary to safeguard operational integrity and ensure fairness to those who act responsibly every day. The vast majority of our flight attendants consistently uphold their responsibilities with professionalism and dependability, and this policy reinforces that standard.""

Union says airline is within its rights

When you’re stuck in a metal tube for up to 12 hours or longer a day, surrounded by members of the public, battling tiredness from early starts and late finishes, and staying in different hotels every night, it’s probably no surprise that sickness rates amongst flight attendants are higher than the average office worker.

It appears, however, that Frontier doesn’t believe the spike in sick calls is completely down to legitimate sickness. But while the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), which represents crew members at Frontier, says it doesn’t agree with the policy or the tone or the email from the airline, it says Frontier is well within its rights.

Under the current flight attendant contract, Frontier is allowed to impose periods where all flight attendants must present a doctor’s note for sickness, so long as prior warning is given.

As Frontier provided prior warning, it can legitimately ask all flight attendants to provide a doctor’s note for sick calls. And while the contract provides examples like the Christmas Holidays or Super Bowl weekend when fake sick calls might spike, it appears as if Frontier is allowed to designate periods whenever it thinks it is required.

In a memo to its members, however, the AFA urged flight attendants to prioritize their health. “While attendance expectations exist, no one should feel pressured to fly while sick,” the memo read. “Taking care of yourself protects you, your crew, and your passengers.”

CDC estimates 7.5 million flu cases so far this season

After a particularly rough flu season during flu season in Australia and New Zealand, health experts have been anticipating a similar trend in Europe and North America. Unfortunately, those predictions are proving to be correct.

As of December 20, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 7.5 million flu illnesses so far this season, resulting in 81,000 hospitalizations, and 3,100 deaths.

In its weekly influenza report, the CDC warned that flu activity is “elevated and continues to increase across the country.”

United Airlines won a legal battle to demand a doctor’s note

In July 2024, United Airlines also introduced a mandatory doctor’s note policy for all sick calls from flight attendants after witnessing a spike in callouts from crew members that allegedly coincided with weekends.

Giving flight attendants just 24 hours’ notice of the policy, United said it would require an absence certificate obtained at the crew members’ expense if they reported sick for any trip that departed on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

The United branch of AFA-CWA called the policy ‘reprehensible’ and launched a legal challenge, arguing that their contract prohibited United from demanding absence certificates with the exception of the Fourth of July and Christmas holiday period.

Nearly a year later, an independent arbitrator said the flight attendant contract did, in fact, give United the unilateral power to demand an absence certificate when there was evidence of “abuse or misuse of sick leave.”

United had provided evidence to the arbitrator that showed a “dramatic and sustained surge in weekend sick calls,” with sickness rates at the weekend surging to 22% in the months before the policy was implemented.

Ultimately, United suspended the weekend sickness policy just weeks after it was implemented, claiming that it had achieved the desired effect of reducing sick calls back to acceptable levels.",https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1445228615-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 06:57:53.949237

Für Anleger stellt sich die Frage, welche konkreten Vorteile diese Kooperation für UPM-Kymmene bringen könnte. Die Genehmigungsphase ist abgeschlossen, doch die eigentliche Bewährungsprobe steht noch bevor.

Partnerschaft im Holzsektor nimmt Gestalt an

Die strategische Allianz zwischen UPM-Kymmene und Versowood zielt darauf ab, die Position beider Unternehmen im Bereich der Holzverarbeitung zu stärken. Während UPM-Kymmene als diversifizierter Forstkonzern mit Aktivitäten von Papier bis Bioenergie bekannt ist, bringt Versowood spezialisierte Kompetenzen in der Holzindustrie ein.

Der Zeitpunkt der Genehmigung zum Jahresende lässt vermuten, dass beide Partner zügig mit der operativen Umsetzung beginnen wollen. Dennoch bleibt abzuwarten, wie schnell sich mögliche Synergieeffekte tatsächlich realisieren lassen. Regulatorische Hürden sind überwunden, doch die Integration zweier Unternehmenskulturen erfordert Zeit und sorgfältige Planung.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Upm-Kymmene?

Shortly after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States, he signed an executive order creating the MAHA Commission.
“The American food system is safe but could be healthier,” the commission said.
“We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply,” Kennedy Jr. said.
During the Institute of Food Technologists’ IFT FIRST conference in July, Martin Hahn, partner at Hogan Lovells US, recommended manufacturers adopt a short-term strategy of aligning product development with the goals of MAHA.","KANSAS CITY — Make America healthy again (MAHA) has transitioned from political slogan to a federal initiative spearheaded by the US Department of Health and Human Services and intended to drive change throughout the food and beverage supply chain. As a result, manufacturers of products perceived as ultra processed or containing shunned ingredients like additives, artificial colors or synthetic colors are under pressure to reformulate. The challenge facing companies is many MAHA initiatives are founded in perception and not supported by science.

Shortly after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States, he signed an executive order creating the MAHA Commission. In May, the commission published a report it said was intended to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases in children by reducing their exposure to ultra-processed foods (UPFs), chemicals like pesticides and ensuring they are not over medicated.

“The American food system is safe but could be healthier,” the commission said. “Most children’s diets are dominated by ultra-processed foods high in sugars, chemical additives and saturated fats while lacking sufficient intakes of fruits and vegetables.”

The commission noted that nearly 70% of an American child’s calories today come from UPFs. The report provided a broad definition of UPFs as “packaged or ready-consume products that are formulated for shelf life and/or palatability but are typically high in added sugars, refined grains, unhealthy fats, sodium and low in fiber and essential nutrients.”

Statistically, the report claimed roughly 70% of the over 300,000 branded food products available in grocery stores today are ultra processed.

Three problematic ingredients identified in the report were ultra-processed grains, sugars and fats.

“These engineered components, virtually nonexistent a century ago, now account for over two-thirds of all calories consumed by American children,” the report said.

Other ingredients identified as contributing to the poor health of American children included emulsifiers, binders, sweeteners, colorings and preservatives, specifically, titanium dioxide, propylparaben, butylated hydroxytoluene and artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose and saccharin.

“Additives in processed foods are consumed in complex combinations, where cumulative and synergistic effects may amplify harm beyond individual components,” according to the report. “Yet, testing often ignores these interactions, particularly in children. With dozens of additives consumed daily, these overlooked risks could be significantly impacting children’s health.”

The report drew swift responses from industry groups, with the main critiques being a lack of inclusiveness in its development and the evidence used to support its recommendations.

In a letter to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the HHS, more than 250 food and agriculture groups requested an opportunity to participate in future decisions by the committee.

“As organizations representing millions of farmers, ranchers, food producers and ingredient manufacturers, we write to urge you to ensure food and agriculture have a seat at the table during the development of policy recommendations related to the recent Make America Healthy Again Commission report, as well as any future commission activities,” the letter said. “The process by which the commission’s most recent report was created lacked transparency and any opportunity for public engagement. As a result, the report contained numerous errors and distortions that have created unfounded fears about the safety of our food supply.”

Additionally, the letter included references to an article published by the news service Notus that said while the MAHA Commission report cited over 500 studies, the citations contained errors ranging from broken website links to misstated conclusions. Seven of the cited sources did not appear to exist at all, according to the Notus article.

The industry response may have resonated, because when a second MAHA Commission report was published in September, its recommendations focused on removing foods perceived as unhealthy from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and revising the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Going forward, the second report recommended research be conducted on the health effects of products such as UPFs.

“NIH (the National Institutes of Health) will partner with FDA (the Food and Drug Administration), USDA, and the administration for a Healthy America to conduct high quality nutrition research and ingredient assessments,” the second report said. “As part of this effort, NIH will expand research on dietary patterns that support metabolic health. NIH and HHS will take steps to fully utilize the newly created FDA and NIH Joint Nutrition Regulatory Science Program. USDA will prioritize precision nutrition research.”

The FDA also has begun the process of defining UPFs, seeking information from interested parties about what constitutes such products.

“We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply,” Kennedy Jr. said. “Defining ultra-processed foods with a clear, uniform standard will empower us even more to make America healthy again.”

While MAHA’s primary focus has been on UPFs, its most significant impact has been on the use of synthetic colors in formulations. In April, the FDA said it intended to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes.

While the FDA’s current initiatives are voluntary, many food and beverage companies have said they plan to stop using the ingredients.The main reason is states like California, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia have passed laws banning the ingredients, and, even though federal law is supposed to supersede state law, the FDA has shown no intention of asserting its authority to regulate food ingredients.

That has left food manufacturers with few options other than to begin phasing out synthetic dyes.

During the Institute of Food Technologists’ IFT FIRST conference in July, Martin Hahn, partner at Hogan Lovells US, recommended manufacturers adopt a short-term strategy of aligning product development with the goals of MAHA.

“MAHA has been very effective at getting states to pass ingredient bans, so when you are formulating products today, you need to be aware of those states that have banned ingredients, such as certified colors being banned in West Virginia,” he said. “We need to be formulating products today that will be compliant with future regulations.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2025/05/27/MAHA-lead----WINDCOLORS.jpg?height=635&t=1748354435&width=1200,N,,2026-01-03 07:57:52.587700

Entertainment plays a central role in the campaign, with a programme that includes robot dance performances and sci-fi-themed shows, underscoring HTDF’s focus on immersive retail. A partnership with the Honor of Kings Challenger Cup esports tournament introduces gaming culture into the duty-free environment, with cosplayers, limited-edition merchandise and gift redemptions aimed at attracting younger consumers.

Further amplifying footfall, visitors attending a 9 January concert by pop star Angela Zhang are eligible for exclusive shopping benefits, while a 3.5-metre figurine inspired by the singer has become a high-profile photo point at the mall entrance.

The anniversary also serves as a platform for brand expansion and portfolio enhancement. Recent openings include SUQQU’s first-ever duty-free boutique globally, alongside new fashion and lifestyle brands such as Hechter and Under Armour Outdoor.

The change is aimed at addressing long-standing consumer complaints about partial reimbursements and limited customer service options.
Delivery platforms will now be required to provide customers with an itemized breakdown of each transaction and offer access to a human customer service representative.
The measure builds on California’s Fair Food Delivery Act of 2020, which imposed a series of restrictions on third-party delivery platforms following allegations of unfair business practices.
That earlier law capped delivery fees and required greater transparency between restaurants, delivery companies and customers.","Food delivery apps will soon have to change how they handle refunds in California.

Starting Thursday, Jan. 1, a new state law will require platforms like DoorDash, Uber Eats and others to issue full cash refunds rather than in-app credits when customers experience missing or incorrect orders. The change is aimed at addressing long-standing consumer complaints about partial reimbursements and limited customer service options.

Under Assembly Bill 578, authored by Democratic Assemblywoman Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who has said her own experience with food delivery problems helped inspire the legislation, food delivery companies must refund the full amount of an order, including taxes and tips, to the customer’s original payment method when a delivery is not completed as promised. In cases where only part of an order is missing or incorrect, companies are still permitted to issue partial refunds.

The law also introduces new transparency and customer service requirements. Delivery platforms will now be required to provide customers with an itemized breakdown of each transaction and offer access to a human customer service representative. Human contact is mandatory when a customer’s issue cannot be resolved through automated systems, according to the filing.

In addition, AB 578 includes safeguards designed to address potential fraud, allowing companies to investigate suspicious refund requests while still complying with the law’s consumer protection standards.

The measure builds on California’s Fair Food Delivery Act of 2020, which imposed a series of restrictions on third-party delivery platforms following allegations of unfair business practices. That earlier law capped delivery fees and required greater transparency between restaurants, delivery companies and customers.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 578 into law in October. The California governor framed the bill as part of a broader push to strengthen consumer protections in the state.

“California is hard at work to help make your life more affordable,” Newsom said in a statement at the time. “These new laws reflect who we are: a state that protects workers, respects students, puts people before politics, and isn't afraid to hold powerful interests accountable.”

Consumer advocates have long criticized food delivery platforms for relying on app credits instead of cash refunds, arguing that credits can expire, limit customer choice and pressure users to continue using the same service after a negative experience. Supporters of AB 578 say the new requirements ensure customers are properly compensated when a delivery fails, without strings attached.",https://people.com/thmb/9OsgjM3336fkIyZQHBkhctR_908=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(639x0:641x2)/food-delivery-app-wars-grubhub-vs-uber-eats-5080528-1-22f63d30687d4b8bbb113b9e9e9c6915.png,N,,2026-01-02 23:58:24.930723

Close to half of respondents predicted a rise in output in the new year, the company said in a release on Friday.

In December, confidence strengthened for the third month running and was the highest since March 2024.

The S&P Global Vietnam Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index ended the year at 53.0, down slightly from 53.8 in November but still comfortably above the 50.0 no change mark and signalling a solid monthly improvement in the overall health of the sector, the company stated.

Andrew Harker, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in the release: ""The Vietnamese manufacturing sector ended a turbulent year on a positive note, with output and new orders rising solidly again and business confidence hitting a 21-month high.""

""Overall, the sector goes into 2026 in a positive position, with manufacturers optimistic of securing new business and being able to expand their production capacity. S &P Global Market Intelligence forecasts industrial production growth of 6.7% in 2026,"" he added.

The final month of 2025 saw the Vietnamese manufacturing sector remain ""firmly inside growth territory"".

Firms expanded output solidly again amid rising new orders, with better weather conditions helping to boost capacity. Employment increased, aiding efforts to reduce backlogs of work.

Vietnamese manufacturers again registered growth of production in December, extending the current sequence of expansion to eight months.

Although weather conditions were more stable in December, the severe typhoons and flooding seen in previous months continued to impact the manufacturing sector at the end of the year, principally due to the effect of damage to raw materials on their delivery and supplier delays caused by flooding.

Suppliers' delivery times lengthened markedly again, within stances of delays only slightly less pronounced than the three-and-a-half year record posted in November.

Meanwhile, input costs increased at the fastest pace since June 2022 amid material scarcity and unfavourable exchange rate movements. In turn, output prices increased solidly, with the pace of inflation little-changed from November. The latest rise was much faster than the average for 2025 as a whole.

Although input costs increased rapidly, manufacturers still raised their purchasing activity sharply amid higher new orders and greater output requirements. Moreover, the pace of growth quickened to a 16-month high. Stocks of inputs also rose, the third month running in which this has been the case.

Stocks of finished goods, on the other hand, fell solidly as completed items were dispatched promptly to customers.

The National Assembly, Vietnam's legislature, on November 12 approved a resolution setting an economic expansion target of at least 10% for 2026, per capita GDP at $5,400-5,500, and inflation controlled at around 4.5%.

The government aimed to enlarge the national economy by 8.3-8.5% for 2025. GDP grew 7.85% in the first nine months. The figure was the second-highest levels in 11 years, except for 2023 which saw a strong surge post the pandemic.

Vietnam's economic outcomes in 2025 are yet to be released by the General Statistics Office.

Standard Chartered in late October raised its Vietnam GDP growth forecast to 7.5% for 2025 from the previous 6.1%, and to 7.2% for 2026 from 6.2%, following HSBC's revising up its prediction to 7.9% (from 6.6%) and 6.7% (from 5.8%), respectively.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/news/2026/01/03/screenshot-2026-01-03-102557-105820.png,N,,2026-01-03 11:14:19.472129

“It’s been throughout the games, and obviously me playing him more minutes and making sure that he can continue to play.","The Nets trailed for the final 28 minutes of Thursday night’s loss to the Rockets.

But that doesn’t mean those minutes were meaningless.

Coach Jordi Fernández gave rookie Nolan Traore some tough love coming off the court after some ill-advised 3-point heaves made that clear.

The French teen is a good penetrator and downhill player but had just two assists to two turnovers, and shot just 1-for-8 overall, 1-for-5 from deep on shots he was mostly lured into.

“I need him to use his superpowers and touch the paint. And it felt like he got caught shooting the unders. And a lot of times it didn’t go … because that’s what they want you to do,” Fernández said. “And if you keep shooting and missing, then sometimes, if you keep doing the same thing and seeing the same results, that’s the definition of insanity. And I know how good he is.

“He can play pick-and-roll; he can touch the paint; he can reject pick-and-rolls; he can play with a pass. Two assists and two turnovers is just not good enough. That’s why I needed him to understand: that I need more. I’m OK with a pull-up 3; I don’t love it because he hasn’t shown that he can make it consistently. He can shoot as many catch-and-shoot 3s as he wants, but I didn’t think he played the game the way I wanted to play the game. If he gets 1 percent better [Friday] that’s what I want to see.”

The Nets were missing three-fifths of their starting lineup.

Michael Porter Jr. was out with an illness, Terance Mann was out with a right hip contusion, and lottery pick Egor Dëmin had lower back soreness.

“It’s been throughout the games, and obviously me playing him more minutes and making sure that he can continue to play. So, that’s something that popped up, but we believe he’ll be fine soon,” Fernández said. “He’ll be supporting his teammates and ready for the next one.”

Industry optimism and investment sentiment have strengthened, although cautiously, according to a new report by GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Biotech Index, reflected the renewed levels of optimism, showcasing its strongest performance since 2014.
Looking ahead at 2026, these sentiments are reiterated, according to GlobalData’s latest report, “The State of the Biopharmaceutical Industry 2026”.
As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the upcoming JP Morgan Healthcare conference will be a pivotal indicator on the direction for the biopharma sector for 2026.","Against the backdrop of a turbulent year marked by both breakthrough and setbacks, the biopharmaceutical industry is entering 2026 with renewed confidence. Industry optimism and investment sentiment have strengthened, although cautiously, according to a new report by GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.

In 2025, the biopharmaceutical industry began the year with strong scientific and commercial momentum with a high level of optimism with large deals seen around the JP Morgan Healthcare conference, including Johnson & Johnson’s $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies for its neuroscience portfolio, as well as GSK’s $1 billion deal with IDRx, and Eli Lilly acquiring an oncology drug candidate from Scorpion Therapeutics for $2.5 billion.

Hannah Hans, Head of Pharma Strategic Intelligence at GlobalData, comments: “However, industry sentiment quickly turned cautious. Q2 2025 saw the biopharma industry adopt a more guarded stance. Announcements of US drug pricing reforms under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) policy, tariffs, and trade uncertainties, combined with the looming patent cliffs, and rising costs collectively drove a more cautious outlook.”

Companies recalibrated in response to these pressures, and by Q3, they had adjusted cost structures and clarified development priorities. In addition, several large pharma companies engaged with the Trump administration to reach deals on drug pricing. The sector saw major deals with Pfizer outbidding Novo Nordisk to re-enter the obesity market with Metsera’s clinical-stage GLP-1 receptor agonist and amylin analogs, and Novartis acquiring Avidity to strengthen its neuromuscular disease portfolio. Out-licensing activity continued, highlighted by GSK’s $12.5 billion licensing deal with Jiangsu Hengrui reinforcing the growing strength and global relevance of innovation from China.

In November, the Jefferies Healthcare 2025 conference provided a valuable temperature check on the industry’s appetite for deals. Executives projected confidence about the opportunities and market outlook for 2026, while acknowledging the larger acquisitions Merck and Pfizer completed earlier in the year. They highlighted strong interest in breakthrough, innovative early science and the need for differentiating later-stage companies with promising results. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Biotech Index, reflected the renewed levels of optimism, showcasing its strongest performance since 2014.

Looking ahead at 2026, these sentiments are reiterated, according to GlobalData’s latest report, “The State of the Biopharmaceutical Industry 2026”. As per the report’s survey, 52% of pharmaceutical professionals felt optimistic or very optimistic about the industry’s growth in 2026, which is up by 10% compared to data gathered six months ago.

Additionally, 39% of the surveyed pharmaceutical industry professionals reported being optimistic or very optimistic on the recovery of biotech funding in the next 12 months, an increase by 15% from results seen in May 2025. This reflects a slightly more positive outlook compared to earlier in the year, which could be due to clarity on external factors such as MFN, tariffs, as well an increase in deal activity.

As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the upcoming JP Morgan Healthcare conference will be a pivotal indicator on the direction for the biopharma sector for 2026. The event will set the tone for dealmaking, capital flow and R&D priorities in the year ahead, as executives look to reaffirm investor confidence, aligning on the next wave of scientific and commercial breakthroughs to strengthen pipelines.

Hans concludes: “As we look to 2026, strong drug pipelines and breakthrough clinical catalysts will drive the sector, as pricing pressures are addressed, innovation and differentiation will take centre stage, and strategic deals accelerate growth and portfolio transformation.”

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

consent to u.k. bail-in power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement.

PS- 5

Selected Purchase Considerations

The Notes are not appropriate for all investors. The Notes may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

·You do not seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

·You understand and accept that you may not participate in the full appreciation of the Basket, which may be significant, and that your potential return on the Notes is limited to the Maximum Return.

·You can tolerate a loss of some or all of your principal amount, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Basket.

·You anticipate that the Final Basket Value will be greater than the Initial Basket Value.

·You understand and accept the risks that (a) the performance of lesser performing Basket Components will mitigate the performance of better performing Basket Components and (b) you may lose a significant portion of your investment even if one or more Basket Components performs positively.

·You understand and accept the risk that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value.

·You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Basket Components.

·You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of the Basket Components, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to the Basket Components.

·You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Basket.

·You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity.

·You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

·You seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

·You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of the Basket rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Maximum Return.

·You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of your Notes in the event that the Final Basket Value falls below the Initial Basket Value.

·You do not anticipate that the Final Basket Value will be greater than the Initial Basket Value.

·You are unwilling or unable to accept the risks that the performance of lesser performing Basket Components will mitigate the performance of better performing Basket Components and that you may lose a significant portion of your investment even if one or more Basket Components performs positively.

·You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Basket Components, and/or that is based on a weighted allocation of the Basket Components as set forth herein.

·You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to, the Basket Components.

·You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Basket.

·You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity.

·You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings.

·You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement, the prospectus and the prospectus supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the Notes for investment.

Hypothetical EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE at Maturity

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption:

§Hypothetical Initial Component Value of each Basket Component: $100.00*

*The hypothetical Initial Component Value of $100.00 for each Basket Component has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual Initial Component Values for the Basket Components. The actual Initial Component Value for each Basket Component is set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

For information regarding recent values of the Basket Components, please see “Information Regarding the Basket Components” in this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The Basket Return is 90.00%.

Basket Component Initial Component Value Final Component Value Basket Component Return KO Basket Component $100.00 $200.00 100.00% PG Basket Component $100.00 $180.00 80.00% VZ Basket Component $100.00 $190.00 90.00%

Step 1: Calculate the Final Basket Value.

The Final Basket Value is calculated as follows:

100 × [1 + (1/3 × 100.00%) + (1/3 × 80.00%) + (1/3 × 90.00%)] = 190.00

Therefore, the Final Basket Value is 190.00, resulting in a Basket Return of 90.00%.

PS- 7

Step 2: Calculate the payment at maturity.

Because the Final Basket Value is greater than the Initial Basket Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,266.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) Basket Return × Upside Leverage Factor and (b) Maximum Return)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) 90.00% × 3.00 and (b) 26.60%)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 26.60%) = $1,266.00

Example 1 demonstrates that you may not participate in the full appreciation of the Basket. Even though the Basket appreciated significantly, the payment at maturity is limited to $1,266.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, which is the maximum payment on the Notes.

Example 2: The Basket Return is 5.00%.

Basket Component Initial Component Value Final Component Value Basket Component Return KO Basket Component $100.00 $109.00 9.00% PG Basket Component $100.00 $104.00 4.00% VZ Basket Component $100.00 $102.00 2.00%

Step 1: Calculate the Final Basket Value.

The Final Basket Value is calculated as follows:

100 × [1 + (1/3 × 9.00%) + (1/3 × 4.00%) + (1/3 × 2.00%)] = 105.00

Therefore, the Final Basket Value is 105.00, resulting in a Basket Return of 5.00%.

Step 2: Calculate the payment at maturity.

Because the Final Basket Value is greater than the Initial Basket Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,150.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) Basket Return × Upside Leverage Factor and (b) Maximum Return)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) 5.00% × 3.00 and (b) 26.60%)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 15.00%) = $1,150.00

Example 3: The Basket Return is -50.00%.

Basket Component Initial Component Value Final Component Value Basket Component Return KO Basket Component $100.00 $80.00 -20.00% PG Basket Component $100.00 $50.00 -50.00% VZ Basket Component $100.00 $20.00 -80.00%

Step 1: Calculate the Final Basket Value.

The Final Basket Value is calculated as follows:

100 × [1 + (1/3 × -20.00%) + (1/3 × -50.00%) + (1/3 × -80.00%)] = 50.00

Therefore, the Final Basket Value is 50.00, resulting in a Basket Return of -50.00%.

Step 2: Calculate the payment at maturity.

Because the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Basket Return)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × -50.00%) = $500.00

Example 3 demonstrates that, if the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Basket from the Initial Basket Value.

You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC.

Selected Risk Considerations

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Basket Components. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

·Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Basket from the Initial Basket Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

·Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Maximum Return—Any positive return on your Notes will not exceed a predetermined percentage of the principal amount, regardless of any appreciation in the value of the Basket, which may be significant. We refer to this percentage as the Maximum Return, which is equal to 26.60%. Your return on the Notes will be less than the percentage change from the Initial Basket Value to the Final Basket Value if such percentage is greater than the Maximum Return.

·No Interest Payments—As a holder of the Notes, you will not receive interest payments.

·The Performance of the Basket Components May Offset Each Other; Correlation (or Lack of Correlation) Among the Basket Components May Adversely Affect the Return on the Notes—The Basket Return will be calculated based on the weighted average performance of the Basket Components, as described on the cover of this pricing supplement. The lesser performance of some Basket Components will mitigate, and may completely offset, the greater performance of other Basket Components. You may lose a significant portion of your investment even if one or more Basket Components performs positively.

Correlation is a measure of the degree to which the returns of a pair of assets are similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. Movements in the values of the Basket Components may not correlate with each other. At a time when the value of a Basket Component increases in value, the value of other Basket Components may not increase as much or may even decline in value. In addition, high correlation of movements in the values of Basket Components could adversely affect your return during periods of decline for the Basket Components. Changes in the values of the Basket Components and/or the correlation among them may adversely affect the market value of, and any payments on, your Notes.

·Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Basket Components on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Basket Components on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Basket Components determined at any other time.

·Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Basket Components—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the Basket Components. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the Basket Components would have.

·The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain—There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the Notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Tax Considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the Notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

·Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

·You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the

PS- 9

holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Basket Components

·There Are Risks Associated with Single Equities—The price of each Basket Component can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to that Basket Component and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of each Basket Component.

·Anti-dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-dilution Adjustments—The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of a Basket Component. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect a Basket Component. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect the market price of, and any amounts payable on, the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·Reorganization or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated—Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of a Basket Component, the Calculation Agent may replace that Basket Component with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of that Basket Component upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent or may make other changes to the terms of the Notes to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the Calculation Agent to replace a Basket Component, to accelerate the Notes or to otherwise adjust the terms of the Notes could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the Notes than if the Calculation Agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or a Basket Component, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·Historical Performance of the Basket Components Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Basket Components Over the Term of the Notes—The value of each Basket Component has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Basket Component is not an indication of the future performance of that Basket Component over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation between the Basket Components is not an indication of the future correlation between them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Basket Components over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any of the Basket Components.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

·We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Basket Components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Basket Components and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Basket Components” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

·Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

·Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market prices of, dividend rates on and expected volatility of the Basket Components;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the Basket Components;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

PS- 11

·The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

·The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes—Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

Tax Considerations

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the Basket Components. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss on your Notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your Notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of Notes at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

We have agreed to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent commits to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.

VALIDITY OF THE NOTES

In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special United States products counsel to Barclays Bank PLC, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement have been issued by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the indenture, the trustee has made, in accordance with instructions from Barclays Bank PLC, appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such Notes (the “master note”), and such Notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be valid and binding obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith) and possible judicial or regulatory actions or application giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws affecting creditors’ rights, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of the stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by English law, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP has relied, with Barclays Bank PLC’s permission, on the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP, dated as of May 15, 2025, filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form F-3ASR by Barclays Bank PLC on May 15, 2025, and this opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations as set forth in such opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the master note and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, dated May 15, 2025, which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement referred to above.

Today's Featured Research Reports

Amazon.com’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+4.5% vs. +2.4%). The company’s international expansion and diversification across e-commerce, AWS cloud services, advertising, and streaming create multiple revenue streams while reducing concentration risk.

Management's Q4 2025 guidance projects net sales of $206-$213 billion with operating income between $21-$26 billion, reflecting operational efficiency gains. AI integration across operations enhances personalization, logistics and AWS offerings, strengthening competitive positioning. The Zacks analyst expect 2025 net sales to grow 10.6% from 2024.

However, substantial capital expenditure requirements for AI infrastructure and data centers strain financial resources and compress margins. The company's expanding debt burden reduces financial flexibility amid rising interest rates. Intensifying competition from Walmart, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud is an overhang.

Shares of Palantir have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past six months (+32.3% vs. -6.5%). The company’s AI strategy, driven by Foundry, Gotham, and AIP platforms, targets government and commercial sectors, enabling real-time insights and operational efficiency. Notable defense projects, like Open DAGIR and AIP boot camps for commercial clients, boost customer acquisition.

With $5.4 billion in cash, no debt, and S&P 500 inclusion, Palantir enjoys strong liquidity, growing revenues, and increased investor visibility. Meanwhile, PLTR's reluctance to pay dividends is a green flag for dividend-seeking investors.

Intense competition from tech giants and rising costs amidst a rapidly evolving AI landscape and an elevated valuation challenge its appeal. Palantir shares have gained 122.5% in a year, and we have a neutral rating on it in anticipation of a correction.

TotalEnergies’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past six months (+5.9% vs. +1.7%). The company is gaining from contributions coming from startups, acquired assets, well-spread LNG assets and upstream assets located in the new hydrocarbon-producing regions. Contributions from multi-energy assets spread across the globe boost its earnings.

TotalEnergies’ free cash flow allows it to increase shareholders’ value. Cost reduction initiatives will boost margins and the company aims to generate 15-20% of sales from low-carbon business by 2040. TotalEnergies is investing in clean power generation and lowering emissions.

Yet TotalEnergies operates multiple assets globally, and in some regions, production might be impacted due to security concerns. It remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production.

(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>>)

Shares of MIND Technology have gained +11.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Technology Services industry’s gain of +15.4%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $79.44 million shows improving near-term visibility, with a $9.5 million seismic contract secured in December 2025, highlighting product demand. Recent expansion of its Huntsville facility supports higher-margin throughput and positions the firm for complex project growth.

New capital flexibility via a $25 million ATM offering and $4 million repurchase program enhances strategic agility. MIND benefits from exposure to a resilient global marine seismic market and operates a globally diversified footprint, aiding responsiveness and contract wins.

However, declining revenue and backlog highlight demand volatility, and a growing reliance on aftermarket sales may limit long-term upside. Profitability is pressured by modestly rising operating expenses. Despite this, shares are up 13.7% in the past year, and valuation remains attractive at 1.1X EV/Sales and 7.87X EV/EBITDA, well below peers.

Is the recent softness in Michelin stock just normal profit taking after a strong run, or an early warning that the market is losing faith in the recovery story of the French tire giant?

Latest insights, strategy and corporate profile of Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin in English

Market Pulse: Price, Trend and Volatility Check

According to live quotes from Yahoo Finance and Google Finance, which align on the figures, Michelin stock (ISIN FR001400AJ45, traded in Paris under the ticker ML or ML.PA) last closed at approximately 30.6 euros per share. This last close reflects trading in the Paris session and represents the most recent official price, not an intraday guess. Over the last five trading days, the stock has edged modestly lower, fluctuating in a relatively tight band around the low 30 euro level.

The five day picture shows small daily moves rather than dramatic swings. After starting the period close to 31 euros, the share slipped fractionally in the following sessions, with mild intraday recoveries unable to push it decisively higher. The net result is a low single digit percentage decline over those five days, a pattern that points more to consolidation than capitulation. Volumes have been around or slightly below recent averages, again suggesting a market catching its breath rather than rushing for the exits.

Step back to a 90 day horizon and the tone shifts from slightly cautious to quietly optimistic. From early autumn levels in the mid to high 20s, Michelin stock has climbed a respectable mid to high teens percentage, outpacing many traditional auto related names. That rally has been punctuated by short pauses and shallow pullbacks, which is exactly what technicians like to see in a healthy uptrend. The current dip therefore looks, for now, like another pause inside a broader positive channel.

In the context of the last year, the stock is also trading comfortably above its 52 week low and below but not dramatically far from its 52 week high. Public data from finance portals shows a 52 week range that roughly spans the low 20 euro area at the bottom up to the low or mid 30s at the top. With the last close around 30.6 euros, Michelin is sitting in the upper half of that range, a level that usually reflects cautious optimism rather than outright euphoria.

One-Year Investment Performance

Imagine an investor who decided exactly one year ago to back Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin, placing a calculated bet that the tire maker could navigate slowing global auto demand, raw material cost swings and the messy transition to electric vehicles. Based on historical price data from Yahoo Finance and corroborated by Google Finance, the stock traded near roughly 27.5 euros around that time. Comparing that reference level with the latest close around 30.6 euros implies a gain in the region of 11 percent over twelve months, before dividends.

For a blue chip industrial stock, an approximate 11 percent capital gain in a year is far from spectacular, yet it is anything but trivial. In practical terms, a hypothetical 10,000 euro investment would now be worth about 11,100 euros, excluding any dividend income Michelin distributed along the way. The psychological impact of that performance depends very much on the investor’s expectations. For someone who feared a deeper downturn in the auto and tire cycle, this outcome feels like a quiet victory. For a more aggressive investor who hoped for a roaring post pandemic upswing, the trajectory might look frustratingly measured.

The key emotional takeaway is that Michelin stock has rewarded patience without forcing investors to stomach violent volatility. The ride has involved bouts of nervousness when concerns flared about European growth or Chinese demand, but the overall direction has been gently upward. That combination of moderate gain and limited drama is precisely why conservative portfolios often give industrial champions like Michelin a permanent seat at the table.

Recent Catalysts and News

Newsflow around Michelin in the very short term has been relatively muted, with no blockbuster mergers or shock profit warnings hitting the tape in the past several sessions. Instead, the story has revolved around incremental updates that underscore the group’s steady, methodical repositioning. Company communications and financial coverage have continued to emphasize Michelin’s focus on higher value tires, services and solutions, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. In the most recent management commentary, leadership reiterated guidance that prioritizes margin resilience over sheer volume growth, a stance that resonates with investors wary of a late cycle environment.

Earlier this week, regional business press and financial portals highlighted ongoing progress in Michelin’s strategy to expand beyond traditional tires into mobility services, specialty materials and digital platforms for fleet management. Although none of these strands is individually transformational yet, together they form a narrative that Michelin is trying to decouple its earnings profile from the most cyclical parts of the auto industry. This matters because markets currently reward companies that can prove they are not just passengers in the economic cycle but active drivers of value through pricing power and product mix.

Within the last several days, analysts and commentators have also revisited Michelin’s cost base and supply chain positioning in light of stabilizing raw material prices. Lower volatility in input costs such as natural rubber and energy has been cited as a supporting factor for margins, reducing one of the key external risks that haunted the sector in previous years. At the same time, investors are closely watching bookings and commentary from automakers, since replacement tire demand and original equipment volumes remain closely linked to the broader health of global vehicle sales.

Because there have been no dramatic new headlines over roughly the past week, the chart itself is telling the story. The current trading pattern looks like a classic consolidation phase with low to moderate volatility. After a respectable multi month advance, short term traders are locking in gains while longer term holders seem content to sit tight, awaiting the next decisive catalyst such as quarterly earnings or a fresh update on capital return plans. In that sense, the silence in the news flow is less a red flag and more an indication that the market is pausing to reassess fair value.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Fresh research notes over the past month from major houses underscore a broadly constructive but not euphoric stance toward Michelin stock. Refinitiv and financial press summaries cite firms such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, UBS and others as generally rating the shares in the Buy or Overweight camp, with a minority of Hold or Neutral recommendations and very few outright Sell calls. Recent target prices reported in the financial media cluster in a corridor around the mid 30 euro zone, implying mid to high single digit upside from the latest close, with some more optimistic houses seeing room for a move closer to the high 30s if execution remains on track.

Goldman Sachs, according to recent coverage, has maintained a positive stance based on Michelin’s pricing discipline and exposure to premium segments, arguing that these attributes support above cycle margins even if unit volumes remain under pressure. J.P. Morgan, in more cautious language, has pointed to macro uncertainties and the risk of softer demand in Europe but has still refrained from a bearish call, instead preferring a neutral to mildly supportive posture. Deutsche Bank and UBS commentary picked up by European financial outlets tends to highlight the attractive free cash flow yield and the potential for continued shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks.

Rolling these viewpoints together, the de facto Wall Street verdict could be summarized as a soft Buy: analysts, on average, believe the shares are modestly undervalued relative to their medium term earnings power, but no one is promising a rapid rerating. Price targets suggest that the easy gains of the early recovery phase are likely behind the stock, and that the next leg up, if it comes, will depend on Michelin’s ability to sustain margins while navigating a choppy macro environment. For investors, this means expectations are neither extremely low nor dangerously high, which reduces the risk of violent repricing on incremental news.

Future Prospects and Strategy

At its core, Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin remains a global leader in tires, with strong positions in passenger cars, trucks, specialty applications such as mining and aviation, and a growing suite of services that includes fleet management, digital mobility tools and high performance materials. The strategy is clear: lean into segments where technology, safety and durability command a premium, and gradually reduce exposure to commoditized, low margin products. This is a playbook designed to carve out pricing power in an industry that has often been treated by markets as a low growth, highly cyclical commodity business.

Looking ahead to the coming months, several factors will likely determine how the stock trades. First, global auto and truck production trends remain a critical swing variable. Any renewed weakness in Europe or a sharper slowdown in China could weigh on sentiment, even if Michelin’s premium focus softens the blow. Second, cost discipline and supply chain resilience will continue to be scrutinized; investors have little patience for negative surprises on margins after years of raw material volatility. Third, the pace at which the company scales its non tire businesses, from connected fleet services to advanced materials, will influence how the market values Michelin’s long term growth profile.

There is also a structural storyline around sustainability and regulation. Stricter environmental standards push customers toward higher performance, longer lasting tires, which plays to Michelin’s strengths but also demands ongoing investment in research and development. Investors will be watching closely to see if those investments translate into visible pricing power and above peer returns on capital. If management continues to deliver incremental margin expansion and reliable cash flows, the market could gradually reward the stock with a higher valuation multiple. If, on the other hand, growth in key end markets stalls and non tire ventures fail to move the needle, the shares could remain locked in a range, acting more as a dependable income play than a growth story.

For now, the balance of evidence points to a measured, moderately bullish outlook. The recent five day softness in Michelin stock looks less like the beginning of a breakdown and more like a breather after a solid 90 day advance. Analysts are still leaning positive, the one year investment outcome has been quietly rewarding, and the company’s strategic pivot toward premium, service rich offerings is intact. The real question for investors is not whether Michelin can survive the next cycle, but whether it can convince the market that its earnings profile deserves a premium valuation. The answer to that will unfold one cautious quarter at a time.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405008_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 17:01:04.199536

OpenAI bought Ive’s design startup, io Products, for $6.5 billion in May 2025, with the explicit goal of creating a new generation of AI-powered devices. In the months since, rumors have circulated that the devices would eschew screens in favor of an audio-based operating system, in the form of a pair of smart glasses or an Amazon Echo-like speaker.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman further added to those rumors during a December 2025 interview with journalist Alex Kantrowitz, in which he said that using a screen would limit OpenAI’s device to “the same way we’ve had graphical user interfaces working for many decades.”

During a presentation in summer 2025, according to the Information, researchers working on the devices told OpenAI staff that the company’s initial device will process information about its surroundings through audio and video, and “act like a companion that works alongside its user, proactively giving suggestions to help the user achieve their goals, rather than as a simple conduit to apps and other software.”

In practice, the device sounds remarkably similar to the one featured in the 2015 film Her. In that film, humans wear devices that allow their AI companions to see and hear the world, while providing commentary through an earpiece.

Put a Bow on It

The star upgrade of 2025 was the arrival of NVIDIA Blackwell RTX in the cloud, bringing GeForce RTX 5080 power to the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier along with all the NVIDIA technologies that 50 Series GPU owners have access to, including DLSS 4 and 5K 120 frames-per-second (FPS) streaming. ""The amazing announcement of the RTX 5080 being added to GeForce NOW with features like DLSS 4 and 5K 120 FPS streaming was a true game-changer for cloud gaming,"" said Nads from Cloud&Console. Luna, a GeForce NOW Discord community modder, called out how the Ultimate tier let her go topside in ARC Raiders and explore Castor Woods in Dying Light: The Beast ""in areas where my local machine struggles - and now, the RTX 5080-powered cloud can push them even further."" GeForce NOW had major day-and-date launches of blockbuster titles including ARC Raiders and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - and the community packed in some unforgettable sessions to celebrate. Nads summed up the smoothness: ""Vaulting into Borderlands 4, surviving Grounded with friends and diving into Battlefield 6 chaos - all of it was seamless on GeForce NOW this year.""

For Warwick, cloud gaming turned into a superpower: ""I've always struggled to play Fortnite with my friends while streaming, but with GeForce NOW, I've been able to jump straight in with ease and get those victory royales,"" the gamer said. One highlight of their year was seeing ""all the incredible things coming to GeForce NOW at Gamescom, including Fortnite with Discord - game changer!"" 2025 belonged to members who play literally anywhere. The native GeForce NOW app elevated gaming on Steam Deck, making it easier than ever to play the cloud gaming platform's 2,000+ supported games from Steam, Epic Games Store, Game Pass and more - all at GeForce RTX quality on the handheld device.

Anytime Anywhere Gaming gave a shoutout to ""the release of ARC Raiders and continued Steam Deck support,"" calling it ""nothing short of amazing"" to take on raiders and play beloved titles on Steam Deck ""at max fidelity.""

The Install-to-Play feature brought even more titles to members. ""Install-to-Play has brought in so many games,"" said creator Cloudy With Games. ""Take a gamble on Slots and Daggers, it's worth it."" Creator RuDiggz put it this way: ""Install-to-Play breathes new life into favorites like Pixelmancer, mobilizing indies with the cloud from my desktop to my phone on the go."" For those chasing maximum freedom and fidelity, he added, ""GeForce NOW Ultimate is the only way to play thousands of titles at max settings - no hardware minimums. GeForce NOW has the frames and the games.""

The Ultimate Winners

The Ultimate Contest gave members a chance to share their favorite cloud gaming moments and show off what GeForce RTX 5080-class power can do. From stunning action moments to creative showcases, the submissions proved why the Ultimate experience stands out.

A huge ""GG"" to our top 10 winners: pfoglista, danipeter007+gfn, brunocas_300, Studmuffin9398, patanaimuje, dufranklin4, despandan4, chandabenr, andreaosmani222 and Lyreliarlyre. Those who joined in earned two Ultimate Day Passes - one to enjoy and one to share with a friend - plus one year of an Ultimate membership.

Pfoglista's video really captured how GeForce NOW Ultimate ""feels exactly like playing on a local PC,"" highlighting how fast, competitive, low‑latency cloud gaming can look and feel every bit as precise as playing on a local high‑end rig.

Who Are Edwards Lifesciences’ Top Shareholders?

Edwards Lifesciences’ shareholder base is led by major passive institutions. These firms tend to hold through market cycles, which can help keep long term ownership stable. Active managers adjusted in both directions, pointing to a mix of conviction and valuation discipline.

The Vanguard Group: 70.09M shares (12.08%), ~$6.0B value. Added 359,015 shares (+0.51%).

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company: 30.52M shares (5.26%), ~$2.6B value. Cut 370,162 shares (1.20%).

State Street Investment Management: 25.62M shares (4.41%), ~$2.2B value. Cut 14,746 shares (0.06%).

Wellington Management Company: 20.80M shares (3.59%), ~$1.8B value. Added 977,933 shares (+4.93%).

J.P. Morgan Asset Management: 17.92M shares (3.09%), ~$1.5B value. Cut 2.17M shares (10.80%).

Jennison Associates: 13.96M shares (2.41%), ~$1.2B value. Added 2.29M shares (+19.60%).

Walter Scott & Partners: 9.96M shares (1.72%), ~$849M value. Added 1.05M shares (+11.73%).

Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH: 8.60M shares (1.48%), ~$734M value. Added 19,169 shares (+0.22%).

The presence of large passive holders provides a stable ownership base, while selective buying and trimming among active managers suggests investors are closely weighing valuation and execution. For investors, this ownership mix signals continued institutional engagement without a clear consensus shift.

Hedge Fund Highlights

Squarepoint Ops LLC, founded by Guilherme Schmid, increased its Edwards Lifesciences position by about 228%, bringing its stake to roughly $17.7M value. The move may reflect growing optimism around structural heart procedure volumes.

Jane Street Group, co-founded by Rob Granieri, boosted its holdings by around 183% and now owns approximately $121M value of Edwards Lifesciences stock, making it one of the larger active hedge fund positions.

Kingdon Capital Management, led by founder Mark Kingdon, lifted its stake by about 175% to roughly $19.6M value, a notable increase following recent share price volatility.

Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, founded by Steven Schonfeld, raised its position by around 77% to approximately $16.8M value. For investors, hedge fund activity appears selectively constructive, though positioning remains diversified rather than concentrated.

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-02 17:45:45+00:00,The National CIO Review,Why OpenAI Is Betting That Voice Will Replace the Screen - The National CIO Review,Emily Hill,,,,,https://nationalcioreview.com/articles-insights/extra-bytes/why-openai-is-betting-that-voice-will-replace-the-screen/,"Over the past couple of months, it’s reorganized key teams across research, product, and engineering to focus on building smarter, more conversational voice technology.

Over the past couple of months, it’s reorganized key teams across research, product, and engineering to focus on building smarter, more conversational voice technology. While the focus is on making ChatGPT sound better, it’s also on laying the groundwork for a new kind of device that could arrive in 2026, which won’t have a screen at all.

Across the tech industry, there’s growing momentum behind voice as the next big way we interact with machines.

From smart glasses that help you hear better in noisy rooms to cars with built-in conversational assistants, the idea that talking might soon replace tapping and swiping is becoming more and more prevalent. And for companies building products or platforms, it’s a shift that could change everything from how software is designed to how users expect to get things done.

Why It Matters: We’re entering an era where voice is becoming the interface. As AI gets better at understanding us and responding in natural conversation, there’s a huge opportunity to rethink how people interact with technology. That shift could unlock new use cases in work, mobility, and everyday life, especially in places where screens get in the way.

OpenAI Is Restructuring Around Voice: The company is investing heavily in audio, aiming to build models that sound more natural and feel more like talking to a person than a bot. The next version of its voice model will reportedly handle things like interruptions and talking over each other, things that make real conversation feel real. That’s a big leap from today’s rigid, turn-by-turn voice assistants.

A New Kind of Device Is on the Way: OpenAI is working on a screenless personal device that would let people interact entirely through speech. It might take the form of smart glasses or a small, always-on speaker, the kind of thing that lives in the background, ready to help without demanding attention. Think less like a tool you use and more like a presence that’s just there when you need it.

The Big Tech Players Are Thinking the Same Way: OpenAI isn’t alone. Meta’s smart glasses now use a five-microphone setup to help users hear better in loud environments. Google is turning search results into spoken summaries. Tesla is integrating a voice assistant into its cars so drivers can control everything from directions to temperature just by talking.

Startups Are Betting on Voice-First Wearables: Smaller companies are racing to build screenless AI devices, from pins that clip to your shirt to rings you can talk to. Some, like the Humane AI Pin, have already run into trouble. But others, including one backed by Pebble’s founder, are gearing up to launch in 2026. These products are trying to build a new category of always-there, voice-first tech.

Design That Fades Into the Background: A big part of this shift is about reducing how much attention technology demands. Jony Ive, Apple’s former design chief, is helping shape OpenAI’s hardware strategy. His vision is to create tools that are less addictive, more ambient, and better integrated into everyday life. It’s a rethink of how tech should behave, not shouting for attention, just quietly helping when needed.",https://nationalcioreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_578383535-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-02 14:00:21.808615

This also means BMW has now taken full control of the Alpina name, and some excerpts from its press release give a hint as to what it plans to do with it: Key elements of the BMW ALPINA brand are its unique balance of maximum performance and superior ride comfort, combined with hallmark driving characteristics.
BMW ALPINA vehicles are manufactured according to rigorous standards for materials selection and craftsmanship.
These ensure that every BMW ALPINA has its own, unmistakeable character.
The next X7/iX7 and refreshed 7 Series are most likely the first candidates to get this BMW Alpina treatment.","In 2022, BMW announced that it had come to an agreement to fully acquire Alpina, the German tuning house long associated with producing exquisitely modified BMWs focused on grand touring comfort and power. At the time, BMW and Alpina had an agreement to continue collaborating as they had in the past until the end of 2025, with full rights to the name transferring at the end of that year.

Well, it’s now 2026, and that means that Alpina is fully part of BMW. What does that mean, you ask? Well, a few things. The Bovensiepen family—the ones behind Alpina—and the team in Buchloe are still active, but are now working under the family name to create bespoke, modified BMWs. The first one was shown at Villa d’Este, and it’s the Bovensiepen Zagato (pictured below), an M4 convertible-based pillarless coupe with more power and a body from legendary Italian designer Zagato.

This also means BMW has now taken full control of the Alpina name, and some excerpts from its press release give a hint as to what it plans to do with it:

Key elements of the BMW ALPINA brand are its unique balance of maximum performance and superior ride comfort, combined with hallmark driving characteristics. This is complemented by an exclusive portfolio of bespoke options and custom materials along with unmistakeable details.

The new wordmark provides a first indication. It radiates clarity, calm and confidence. Positioned at the centre of the rear, it underlines the standalone character of the new exclusive brand and its independent personality within the BMW Group.

BMW ALPINA vehicles are manufactured according to rigorous standards for materials selection and craftsmanship. They fulfill the most demanding expectations in terms of visuals, acoustics and feel. Moreover, buyers can choose from a remarkable portfolio of bespoke options. These ensure that every BMW ALPINA has its own, unmistakeable character. Each vehicle will be an exclusive object for connoisseurs in pursuit of the extraordinary, without compromises on performance, comfort and individuality.

It’s no longer a trim level, but a brand within the group, one that will seemingly continue to provide the balance of luxury and power Alpina has been known for. However, BMW will also integrate Alpina more deeply into the development process, there is an in-house designer, and it’s likely that models that receive the Alpina treatment will feature deeper changes to powertrain, options, interior, and even styling, than before. The goal appears to be to create a luxury brand above BMW but below Rolls-Royce, sort of like how Mercedes now uses the Maybach brand.

The next X7/iX7 and refreshed 7 Series are most likely the first candidates to get this BMW Alpina treatment. Let’s see what they come up with.",https://bimmerlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023_BMW_ALPINA_XB7-12-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 05:58:00.485354

While Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen defended the prices by pointing to the complex web of rebates demanded by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), the public outcry set the stage for a dramatic policy shift.
Investors should watch for a potential ""race to the bottom"" in pricing as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly attempt to lock in long-term contracts with private insurers before newer competitors like Amgen’s MariTide reach the market in 2028.
In January 2026, Novo Nordisk launched its high-dose oral Wegovy pill, priced aggressively at $149 for the introductory month.
By embracing lower-cost vials, direct-to-consumer platforms, and government negotiations, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have traded high per-unit margins for a dominant, long-term share of a much larger market.","As the calendar turns to 2026, the landscape for weight-loss and diabetes medication has been fundamentally transformed. What began two years ago as a ""wild west"" of $1,000-a-month list prices and chronic shortages has evolved into a highly competitive, government-influenced market where affordability and accessibility have finally taken center stage. For the millions of Americans utilizing GLP-1 therapies, the start of 2026 marks the first full year where these life-altering drugs are no longer a luxury exclusive to the wealthy or the well-insured.

The strategic pivot by pharmaceutical titans Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) represents one of the most significant shifts in drug pricing dynamics in modern history. Driven by a combination of intense legislative pressure from the U.S. Senate, the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and a surge in competition from next-generation therapies, these companies have moved away from high-margin scarcity toward a high-volume, mass-market model. This transition is not merely a corporate rebranding; it is a structural overhaul of the American pharmaceutical economy.

The Road to Affordability: A Two-Year Siege on High Prices

The journey to the current pricing environment was catalyzed by a series of high-stakes confrontations throughout 2024 and 2025. In late 2024, Senator Bernie Sanders and the Senate HELP Committee placed Novo Nordisk in the crosshairs, citing studies that suggested blockbuster drugs like Ozempic could be manufactured for less than $5 per month. While Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen defended the prices by pointing to the complex web of rebates demanded by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), the public outcry set the stage for a dramatic policy shift.

The real turning point arrived in late 2025, when the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized the first round of price negotiations for semaglutide under the IRA. In November 2025, the government announced a negotiated ""Maximum Fair Price"" of $274 for a 30-day supply of Novo’s semaglutide products—a staggering 71% discount from previous list prices. Although these prices are not slated to take effect for Medicare beneficiaries until January 1, 2027, the announcement created an immediate ""price floor"" that forced commercial insurers and Eli Lilly to respond in kind to remain competitive.

Simultaneously, Eli Lilly upended the market by aggressively expanding its direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect. By December 2025, Lilly had slashed the price of its single-dose Zepbound vials to as low as $299 per month for self-paying patients, effectively bypassing the traditional PBM-led distribution model. This ""vial strategy"" served a dual purpose: it bypassed the manufacturing bottlenecks associated with complex autoinjector pens and directly undercut the burgeoning market for compounded versions of the drug.

Winners and Losers in the New GLP-1 Economy

The clear winners in this new era are patients and large-scale employers who have struggled to fund weight-loss coverage. With the average cash price for branded GLP-1s now hovering between $299 and $350—down from over $1,000 in early 2024—insurance coverage has expanded rapidly. Major insurers like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) and Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) have begun reintroducing these drugs into standard formularies, betting that the long-term savings from reduced cardiovascular and diabetic complications will outweigh the current cost of the medication.

Conversely, the ""Golden Age"" of GLP-1 compounding has come to an abrupt halt. Companies like Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (NYSE: HIMS) saw their stock prices under pressure throughout 2025 as the FDA officially removed semaglutide and tirzepatide from the shortage list. With the branded versions now readily available and priced competitively, the legal ""safe harbor"" for compounding pharmacies has narrowed significantly. Furthermore, the introduction of the SAFE Drugs Act in late 2025 has imposed stricter regulations on mass-produced compounded GLP-1s, forcing these companies to pivot toward older, off-patent molecules like Liraglutide.

Traditional PBMs, including CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), are also facing a strategic crisis. The shift toward transparent, direct-to-consumer pricing models like LillyDirect and the government-backed TrumpRx platform threatens the ""rebate-heavy"" model that has long sustained PBM profits. As pharmaceutical companies find ways to sell directly to the public at lower prices, the role of the middleman is being scrutinized more than ever by both regulators and corporate clients.

A Global Paradigm Shift in Drug Policy

The pricing shifts of 2025 represent more than just a market correction; they signify a broader trend toward global pricing parity. For years, the U.S. market subsidized drug development for the rest of the world by paying significantly higher prices. However, the 2025 ""Most Favored Nation"" agreements—where the U.S. government leveraged its massive purchasing power to demand prices closer to those seen in Europe—have effectively ended this era of American exceptionalism in drug costs.

This event also highlights the success of the Inflation Reduction Act's negotiation provisions. The $274 negotiated price for Ozempic has become a benchmark that other nations are now using in their own negotiations, creating a global ripple effect. Competitors like Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) are now being forced to design their Phase 3 trials and commercial strategies around this lower price point, rather than the inflated list prices of the past. The ""innovation premium"" is now being tied more strictly to clinical outcomes—such as monthly dosing or superior weight loss—rather than mere market entry.

Historically, this shift is reminiscent of the ""Generic Revolution"" of the early 2000s, but with a twist. Instead of waiting for patents to expire, the combined weight of government intervention and ""vial-based"" competition has created a ""pseudo-generic"" environment for branded drugs that are still years away from their patent cliffs. This is a new precedent in the pharmaceutical industry: the aggressive commoditization of a blockbuster drug class while it is still under patent.

The Road Ahead: Orals, Combinations, and the 2027 Cliff

Looking toward the remainder of 2026 and into 2027, the market is bracing for the ""Medicare Cliff."" When the $274 negotiated price officially hits the Medicare Part D books in January 2027, the pressure on the commercial market to match that price will be immense. Investors should watch for a potential ""race to the bottom"" in pricing as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly attempt to lock in long-term contracts with private insurers before newer competitors like Amgen’s MariTide reach the market in 2028.

Another major strategic pivot is the shift toward oral GLP-1s. In January 2026, Novo Nordisk launched its high-dose oral Wegovy pill, priced aggressively at $149 for the introductory month. This move is designed to capture the ""needle-phobic"" segment of the market and defend against Viking Therapeutics' promising oral candidate, which is currently in late-stage trials. The battle for the medicine cabinet is moving from the refrigerator (for injectables) to the pill bottle, which significantly reduces shipping and storage costs for the manufacturers.

Strategic adaptations will also be required in the manufacturing sector. As prices drop, volume must increase to maintain revenue growth. Both Lilly and Novo have committed tens of billions of dollars to new manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Ireland, which are expected to reach full capacity by late 2026. The challenge will be maintaining these massive operations if pricing continues to erode faster than volume can expand—a delicate balancing act that will define their stock performance over the next 24 months.

Summary of the New Market Reality

The strategic shifts of 2024 and 2025 have fundamentally broken the old pricing model for GLP-1 drugs. By embracing lower-cost vials, direct-to-consumer platforms, and government negotiations, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have traded high per-unit margins for a dominant, long-term share of a much larger market. The ""Net Cash Price"" of approximately $350 has become the new standard, effectively ending the era of the $1,000 weight-loss shot for the vast majority of Americans.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by ""Volume over Value."" While the astronomical growth rates seen in 2023 might slow as pricing stabilizes, the total addressable market is expanding as the drugs become affordable for the middle class. Investors should keep a close eye on the quarterly volume growth of Wegovy and Zepbound, as well as the clinical progress of oral competitors.

The lasting impact of this event is a blueprint for future drug launches. The days of launching a blockbuster drug with an unchecked price tag in the U.S. appear to be over. In its place is a more disciplined, politically sensitive, and transparent market—one where the price of health is no longer determined solely by what the market will bear, but by what the public and the government will permit.

Retain Value: They hold value based on their metal content and their rarity as collectibles. ""They retain value as collectibles and by their metal content.""

Graded Coins: Authenticity and quality can be verified through grading, reducing guesswork. ""Graded coins take the guesswork out of authenticity and quality.""

Historical Connection: Some investors appreciate the tangible connection to history. ""I’m optimistic on coins because of their tangible connection to history and a bull market in precious metals.""

Cons:

Aging Demographics: The market for some collectible coins may be affected by an aging collector base. ""Risks include an aging demographic (much like the fate of stamp collectors) and buyers premiums.""

Buyer's Premiums: You might pay a premium over the metal's spot price.

Rare Earth Metals

Investing in rare earth metals can be a strategic move given their importance in modern technology and geopolitics.

Pros:

High Demand: Essential for electronics, renewable energy, and defense systems. ""American sourced rare earth miners ought to have a great tailwind in this administration.""

Geopolitical Significance: Governments are investing in domestic supply chains, which could boost value. ""Governments globally are investing heavily into increasing REE supply independent of Chinese processing for strategic/geopolitical reasons rather than expectation of profits.""

Cons:

Market Volatility: Prices can be heavily influenced by political decisions and international relations. ""Depends on the XI / Trump meeting - Rare Earths could rocket or tank depending on the Tweet that comes out of that meeting.""

Supply and Demand Imbalance: Increased supply without matching demand can lead to price crashes. ""Any commodity that sees a dramatic increase in supply without a matching increase in demand has its price crash, margins vanish, and once-exciting projects sputter and die.""

Physical Gold and Silver

Holding physical gold and silver is often seen as a hedge against economic instability.

Pros:

Insurance Against Financial Instability: Acts as a safe haven during economic downturns. ""the rationale behind holding physical gold is that it serves as a form of insurance -- you have direct custody of your wealth, independent of third parties.""

Historical Value: Has been used as money for thousands of years, suggesting long-term value preservation. ""Historically, gold and silver have been used as money for thousands of years.""

Counterparty Risk Reduction: Direct ownership eliminates the risk associated with third-party intermediaries. ""The physical is a hedge against capital controls, risk of your broker becoming insolvent, among other things.""

Cons:

Storage and Security: Requires secure storage, which can be costly or risky.

Less Liquid: Selling physical metals can be more cumbersome and may involve high margins from dealers. ""The shops near me that buy and sell precious metals are buying silver at a 65% margin!""

In August, Hormel Foods, Austin, Minn., said an unexpected rise in the costs of pork, beef and nuts undermined the company’s performance during its third quarter.
Approximately 80% of consumers report prioritizing protein intake during one meal a day, with the majority prioritizing protein during the dinner occasion.
In examining the most common perceived benefits associated with protein most consumers link protein with muscle health and strength.
In September, the US Department of Agriculture lowered second-half 2025 pork production by 180 million lbs due to lower-than-expected availability of slaughter-ready hogs.","KANSAS CITY — The rising cost of meat proteins rippled through the supply chain in 2025. Companies like Conagra Brands, Inc., and Hormel Foods Corp., manufacturers of prepared products that feature meat proteins, were stung by the higher costs. Driving the market dynamics have been increased consumer demand for protein and a difficult supply situation for some animal proteins.

In July, Conagra Brands, Chicago, forecast inflation on its cost of goods sold in fiscal 2026 would remain elevated, perhaps reaching as high as 7%. The guidance anticipated core inflation of approximately 4% while tariffs on imported tin plate steel, imports from China and on imports from other countries would contribute another three percentage points.

“Managing this inflation will be a critical focus this year,” said David S. Marberger, chief financial officer, in comments released July 10 when the company reported earnings for fiscal 2025. “We expect core productivity to accelerate in fiscal ‘26 to approximately 4% of cost of goods sold, largely offsetting core inflation. Additionally, we have established a cross-functional task force to mitigate our tariff exposure through various cost reduction levers.”

Commodities seen principally responsible for the core inflation included beef, chicken, pork, turkey and eggs, which the company said rose double digits during the 2025 fiscal year.

In August, Hormel Foods, Austin, Minn., said an unexpected rise in the costs of pork, beef and nuts undermined the company’s performance during its third quarter. While Hormel experienced positive momentum in sales and organic volumes, the costs of such key inputs pummeled the company’s bottom line.

“… We anticipated upward pressure on input costs driven by (the) pork, beef and nut markets,” said Jacinth Smiley, CFO, during an Aug. 28 conference call to discuss third-quarter results. “However, during the third quarter, markets worsened significantly beyond our projections.”

Specific costs highlighted by Smiley included pork bellies, which were up 30% year over year, the pork cutout, which was up 10%, and beef prices, which had reached near all-time highs during year.

“Collectively, we experienced approximately 400 basis points of raw material cost inflation in the third quarter alone, representing a notable increase relative to last year,” Smiley said.

Hunger for protein

Demand for protein has remained a driving factor for the rising costs. Protein remains the most sought after nutrient in American consumers’ diets, according to surveys from the International Food Information Council (IFIC).

The data come from the 2025 Food & Health Survey, an annual survey of 3,000 consumers ages 18 to 80, and a July spotlight survey on consumer attitudes, beliefs and knowledge surrounding protein.

“For many years of the Food & Health Survey, we have asked consumers to tell us what food attributes they try to consume or avoid,” said Monica Amburn, senior director of food and nutrition at IFIC, in a July webinar. “We added protein to the list of options in 2021, and since then, for the fifth straight year in a row, protein is the top nutrient that most Americans say they are trying to consume … this is definitely significant, and people are highly aware of protein.”

In 2025, more than one in three consumers said they have upped their protein intake in the last year, and high-protein diets have remained the most cited eating pattern among Americans for the third year in a row. The Council also found that, for the first time, consumers are using “good source of protein claims” as the primary measure to define what constitutes a healthy food.

Approximately 80% of consumers report prioritizing protein intake during one meal a day, with the majority prioritizing protein during the dinner occasion. Preferred sources of protein include meat and poultry (65%), eggs (62%), fish and seafood (48%), dairy (41%), and beans, peas and lentils (40%). Taste is the primary factor for consumers when choosing a protein source, according to the report, followed by price, healthfulness and convenience.

In examining the most common perceived benefits associated with protein most consumers link protein with muscle health and strength. Other common associated benefits range from energy and lessened fatigue to improved overall well-being, healthy aging and bone health.

“This protein boom is being driven by media attention and increased consumer interest in topics such as GLP-1 medications and weight management, fitness, energy and healthy aging,” IFIC said.

Market outlook

Ongoing consumer demand for protein was reflected in the annual Power of Meat report, which was published in March and showed retail meat sales in the United States reached a record high of $104.6 billion in 2024, up 5% over 2023. Retail meat volume also rose 2.3% last year to 22.8 billion lbs when compared with 2023. It remains to be seen if the strong demand for meat at retail in 2024 carries over to 2025.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said its meat price index reached an all-time high in July, averaging 127.3 points, up 1.2% from June and up 6% from July 2024, due primarily to global beef prices, which also were at record highs.

Factors driving the high price of beef included the rebuilding of the US cattle herd, which has been at the bottom of the cycle for the past few years; tariffs on Brazil, a key exporter of lean beef to the United States; and a ban on live cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the spread of the animal disease New World screwworm.

The pork market also experienced supply challenges. In September, the US Department of Agriculture lowered second-half 2025 pork production by 180 million lbs due to lower-than-expected availability of slaughter-ready hogs. High feed costs were identified as a supply challenge and high beef prices, which have lifted wholesale pork prices, were identified as impacting the market.

The USDA said large feed grain crops would lead to lower feed costs in 2026 and contribute to an improvement in the supply of market-ready hogs.

The USDA increased projected broiler production for 2025 and 2026 on strong hatchery data and lower projected feed costs. The Department also adjusted wholesale broiler price projections down in 2025 and 2026 on recent price trends and increased production expectations. The agency, however, identified highly pathogenic avian influenza as an uncertainty that could affect the supply situation.",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2022/01/13/case-ready-meats.jpg?height=635&t=1716302092&width=1200,N,,2026-01-02 13:01:07.054406

Today we are looking at CooperCompanies COO and the best and worst performers in the medical devices & supplies - diversified industry.

The medical devices industry operates a business model that balances steady demand with significant investments in innovation and regulatory compliance. The industry benefits from recurring revenue streams tied to consumables, maintenance services, and incremental upgrades to the latest technologies. However, the capital-intensive nature of product development, coupled with lengthy regulatory pathways and the need for clinical validation, can weigh on profitability and timelines. In addition, there are constant pricing pressures from healthcare systems and insurers maximizing cost efficiency. Over the next several years, one tailwind is demographic–aging populations means rising chronic disease rates that drive greater demand for medical interventions and monitoring solutions. Advances in digital health, such as remote patient monitoring and smart devices, are also expected to unlock new demand by shortening upgrade cycles. On the other hand, the industry faces headwinds from pricing and reimbursement pressures as healthcare providers increasingly adopt value-based care models. Additionally, the integration of cybersecurity for connected devices adds further risk and complexity for device manufacturers.

The 6 medical devices & supplies - diversified stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.6% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.

In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.

CooperCompanies COO

With a history dating back to 1958 and a portfolio spanning two distinct healthcare segments, Cooper Companies COO develops and manufactures medical devices focused on vision care through contact lenses and women's health including fertility products and services.

CooperCompanies reported revenues of $1.07 billion, up 4.6% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, and overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ full-year EPS guidance estimates and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS guidance for next quarter estimates.

""We closed fiscal 2025 ahead of consensus revenue, earnings, and free cash flow expectations, and we enter 2026 with clear priorities to drive long-term shareholder value: accelerating top-line growth, improving profitability, accelerating cash generation, and continuing share repurchases,"" said Al White, CooperCompanies' President and CEO.

CooperCompanies delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 6.4% since reporting and currently trades at $81.96.

Best Q3: Neogen NEOG

Founded in 1981 and operating at the intersection of food safety and animal health, Neogen NEOG develops and manufactures diagnostic tests and related products to detect dangerous substances in food and pharmaceuticals for animal health.

Neogen reported revenues of $209.2 million, down 3.6% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 2.6%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ revenue estimates and full-year revenue guidance slightly topping analysts’ expectations.

Neogen achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 19.8% since reporting. It currently trades at $6.90.

Weakest Q3: Baxter BAX

With a history dating back to 1931 and products used in over 100 countries, Baxter International BAX provides essential healthcare products including dialysis therapies, IV solutions, infusion systems, surgical products, and patient monitoring technologies to hospitals and clinics worldwide.

Baxter reported revenues of $2.84 billion, up 5% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 1.4%. It was a softer quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ full-year EPS guidance estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations significantly.

Baxter delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 14.8% since the results and currently trades at $19.11.

Boston Scientific BSX

Founded in 1979 with a mission to advance less-invasive medicine, Boston Scientific BSX develops and manufactures medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures across cardiovascular, urological, neurological, and gastrointestinal specialties.

Boston Scientific reported revenues of $5.07 billion, up 20.3% year on year. This print topped analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. It was a very strong quarter as it also recorded an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter topping analysts’ expectations.

Boston Scientific delivered the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is down 4.3% since reporting and currently trades at $95.60.

Aviation analytics firm Cirium has published its annual On-Time Performance Review, the industry benchmark for measuring airline and airport schedule reliability.

Cirium’s On-Time Performance Review combines flight data from over 600 real-time and historical sources, reflecting operational performance across airlines and markets. The methodology counts arrivals within 14 minutes and 59 seconds of schedule as on time, following industry standards.

Reliable on-time performance is critical for passenger satisfaction. It also impacts airlines’ connections, aircraft utilisation, and crew scheduling. When flights fail to arrive as scheduled, delays can cascade across the network, disrupting operations. Keeping flights on time is challenging in increasingly congested skies, where technical failures and weather can significantly disturb the day’s schedule.

As Jeremy Bowen, Cirium CEO, said of this past year’s review: “Maintaining consistent on-time performance requires sophisticated network planning, operational coordination, and the ability to recover quickly when irregularities occur. These results reflect the operational discipline that defines aviation’s top performers.”

Cirium’s global on-time airline winners for 2025

After analysing hundreds of thousands of flights worldwide, Aeromexico emerged as the global leader with a 90.02% on-time performance (OTP), narrowly outpacing Saudia and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), which ranked second and third, respectively. It is the Mexican flag carrier’s second consecutive year atop the global rankings.

Top Global Airline Performers (2025):

1 — Aeromexico: 90.02% OTP

2 — Saudia: 86.53% OTP

3 — SAS (Scandinavian Airlines): 86.09% OTP

Note: OTP Percentages reflect flights arriving within 14 minutes 59 seconds of the scheduled time.

2025 most on-time regional airline winners

Cirium’s report also highlights regional leaders — carriers that excel within their operational networks:

North America: Delta Air Lines secured its fifth straight win with 80.90% OTP.

Europe: Iberia Express continued its regional dominance with an 88.94% OTP for the third consecutive year.

Asia-Pacific: Philippine Airlines claimed the regional title for the first time, achieving an 83.12% OTP.

Latin America: Copa Airlines stood out with an exceptional 90.75% OTP, its 11th win in this category—the most wins by any Latin American carrier since Cirium launched the OTP rankings in 2009.

Middle East & Africa: Safair led with a stellar 91.06% OTP.

Cirium Platinum Award winner and most improved airline

In addition to the rankings, Cirium presented two special awards to airlines, recognising their operational excellence.

Qatar Airways was honoured with a Platinum Award for its operational consistency, achieving an OTP of 84.42% on over 198,303 flights across six continents.

Virgin Atlantic earned Cirium’s inaugural “Most Improved” award after lifting its OTP from 74.02% in 2024 to 83.45% in 2025, a 9.44-point improvement year-over-year.

Most on-time airports of 2025

Cirium also recognised airports that delivered the most punctual operations across different categories:

Large Airport Category: Santiago Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport (SCL) — 87.04% of departures on time

Medium Airport Category: Tocumen International Airport (PTY) — 93.34% of departures on time

Small Airport Category: José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport (GYE) — 91.47% of departures on time

Cirium also awarded Istanbul Airport (IST) a Platinum Award in recognition of its “operational complexity, passenger impact during disruptions, and growth trajectory.”

What Cirium’s OTP rankings tell us about commercial aviation operations in 2026

Cirium’s rankings also reveal key operational trends driving the commercial aviation sector last year, which will also impact airline and airport on-time performance this year.

The narrow margins between the top international performers show that airlines are tightening their operations. This means that on-time flights are becoming more likely, barring situations outside of the airlines’ control. However, regional OTP can vary widely, with on-time arrival rates higher in some regions than in others, and achieving it at scale becomes more challenging.

For example, there is a significant 10.16 point difference between North America’s top carrier, Delta Air Lines, and the overall most on-time regional winner, Safair, and an 8.04 percentage point difference between Delta and Iberia Express in Europe. That Delta has won for the fifth consecutive the world’s year reflects strong operational consistency. Still, it must contend with a large and complex network, a central hub at the world’s busiest airport, and crowded national airspace, while providing both domestic and international services.

Cirium’s 2025 OTP Review demonstrates how airline network recovery, disruption management, and strategic hub performance can yield a competitive advantage, and hopefully, the average OTP percentage will rise industry-wide in 2026.

The Cleveland, Ohio-based Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH) is expected to announce its fiscal second-quarter earnings for 2026 in the near term, according to a recent financial report. Analysts expect the company to report a profit of $7.11 per share on a diluted basis, which would be an increase of 8.9% from the $6.53 per share reported in the same quarter last year.

Parker-Hannifin, a manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems valued at $110.9 billion by market cap, has consistently surpassed Wall Street's earnings per share estimates in its last four quarterly reports. For the full 2026 fiscal year, analysts expect the company to report EPS of $30.39, up 11.2% from $27.33 in fiscal 2025. Its EPS is forecast to rise further to $32.96 in fiscal 2027.

The company's stock has outperformed the broader market, with shares up 38% over the past 52 weeks. This compares to a 16.4% gain for the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and a 17.6% gain for the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) over the same period.

The reported outperformance is attributed to strong organic growth, driven by aerospace and defense strength and a return to positive territory in North America industrial operations. The aerospace segment has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Other key factors include commercial and aftermarket aerospace growth, improved productivity, cost controls, and the successful integration of Curtis Instruments.

On Nov. 6, Parker-Hannifin's shares closed up 7.8% following its first-quarter report. The company reported adjusted EPS of $7.22, exceeding expectations of $6.67. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, also above the $4.9 billion forecast.

J&J had been evaluating JNJ-95475939, an inhibitor of IL-4 and IL-31, against the IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent in a phase 2b study in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Despite only launching the study in February 2025, according to the federal trials database, the pharma decided it had seen enough.

“The results of a planned interim analysis met prespecified criteria for early termination of the study, as they did not meet the high-bar efficacy we established for advancing our clinical development programs for atopic dermatitis,” J&J explained in a Dec. 26 statement.

The subcutaneously administered therapy was well tolerated in the study, said the company, which stressed that the pharma remains “deeply committed to progressing our rich pipeline of clinical-stage and pre-clinical drug candidates for atopic dermatitis.”

The drug was a relatively new addition to J&J’s pipeline, after the company purchased it from Swiss biotech Numab Therapeutics for $1.25 billion in cash in mid-2024. At the time, Numab investor Novo Holdings pointed to “exciting early data in patients” as being behind J&J’s decision to acquire the drug.

While the end of JNJ-95475939 means that 10-figure price tag now looks like a bad call, J&J still has a number of other inflammation assets in development, including icotrokinra. The pharma is currently awaiting regulatory decisions on the Protagonist Therapeutics-partnered once-daily oral peptide after the drug bested Bristol Myers Squibb’s Sotyktu across a pair of phase 3 studies for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Meanwhile, acasunlimab, the PD-L1x4-1BB bispecific antibody Genmab junked over the holidays, is no stranger to rejection. At one point, the Danish biopharma had been collaborating on acasunlimab with BioNTech, evaluating the candidate in three clinical trials, including a phase 2 study as both a monotherapy and in combination with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

But, back in August 2024, BioNTech announced that despite acasunilimab’s “encouraging” clinical profile, it had decided not to go any further with the development of the candidate “for reasons relating to portfolio strategy.”

Genmab took acasunilimab into phase 3 trials by itself, but it sounds like the biopharma has now come to a similar conclusion as its former partner. In a Dec. 29 statement, Genmab said it was halting work on the therapy.

“This decision was made as part of Genmab’s strategic focus on the most value‑creating opportunities in its late‑stage portfolio and following a thorough assessment of the evolving competitive landscape,” the company said.

“Although the data have been encouraging, the compelling opportunities we see in our late‑stage pipeline led us to focus our investments where we believe we can deliver the greatest benefit for patients and shareholders,” Genmab CEO Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., explained in a statement.

The company’s strategy is now to “concentrate resources on programs with the highest potential impact.” They include the AbbVie-partnered blood cancer med Epkinly as well as petosemtamab, a phase 3-stage EGFR×LGR5 bispecific at the center of last year’s $8 billion buyout of Merus. There’s also Rina-S, a potential competitor to AbbVie’s Elahere that arrived from the acquisition of ProfoundBio.

Earlier in 2025, Genmab pruned its pipeline of two antibody-drug conjugates onboarded from the same ProfoundBio buyout.

William Blair analysts said acasunlimab had “rightfully hit the chopping block,” pointing to updated phase 2 data in November that showed median overall survival across the study was closer to 12.3 months than the 17.5 months suggested by initial results.

“We believe [dropping acasunilimab] is the right decision, given recent deterioration of the overall survival curve from the phase 2 trial with longer follow-up, and it does not detract from what we view as one of the best opportunities in large-cap biotech going into 2026, with key pivotal readouts for Epkinly, Rina-S and petosemtamab,” the analysts wrote in a Dec. 29 note.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1281723896.jpg?VersionId=AYiDXXI1prssk5jEWVXUpOWE5hmemQPM,N,,2026-01-02 11:03:35.100396

In other broader indexes, the Dow added 13.7 percent in 2025, while the Nasdaq gained 21.3 percent.

The lackluster performance was in large part due to disruptions from tariffs, as well as stalled turnaround efforts in several major stocks, including Nike, VF Corp. and Lululemon.

The S&P 500 leapt 17.3 percent in 2025, boosted by robust corporate earnings, enthusiasm for AI and optimism about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. The gains capped off an unprecedented three consecutive years of double-digit gains for the Index and came despite concerns about tariffs, geopolitical turmoil, nerves surrounding an AI bubble, and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

In other broader indexes, the Dow added 13.7 percent in 2025, while the Nasdaq gained 21.3 percent.

By comparison, of 82 stocks in the active lifestyle space tracked by SGB Media, only 20 – or 27 percent – outperformed the S&P 500’s 17.3 percent gain, while 48, or 59 percent, declined.

Active lifestyle stocks strongly outperformed broader indexes in 2020 and 2021, as the industry benefited from the early stages of the pandemic and heightened interest in outdoor and fitness activities. Sales slowed in the ensuing years as participation largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels, especially at the core level.

Spending on discretionary categories has also been affected in recent years by inflationary pressures, and this continued in 2025, with lower-income consumers particularly affected. Tariffs this year led to supply chain disruptions and higher operating expenses, also contributing to many vendors and retailers missing earnings and sales targets set at the start of the year.

Among stocks taking major hits were Deckers Brands, down 49 percent in 2025 amid concerns over decelerating growth at Hoka.

Nike’s shares fell 15.8 percent to $63.71 as turnaround efforts orchestrated by CEO Elliot Hill developed more slowly than investors hoped. Nike’s shares are down 64.4 percent from its all-time high of $179.10 reached in November 2021.

V.F. Corp., which continued to struggle to reawaken growth at Vans, also gave back another 15.8 percent in share value in 2025 and has collapsed 78 percent since reaching its all-time high in January 2020.

Shares of Newell Brands, parent of Coleman and Marmot, tumbled 62.7 percent, while Helen of Troy, parent of Hydro Flask and Osprey, lost 64.4 percent last year. Each recently slashed guidance due to tariff hits and slower spending. Shares of Columbia Sportswear, Crocs, and Under Armour all fell by more than 30 percent due to weak guidance.

Among the winners, shares of Amer Sports jumped 33.6 percent to $37.35 in 2025, as quarterly results steadily beat targets amid strong momentum at Arc’teryx and Salomon. Shares have nearly tripled since going at $13 a share in February 2024.

Topgolf Callaway jumped 48.5 percent after it recently reached an agreement to sell a 60 percent stake in its struggling Topgolf business to private equity firm Leonard Green, although it is still down about half its value over the past five years. Shares of Yeti, Canada Goose, Rocky Brands and Johnson Outdoors all showed some recovery.

Among retailers, Lululemon shares tumbled 44.9 percent in 2025. In mid-December, its CEO, Calvin McDonald, would depart at the close of the current fiscal year as the company reported its third straight quarter of declines in the Americas region.

Shares of Dick’s Sporting Goods declined 13.5 percent last year amid concerns over its acquisition of Foot Locker. Academy Sports, which fell about the same amount, saw top-line growth pressured by a pullback in spending by lower-income consumers.

Shares of Journey’s parent Genesco, Famous Footwear’s parent Caleres and Shoe Carnival were down over 40 percent amid sales shortfalls.

On the plus side, Walmart, TJX Cos. and Ross Stores were rewarded with higher valuations as shoppers favored retailers that emphasized low prices. Several department stores, including Macy’s, Dillard’s and Kohl’s, saw shares climb over 30 percent on improving results, while Urban Outfitters and Zumiez saw notable gains among specialty chains.

The active lifestyle industry saw no initial public offerings in 2025. Among firms exiting public trading through an acquisition were Big 5 Sporting Goods, Foot Locker, Hanesbrands, Nordstrom, Revelyst (formerly Vista Outdoor), and Skechers.

Trading volumes were thin at the end of 2025, but the new year could get off to an eventful start.
JOBS DATA COULD SEND RATE SIGNALS The employment data due on January 9 could provide a jolt either way.
Fed officials were divided over the path for monetary policy at the most recent meeting in December.
At the same time, investors are also wary that an overly weak report could signal more severe economic concern than markets currently anticipate.","NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The first full trading week of the new year could shake the U.S. stock market out of its winter holiday slumber as the monthly jobs data headlines a busy start to 2026 for investors.

Stocks slid in the final session of 2025, with the benchmark S&P 500 falling into a monthly loss for December. But the index still climbed more than 16% in 2025, its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, while the Cboe Volatility index was last just above its lows for the year.

Trading volumes were thin at the end of 2025, but the new year could get off to an eventful start. Aside from economic data, investors await a U.S. Supreme Court decision on President Donald Trump's tariffs along with his choice of a new Federal Reserve chair, and U.S. corporate earnings season is around the corner.

While the S&P 500 is near record highs, it is also around the same level it was in late October, noted Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.

""The market is looking for direction,"" Maley said. ""We break out of these ranges and that's going to give either people a lot of confidence or a lot of concern depending on which way it breaks.""

JOBS DATA COULD SEND RATE SIGNALS

The employment data due on January 9 could provide a jolt either way. Concerns over weakness in the labor market prompted the Fed to lower interest rates at each of its last three meetings of 2025, as the U.S. central bank juggles its goals of full employment and contained inflation.

Lower rates have supported equities, but the extent of further cuts in 2026 is unclear. Fed officials were divided over the path for monetary policy at the most recent meeting in December. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target.

With the benchmark rate at 3.5%-3.75%, Fed funds futures suggest little chance of a cut at the next meeting in late January, but nearly a 50% chance of a quarter-point reduction in March.

""The fact that there has been softening in the labor market has really given the Fed good cover to change their outlook about reducing rates,"" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago.

At the same time, investors are also wary that an overly weak report could signal more severe economic concern than markets currently anticipate.

Employment for December is expected to have climbed by 55,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. Payrolls rose by 64,000 in November, but the unemployment rate was 4.6%, a more than four-year high.

""If (employment) starts turning down in any kind of meaningful way, that's going to signal that the recession is a lot closer than people think,"" Maley said.

INFLATION, Q4 EARNINGS ALSO LOOM

Other data next week includes manufacturing and services sector activity, along with job openings and other labor market data. Economic releases are returning to more normal schedules following the 43-day government shutdown that delayed or canceled many key reports.

A closely watched report on inflation trends, the monthly U.S. consumer price index, is due out on January 13.

""Anything that has to do with underlying economic activity and inflation is really going to catch the market's attention,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, adding that a backdrop of modest economic growth and moderating inflation is ""a good environment for stocks and for risk assets in general.""

Investors will be gearing up for fourth-quarter earnings season, with results from JPMorgan on January 13, along with other major bank reports that week.

With stocks trading at historically lofty valuations, investors are banking on strong earnings growth. Overall S&P 500 company earnings are expected to have climbed 13% in 2025, with another 15.5% rise in 2026, according to LSEG IBES data.

""To make an investment case for the S&P 500 at current levels, one must believe in some combination of good/very good earnings growth and continued investor confidence in economic conditions and macro policy,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a research note.

Quick Summary – TLDR:

Morgan Stanley projects over 200,000 banking jobs will disappear in Europe by 2030 due to AI and automation.

The cuts target back-office and compliance roles as banks adopt AI for risk checks, customer service, and reporting.

Major banks like ABN AMRO and Société Générale are already implementing large-scale workforce reductions.

The shift also affects global peers, with firms like Goldman Sachs and UBS launching AI-driven restructuring.

What Happened?

A new analysis by Morgan Stanley, cited by the Financial Times, has revealed that Europe’s banks are poised to cut about 10% of their workforce over the next few years. The reduction translates to more than 200,000 jobs across 35 major banks, driven largely by AI adoption, digital transformation, and continued branch closures.

The job cuts are expected to hit back-office functions the hardest, including areas like risk management, compliance, transaction processing, and customer support, where AI can streamline operations at scale.

AI’s Growing Role in Reshaping Banking

For years, European banks have struggled with high cost-to-income ratios, often exceeding 60%, despite ongoing cost-cutting efforts. As digital-first competitors and instant payments reshape customer expectations, traditional banks are now accelerating the shift to AI-driven automation to improve efficiency.

Morgan Stanley’s report suggests banks could achieve 20% to 30% efficiency gains in departments with structured, repetitive, and data-heavy tasks. These include:

Know-your-customer (KYC) verification.

Loan processing.

Trade matching.

Anti-money laundering (AML) checks.

Internal reporting and reconciliations.

With AI models now mature enough to handle document summarization, code generation, and even credit decisioning, banks are deploying them in contact centers and compliance departments to speed up operations and reduce costs.

Early Movers: Who’s Cutting Jobs Already

Some banks are already executing major workforce cuts:

ABN AMRO has announced plans to reduce its workforce by 20% by 2028, attributing the decision to digitalization and simplification.

Société Générale CEO Slavomir Kucera said “no area is off-limits” in its restructuring strategy.

UBS has created an AI avatar of analysts to deliver personalized video insights to clients, signaling a shift in how banks use talent and technology.

In the U.S., Goldman Sachs launched the “OneGS 3.0” initiative to combine hiring freezes with automation of client onboarding and regulatory work.

These actions reflect the broader trend of AI reducing the need for traditional human labor in banking operations.

The Human Cost and Regulatory Concerns

While AI promises faster decisions and better customer experiences, the human impact is significant. Entire departments, particularly central services and middle-office roles, face downsizing. Although front-line roles in complex corporate lending and wealth management may be safer for now, even these are being reevaluated as technology evolves.

There are also concerns about regulatory oversight. The EU’s AI Act classifies many banking applications as high-risk, requiring rigorous human oversight. The European Banking Authority and ECB are pressing institutions to monitor model risk, fairness, and data quality, increasing the cost and complexity of implementation.

To avoid reputational damage from AI errors such as mispriced loans or hallucinated chat responses, banks are establishing “human-in-the-loop” safeguards, while ramping up model validation and governance efforts.

Gradual Rollout Due to Labor Dynamics

The projected job cuts will not happen overnight. Labor laws, unions, and national regulations in Europe typically require lengthy consultations and severance agreements. For instance, banks in Spain and Italy have historically leaned on early retirement and voluntary exits during restructuring.

Therefore, the estimated 200,000 job reduction is expected to occur in phases through 2030 rather than in one sweep.

Platts first proposed these changes in a subscriber note published on Oct. 14, available here (opens in a new tab).

Following market feedback, Platts notified its decision to implement the proposed changes in a subscriber note on Nov. 14 available here (opens in a new tab).

Platts had clarified in the same subscriber note that its existing Atlantic iron ore blast furnace pellet premium assessment (IOBFP00) will reflect a premium over 61% Fe iron ore fines from January 2026, reflecting updated specifications for Platts IODEX CFR China benchmark.

New 65% basis Atlantic BF pellet premium assessment

Platts has launched a new Atlantic iron ore blast furnace pellet premium to reflect the premium over the Platts iron ore fines 65% Fe CFR China assessment.

This follows market feedback indicating higher liquidity and usage of Atlantic pellet premium contract settlements over 65% Fe fines.

The new assessment has the following specifications:

The assessment will reflect a 4:30 pm London timestamp on the first business day of the month and follow the London holiday calendar. The assessment will be published in SBB Steel Markets Daily, and on fixed pages STL1160, PMA1160.

The assessment will consider market information reported to Platts and published throughout the preceding month, including firm bids and offers, transactions and indications, as well as any other data deemed relevant to the assessment process.

Existing Atlantic BF pellet premium to continue reflecting differential over IODEX

As previously communicated, Platts will continue to assess its existing Atlantic Iron Ore Blast Furnace Pellet Contract Price Premium over the quality-adjusted medium grade iron ore fines benchmark (IOBFP00), which will be published in parallel to the new 65% basis Atlantic BF pellet premium assessment, effective Jan. 2, 2026.

In addition, Platts clarified the basis of this assessment (IOBFP00) will continue to reflect the additional charge over the quality-adjusted iron ore fines on a 62% Fe basis, until contractual premiums are observed to have migrated to settling against the updated IODEX reflecting 61% Fe iron ore fines.

Celltrion shares rallied Friday after the South Korean biosimilar maker secured a new U.S. contract and forecast a quarterly earnings beat.

The stock jumped as much as 13% to 204,500 won in afternoon trading in Seoul, on track for its steepest gain in two years and outperformed the Kospi, which rose about 2%.

Earlier in the day, Celltrion said it had secured a $473 million contract manufacturing organization deal from Eli Lilly. The four-year CMO contract came as the South Korean company completed its acquisition of a U.S. facility from the American pharmaceutical firm.

Celltrion said in September that it purchased an Eli Lilly biologics facility in Branchburg, N.J., for 460 billion won, equivalent to $318.8 million, as part of a roughly $1 billion investment plan to acquire and expand the site to reduce U.S. tariff risks.

In a preliminary earnings forecast issued earlier this week, Celltrion said it expects operating profit to more than double from a year earlier to a quarterly record of 472 billion won for the October-December period. That estimate would exceed the FactSet-compiled consensus forecast of 408 billion won.

The company also said it expects revenue to rise 21% from a year earlier to a record 1.284 trillion won in the fourth quarter, lifting annual revenue above 4 trillion won.

Nomura analyst Cindy Park said Friday that Celltrion's 2026 revenue target of 5.3 trillion won supports a positive outlook, citing the company's plan to scale up its contract development and manufacturing organization business using the U.S. plant acquired from Eli Lilly.

In 2025, Celltrion launched five new biosimilars that Nomura estimates will begin contributing to revenue from 2026. The company currently has 11 biosimilars in its portfolio and is actively expanding product formulations, Park noted.

Analysts H.J. Wi and Dayong Lee of Korea Investment & Securities said Friday that they expect Celltrion's revenue and operating profit to grow 27% and 44%, respectively, in 2026, with the U.S. CMO business likely to accelerate revenue growth and improve operating margins. They raised their target price to 240,000 won from 220,000 won and maintained a buy rating.

According to the lawsuit, the family of four flew from Virginia to Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on March 21 before boarding a KLM flight to Amsterdam.
Afterward, they learned that KLM flight attendants had filed a complaint internally about the infestation.
A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines shared a comment with CBS News Atlanta.
“As this pending litigation eventually states, the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines,” the statement reads.","A Virginia family has filed a lawsuit against Delta Air Lines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, claiming they were bitten by bed bugs during a flight.

The complaint, filed on December 18 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, alleges that the Albuquerque family’s vacation from Roanoke to Belgrade, Serbia, was ruined when the infestation forced them to discard their clothes and personal belongings.

According to the lawsuit, the family of four flew from Virginia to Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on March 21 before boarding a KLM flight to Amsterdam.

Although KLM operated the flight, the tickets were purchased through Delta’s SkyMiles program.

While seated in business class, just behind first class, Lisandra Garcia reportedly began feeling bugs crawling on her and noticed bites, reports say

When the couple alerted flight attendants, the lawsuit claims they were told to “keep their voices down to avoid a ‘panic’ on the airplane.”

The complaint adds that, before landing in Amsterdam, flight attendants again urged Dr. Albuquerque and Garcia not to report the infestation, warning that doing so could cause them to miss their connecting flight to Serbia.

Upon disembarking, the family was allegedly handed plastic bags for their personal items.

Reports say the lawsuit includes several photos showing bugs on Garcia’s sweater and what appears to be insects on a napkin branded with the airline’s name.

The family says they began experiencing bites during the flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam. Afterward, they learned that KLM flight attendants had filed a complaint internally about the infestation.

Once they reached their final destination, the lawsuit claims, all four family members suffered welts, rashes, and lesions.

The Albuquerques are seeking $200,000 (USD) in damages, along with any other relief the court deems appropriate, to cover their injuries, medical expenses, and related losses.

A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines shared a comment with CBS News Atlanta.

“As this pending litigation eventually states, the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines,” the statement reads. “Delta will review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.”

KLM has yet to comment publicly on the lawsuit.",https://www.paxnews.com/storage/app/uploads/public/695/7ba/303/6957ba303569e337327695.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 10:02:07.708947

The court in Beijing backed the validity of Novo Nordisk's compound patent for semaglutide, which is the main ingredient in the company's obesity therapy Wegovy and diabetes treatments Ozempic and Rybelsus, used by tens of millions of people worldwide.
""This outcome is very positive for semaglutide and demonstrates firm government support for protecting medical innovation,"" said Doustdar.
Meanwhile, ex-US sales of semaglutide products could become increasingly important as the prices of GLP-1 drugs come under pressure in the US.
Novo Nordisk has previously said that the compound patent expiry of the semaglutide molecule in certain countries is expected to have an estimated negative low-single-digit impact on global sales growth in 2026, and it suggested that the Chinese ruling does not alter that prediction.","Novo Nordisk has been handed a crucial legal win by China's Supreme Court, which has upheld the company's patent protection on GLP-1 agonist semaglutide used for diabetes and weight loss.

The court in Beijing backed the validity of Novo Nordisk's compound patent for semaglutide, which is the main ingredient in the company's obesity therapy Wegovy and diabetes treatments Ozempic and Rybelsus, used by tens of millions of people worldwide.

The importance of the ruling can't be overstated, given that China is the second-largest pharma market worldwide, after the US, and semaglutide products collectively contributed almost three-quarters of the Danish group's sales in the first nine months of 2025.

It's a fillip for new Novo Nordisk chief executive Mike Doustdar, who took the helm last year with a clear remit to defend the GLP-1-based weight loss and diabetes business from rivals like Eli Lilly, as well as knock-off versions of semaglutide that sidestep the company's intellectual property (IP).

""This outcome is very positive for semaglutide and demonstrates firm government support for protecting medical innovation,"" said Doustdar.

""This decision also strengthens confidence for foreign companies' sustainable development in China and will motivate further development and introduction of innovative medicines for the benefit of patients,"" he added.

The ruling is particularly important this year, as Novo Nordisk starts extending its semaglutide franchise with the imminent launch of anew oral formulation, the Wegovy pill, that is expected to drive even further usage of GLP-1 drugs among people who – in most cases – pay for the drug out of their own pockets.

Oral Wegovy was approved in the US at the end of 2025 and is also filed in Europe, with a decision there due in the latter half of this year. It is a key product for Doustdar as he tries to turn around a business that was briefly the biggest company in Europe in 2024, fuelled by rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs, before a rapid fall in its value over the course of 2025.

Meanwhile, ex-US sales of semaglutide products could become increasingly important as the prices of GLP-1 drugs come under pressure in the US.

Besides Intra-Cellular, there was plenty of other exciting activity, especially later in the year, which witnessed two big-ticket bidding wars.

One, between Novo Nordisk and Pfizer over obesity star Metsera, landed itself in this list by driving Pfizer to double its initial offer. The ordeal was also among the most dramatic public spats between two pharma powerhouses. The other bidding war was between Alkermes and Lundbeck over Avadel.

While it got messy and hectic times, the dealmaking activity last year suggests that Big Pharmas have the money to fund hefty purchases—and are willing to spend it. Indeed, as of October 2025, the industry had hit an aggregate takeover value of $70 billion, according to a report from Oppenheimer at the time. This sum already eclipsed the total M&A spend in 2024, 2022 and 2021.

Here, BioSpace looks back at the biggest acquisition deals of 2025.

J&J Strikes Year’s Largest Deal in January

Target: Intra-Cellular Therapies

Acquisition date: January 13

Final bid: $14.6 billion

2025 got off to an explosive start when J&J announced in January the acquisition of neurology specialist Intra-Cellular Therapies for an eye-watering $14.6 billion.

The deal, which formally closed in April, gave the healthcare giant Caplyta, a daily antipsychotic pill approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and depressive episodes in patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. In November, the FDA approved an expansion for Caplyta as an adjunctive therapy with antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Aside from Caplyta, J&J also got Intra-Cellular’s clinical pipeline, including the mid-stage ITI-1284, a deuterated form of Caplyta being tested for generalized anxiety disorder, as well as Alzheimer’s disease agitation and psychosis.

These assets will complement J&J’s own neuro portfolio, led by the antidepressant nasal spray Spravato and the antipsychotic franchise Invega. Reacting to J&J’s takeover of Intra-Cellular, Stifel analysts wrote in a Jan. 15 note that the pharma’s $14.6-billion vote of confidence “is a much-needed win for the neuroscience space,” breathing life into a field that has notoriously been difficult to succeed in.

The deal also set the tone for women-led biotechs securing exits in the double-digit billions, with CEO Sharon Mates, who co-founded Intra-Cellular back in 2002 and served as its chair, president and CEO.

Months of Negotiations Land RNA Pipeline for Novartis

Target: Avidity Biosciences

Acquisition date: October 25

Final bid: $12 billion

Joining J&J in giving neuro a nudge is Novartis, which in October put $12 billion on the line to swallow Avidity Biosciences and its portfolio of investigational RNA therapies, landing the second spot on this list.

Novartis’ proposal wasn’t always that hefty, however. Regulatory documents released a month later showed that the pharma’s initial offer was $7.4 billion—way too low for the biotech’s CEO Sarah Boyce. Months of negotiation followed, with Novartis upping its bid to $8.5 billion then $10 billion and, lastly, to the final price of $12 billion.

Avidity’s pipeline is led by three antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates (AOCs), all of which are in registrational development. These include del-zota for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), del-desiran for myotonic dystrophy type 1 and del-brax for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. AOCs consist of a monoclonal antibody to target a specific disease-related protein attached to a short string of nucleotides that produces therapeutic effects.

Leveraging this mechanism, del-zota elicited a 25% increase in dystrophin expression in DMD patients, according to a Phase I/II readout in August last year. A week before being acquired by Novartis, Avidity announced that it expects to submit a biologics license application (BLA) for del-zota in the first quarter of 2026.

Similarly, del-desiran and del-brax are moving steadily toward registration. The former is in Phase III development with first enrollment in July, while the company opened an accelerated pathway for the latter in June.

Aside from del-zota, del-desiran and del-brax, Novartis also picked up other preclinical DMD and rare neuromuscular programs from the acquisition. Avidity also has two early precision cardiology programs that will spin out into a new public company.

Merck Nabs Approved COPD Drug With $5B Potential

Target: Verona Pharma

Acquisition date: July 9

Final bid: $10 billion

Also breaking the 11-figure mark this year is Verona Pharma, which in July commanded a $10 billion buyout offer from Merck.

The centerpiece of the acquisition was Ohtuvayre, which won the FDA’s approval in June 2024 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), opening up a new mechanism of action for the indication for the first time in more than two decades. In the first quarter of this year, before Merck’s takeover, Verona reported around 25,000 prescriptions for Ohtuvayre, bringing in $71.3 million in sales. Jefferies has previously forecasted peak annual sales for Ohtuvayre between $3 billion and $5 billion.

Regulatory documents released in August 2025 revealed that Merck was the sole bidder for Verona—despite the biotech starting its search for suitors in 2023. Still, during the duration of its courtship with Merck, which began in February, a handful of other unidentified companies approached Verona to explore the possibility of Ohtuvayre-centered agreements, though none of these worked out.

The Merck transaction officially closed in October 2025.

At the time the acquisition was announced, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said that Merck’s $10-billion bet is part of its effort to “to replace commercial revenues now,” before mega-blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda loses patent protections in 2028. Indeed, the pharma in recent years has gone on a shopping spree, buying Prometheus Biosciences for $10.8 billion in April 2023.

Pfizer Battles Novo for the Hottest Obesity Biotech

Target: Metsera

Acquisition date: November 7

Final bid: $10 billion

In November, Pfizer acquired one of the brightest rising stars in the weight-loss game with a $10 billion play for Metsera. The takeover represented Pfizer’s comeback in the obesity arena after scrapping a string of disappointing assets over the years, and the pharma had to work extra hard for its prize.

Pfizer’s first bid for Metsera was a relatively modest $4.9 billion, which the biotech accepted in September. A month later, however, Novo Nordisk filed an unsolicited rival bid of $8.5 billion to snatch Metsera out from under Pfizer. Metsera dubbed the proposal “superior” to Pfizer’s offer and set off a clock for negotiations.

Pfizer bristled at these developments and called Novo’s rival proposal “reckless and unprecedented.” Later, the pharma also claimed that Metsera’s controlling stockholders—including the investors ARCH Venture Fund and Validae Health—“conspired” with Metsera and Novo to promote “anti-competitive activities.”

Pfizer sued both Novo and Metsera to stop what it called the “tortious interference” from Novo “to suppress competition.” At one point, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, joined the fray and wrote to both Novo and Metsera, warning them that the proposed deal structure may be in violation of U.S. merger guidelines.

All the while, Novo stood by its decision to try to steal Metsera away—no matter how unpopular it was—upping the bid to $10 billion. Novo’s new CEO, Maziar Mike Doustdar, even goaded Pfizer from the White House. “Our message to Pfizer is that if they would like to buy the company, then put your hand in the pocket and bid higher,” Doustdar said during an event for a drug pricing deal with the government for its GLP-1 drugs.

Ultimately, that’s what Pfizer did. The pharma eventually matched Novo’s offer, finally convincing its rival to back down and Metsera to accept the proposal.

Sanofi Takes Over Rising Cancer Star

Target: Blueprint Medicines

Acquisition date: June 2

Final bid: $9.5 billion

Closing out this list is the mid-year merger between Sanofi and rare disease specialist Blueprint Medicines, led by CEO Kate Haviland, the third female leader on this list.

The companies in June agreed to a $9.5 billion acquisition deal, giving Sanofi the FDA-approved systemic mastocytosis drug Ayvakit and a pipeline of investigational immunology and cancer therapies. In 2024, Ayvakit made $479 million. Because of the Sanofi takeover, Blueprint hasn’t reported sales figures for Ayvakit for the latter half of the year, but the pharma in its Q3 business report credited the drug as being partly responsible for a 57.1% increase in sales.

Speaking to analysts in a call after the acquisition, Sanofi’s head of specialty care Brian Foard said that Ayvakit’s launch was “just getting started” and that the pharma sees a lot of long-term potential for the drug. Beyond Ayvakit, Sanofi also got elenestinib, a KIT blocker for systemic mastocytosis.

Blueprint’s pipeline also includes BLU-808, in early-stage development for chronic urticaria, allergic rhinoconjunctivities, allergic asthma and mast cell activation syndrome. Blueprint is also bringing to the Sanofi fold several discovery-phase assets for various cancers, including breast cancer and other solid tumors.

All told, Leerink analysts in a June 2 note estimated that Blueprint’s revenues could hit $2.1 billion by 2030—though to hit this bar, Sanofi “will need to deliver on its plans to find and treat more patients.” And, for the acquisition to pay off, “it is critical, in our view, that BPMC’s pipeline delivers blockbuster revenue over the long term,” Leerink added.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/0022ca7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1241x698+0+74/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2Fb5%2F980e9fe04faca1b93c48aec58031%2Fistock-1430602277.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 07:59:29.887598

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""Further signs of growth emanated from the UK manufacturing sector before the turn of the year.
Output rose for the third successive month and new order intakes improved, albeit slightly, for the first time since September 2024.""
The UK manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers at around 650 manufacturers, with data collected between December 4 and 18.","(Alliance News) - UK manufacturing showed further signs of stabilisation at the end of 2025, with output and new orders edging higher and the sector recording its strongest reading in more than a year, according to survey data published by S&P Global on Thursday.

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 50.6 points in December from 50.2 in November, marking a 15-month high and remaining above the 50.0-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction.

The final reading was, however, below the earlier flash estimate of 51.2 points published in mid-December.

Manufacturing output increased for a third consecutive month, supported in part by stock building and efforts to clear backlogs of work. New orders rose for the first time since September 2024, with domestic demand cited as the main driver, while the decline in export orders eased to one of the weakest rates seen in nearly four years.

Growth was uneven across the sector. Output rose across consumer, intermediate and investment goods producers, the first time this has occurred since August 2024, but the expansion was concentrated among large manufacturers. Small and medium-sized firms continued to report declines in both output and new orders.

Employment remained in contraction territory, with job losses recorded for a 14th straight month, although the pace of decline eased to its weakest level during that period.

Price pressures picked up in December. Input cost inflation accelerated as manufacturers reported higher prices for a range of materials, including energy, metals, and electronics, and as suppliers passed on higher payroll-related costs. Output prices also rose after falling in November.

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""Further signs of growth emanated from the UK manufacturing sector before the turn of the year. Output rose for the third successive month and new order intakes improved, albeit slightly, for the first time since September 2024.""

He added: ""UK manufacturers benefited from several reduced headwinds towards the end of the year, as the negative impacts of the uncertainty surrounding the autumn budget, tariffs and the JLR cyber-attack all moderated.

""The start of 2026 will show if growth can be sustained after these temporary boosts subside.""

The UK manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers at around 650 manufacturers, with data collected between December 4 and 18.

The UK's services and composite PMIs will be published on Tuesday.

Eine Analyse der US-Bank Morgan Stanley prognostiziert, dass europäische Geldhäuser in den kommenden fünf Jahren mehr als 210.000 Stellen streichen werden. Die Untersuchung umfasst 35 Banken mit insgesamt 2,12 Millionen Beschäftigten. Neben AI-Integration treibt auch die fortschreitende Digitalisierung des Bankgeschäfts und die Schließung von Filialen den Abbau voran. Die Institute erhoffen sich dadurch Effizienzsteigerungen von bis zu 30 Prozent.

Am stärksten trifft es zentrale Dienstleistungsbereiche: Back-Office und Middle-Office-Funktionen stehen ebenso auf der Abschussliste wie Positionen im Risikomanagement und in der Compliance. Morgan Stanley sieht vor allem in Ländern mit ungünstigem Kosten-Ertrags-Verhältnis massive Einschnitte – Deutschland und Frankreich führen diese Liste an. Allerdings sind die versprochenen Effizienzgewinne bislang nicht sichtbar geworden. Die Banken stehen unter erheblichem Druck von Investoren, ihre Kostenstrukturen zu verbessern und ihre Eigenkapitalrenditen zu steigern, die dauerhaft hinter jenen amerikanischer Wettbewerber zurückbleiben.

Konkrete Beispiele: Von ABN Amro bis Société Générale

Mehrere Institute haben bereits konkrete Schritte angekündigt: Die niederländische ABN Amro plant, bis 2028 rund ein Fünftel ihrer Vollzeitstellen abzubauen. Bei Société Générale ließ CEO Slawomir Krupa im März verlauten, dass in seinem Feldzug gegen die hartnäckig hohe Kostenbasis nichts unantastbar sei. UBS treibt die AI-Integration besonders aggressiv voran und setzt die Technologie bereits ein, um Analysten in Avatare zu verwandeln – simulierte Banker, die als Videos an Kunden verschickt werden. Das Institut hat kürzlich 250 Top-Manager zu einem AI-Leadership-Summit nach Oxford geschickt.

Die Transformation läuft auf Hochtouren, weil frühere Kostensenkungsrunden ausgereizt sind und AI neue Möglichkeiten eröffnet. Besonders konsumentenorientierte Banken und Institute in Hochkostenländern müssen handeln. Die Verlagerung des Geschäfts ins Internet beschleunigt zusätzlich den Abbau klassischer Filialstrukturen und macht traditionelle Vertriebsmodelle obsolet.

Warnung vor übereiltem Tempo

Trotz des Enthusiasmus mehren sich kritische Stimmen: Führende Banker in Europa warnen davor, AI überstürzt zu integrieren. Conor Hillery, Co-Chef von JPMorgan Chase für Europa, Naher Osten und Afrika, betont die Gefahr, dass Mitarbeiter im Eifer das Verständnis für grundlegende Bankprozesse verlieren könnten. JPMorgan versuche, eine Balance zu finden zwischen AI-gestützter Beschleunigung von Basisfunktionen und der ordentlichen Ausbildung von Junior-Mitarbeitern in Kernkompetenzen wie der Erstellung von Cashflow-Modellen. Andernfalls drohe ein massives Problem für die Zukunft, so die einhellige Warnung aus der Branche.

Jason Napier, Chef der europäischen Bankenforschung bei UBS, sieht bereits heute Branchenveränderungen in Audit, Recht und Consulting – die Banken selbst würden aber noch keine verbesserte Effizienz liefern. Die mächtigen neuen Tools seien noch nicht vollständig implementiert. Wer noch Überzeugungsarbeit brauche, dass AI den Finanzsektor grundlegend verändern werde, solle mehr Zeit mit den bereits verfügbaren Werkzeugen verbringen. Gleichzeitig gibt es auch optimistische Stimmen: Der Bitkom sieht Potenzial für neue Jobprofile, die durch vermehrten AI-Einsatz entstehen könnten. Die Prognosen zum AI-bedingten Jobabbau sind zuletzt insgesamt moderater ausgefallen als in den dramatischsten frühen Szenarien – mittlerweile zeichnet sich klarer ab, wo AI tatsächlich menschliche Arbeit ersetzen kann und wo nicht.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/floriane-vita-FyD3OWBuXnY-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 05:58:57.990900

“Here’s this woman who’s supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice,” French Gates said.","Melinda French Gates is one of the wealthiest women in America but her path to a $17.4 billion fortune began with an unusual advice from hiring manager at IBM. A hiring manager at the US-based multinational technology company told her to turn down the job, and instead join Microsoft that was relatively new at that time. French Gates interned at IBM for two summers, and was on the verge of accepting a full-time position with the company.

The ‘Dumbfounding’ advice for Melinda French Gates

During the conversation, she told the hiring manager that she had interviewed with a tiny company in Seattle, according to Fortune. “My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny,” French Gates said during an interview. “And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me,” she added. The manager’s reason was clear: She reportedly said that a young recruit would have the better chance to move up quickly at Microsoft as it was growing rapidly. French Gates took the leap and moved to the West Coast in Seattle. “I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing. I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said. French Gates spent nine years at Microsoft and became the General Manager of Information Products. She was a critical architect of the company’s expansion, which is now a $3.6 trillion software titan.

Reflecting on her journey, French Gates now uses her story to encourage other women. “I remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. It’s not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this,” she said. “Here’s this woman who’s supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice,” French Gates said.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm. ""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm. ""

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. "" The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll

The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions. OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion. That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.

“With the Eli Lilly agreement, our US plant is expected to post record sales this year,” a Celltrion official said.","Celltrion said Friday it had completed the acquisition of Eli Lilly’s plant in Branchburg, New Jersey, closing the deal about five months after it was named the preferred bidder in late July 2025.

The New Jersey plant includes manufacturing facilities, a logistics warehouse, a technical support center and an operations center, spanning about 148,760 square meters. It has current production capacity of about 66,000 liters of drug substance.

The Korean biosimilar giant said it planned to begin expansion work immediately and invest an additional 700 billion won ($485 million) to double capacity to 132,000 liters.

The firm also plans to enter contract manufacturing arrangements valued at about 678.7 billion won, under which it will supply biopharmaceuticals to Eli Lilly through 2029. The contract period has been set at four years to allow for contingencies, Celltrion said.

The revenue from the contract manufacturing business alone is expected to allow for an early recovery of the investment costs related with acquiring the facility, excluding operating expenses, the company added.

“With the Eli Lilly agreement, our US plant is expected to post record sales this year,” a Celltrion official said. “We have begun the expansion process to strengthen production capacity, as we seek to make a leap forward as a global firm.”

For the Korean firm, buying an existing facility that meets current Good Manufacturing Practice standards allowed it to secure an overseas production base more quickly than building a new plant.

The acquisition is expected to reduce exposure to US tariff risks and ease geopolitical uncertainty by diversifying Celltrion’s global manufacturing base, the firm said.

The firm said the New Jersey plant will help improve profitability, efficiency and supply-chain stability by enabling direct manufacturing, lowering logistics costs through local sales and strengthening its presence in the world’s largest pharmaceutical market.

Morgan Stanley notes that many banks are already declaring a potential efficiency increase of up to 30% through the use of artificial intelligence and the further development of digital service channels.

Financial institutions are increasingly moving operations online, trying to reduce costs and increase productivity.

Such risks are reported by the Financial Times, citing analytical assessments by Morgan Stanley. According to the investment bank, by 2030 the European banking industry could reduce about 10% of its staff, recording savings from the use of AI and large-scale digitalization of business processes.

The greatest reduction is expected to affect the so-called “central services” - back and middle offices, as well as risk management and compliance departments. The findings are based on an analysis of data from 35 large banks, which together employ about 2.12 million people.

Thus, a 10% reduction in staff would mean the loss of about 212 thousand jobs. Morgan Stanley notes that many banks are already declaring a potential efficiency increase of up to 30% through the use of artificial intelligence and the further development of digital service channels.

European credit institutions are at the same time under increasing pressure from investors who demand new tools to reduce costs and increase return on capital. For many years, these indicators in European banks have been inferior to the results of their American competitors, which reinforces the need for more radical changes.

Some banks have already openly called AI a key catalyst for restructuring. In particular, in November, the Dutch ABN Amro announced plans to reduce about a fifth of its staff by 2028. And Société Générale CEO Sławomir Krupa warned back in March that “nothing is sacred” in the cost-cutting program.

Morgan Stanley analysts believe that it is artificial intelligence that gives banks a chance to significantly improve their cost-to-income ratio, a key performance indicator closely watched by investors. Previous waves of cost optimization have almost exhausted their potential, and without a technological breakthrough, further cost reductions are becoming increasingly difficult.

The forecast also emphasizes that the deepening of digitalization and the introduction of AI can significantly change the banking landscape of Europe in the coming years. The most tangible transformations are expected in retail banking and in countries such as France and Germany, where the cost-to-income ratio still remains relatively high.

The rapid development of artificial intelligence in general is increasing fears of mass layoffs in various sectors of the economy, as technology gradually approaches the level at which it can replace a significant part of human labor. The potential of AI to transform the banking sector is also recognized by UBS, which is already using this technology to create “virtual bankers” — analyst avatars that send personalized video messages to clients.

COMPAGNIE GÉNÉRALE DES ÉTABLISSEMENTS MICHELIN

Michelin annonce deux projets d’acquisition,

visant à renforcer son activité Polymer Composite Solutions

Michelin accélère sa croissance avec l’acquisition de Cooley Group et de Tex Tech Industries, deux leaders des marchés de tissus enduits et textiles techniques.

Hausse d’environ 20 % du chiffre d’affaires de l’activité Polymer Composite Solutions, qui deviendra prochainement un segment de reporting spécifique dans la communication financière du Groupe.

Opérations intégralement financées par la trésorerie disponible, solidité financière préservée; clôtures des transactions attendues au premier semestre 2026.

Dans le cadre de sa stratégie « Michelin in Motion 2030 », le Groupe capitalise sur son savoir-faire et son expertise pour se développer sur de nouveaux marchés à forte valeur ajoutée. Au cours des deux derniers mois, Michelin a conclu des accords en vue d’acquérir Cooley Group, spécialiste des tissus enduits industriels, et Tex Tech Industries, concepteur et fabricant de premier plan de textiles et tissus spécialisés. Ces deux entreprises présentent une forte complémentarité stratégique avec le Groupe, partageant un même engagement en faveur de l’innovation et de la qualité des produits, tout en opérant sur des géographies complémentaires.

Célébrant son 100e anniversaire en 2026 et ayant son siège à Rhode Island (États-Unis), Cooley est mondialement reconnue pour son expertise dans les tissus enduits polymères haute performance. L’entreprise est intégrée verticalement, avec des capacités en tissage, tricotage et extrusion de polymères. Cooley Group conçoit et fabrique des solutions polymères innovantes et durables pour un large panel d’applications, notamment les dispositifs médicaux, l’étanchéité, la rétention d’eau et de produits chimiques, ainsi que d’autres solutions critiques environnementales.

Fondée en 1904 dans le Maine (États-Unis), Tex Tech Industries est l'un des principaux concepteurs et fabricants de textiles, tissus et revêtements spécialisés destinés à un large éventail d'industries et d'applications de niche. La société a créé des solutions pour certaines des applications les plus exigeantes, notamment des systèmes de protection thermique pour les véhicules spatiaux, des matériaux résistant au feu pour le fuselage des avions, des textiles ignifuges pour les sièges d'avion et des tissus sur mesure pour les applications composites.

Michelin est déjà leader européen dans le domaine des tissus enduits avec des marques telles que Orca. Ces deux acquisitions accéléreraient fortement son expansion sur de nouveaux marchés et dans de nouvelles régions, et augmenteraient d'environ 20 % (~ 280 millions de dollars) le chiffre d'affaires de l’activité Polymer Composite Solutions de Michelin.

Les deux transactions devraient être finalisées au cours du premier semestre 2026, sous réserve des ajustements habituels et des autorisations de contrôle des fusions dans les juridictions concernées. Elles seraient entièrement financées par la trésorerie disponible, pour des montants non divulgués à ce stade.

Comme l’activité Polymer Composite Solutions atteint une taille significative au sein de Michelin, le Groupe prévoit de créer un segment de reporting dédié à partir de 2026.

In 2024, DrDoctor launched Smart Centre, an AI tool that predicts which patients are most likely to miss appointments and adjusts capacity accordingly.

The company manages more than 140 million appointments for 36 million patients through 70 NHS organisations, covering almost two thirds of the country.","Until recently, DrDoctor tried to tackle the epidemic of missed appointments through fixes such as reminder texts. But Whicher, 41, said the company reached a point where it “hit a barrier as to what we can achieve”. With AI, he said, it has now built tools that five years ago would have been “unimaginable”.

In 2024, DrDoctor launched Smart Centre, an AI tool that predicts which patients are most likely to miss appointments and adjusts capacity accordingly. Early results show that non-attendance rates have fallen by about 30 per cent at hospitals using Smart Centre, which would equate to a savings opportunity of £300 million every year for the NHS. One site treated 9,000 additional patients in three months, while another eliminated out-of-hours clinics.

The platform uses machine learning to score the likelihood of a patient attending their appointment, based on demographics, age, deprivation indices, past attendance records and the time and day of the appointment.

DrDoctor had access to four billion rows of data, including records of 55 million patients and 160 million appointments. A team of ten software engineers spent months cleaning and anonymising the data before training their model with it.

Development took roughly two years, funded largely by a £1 million award from the Department of Health and Social Care. DrDoctor pays back the investment via revenue sharing and offers the NHS a discount.

Once the system was live, the harder task of persuading hospitals to change how they operate began. As well as overhauling old systems, the company had to retrain staff and ensure patients were on board. Engineers were deployed to hospitals to work with admin teams to build out and test the model. Educating workers and patients “is more important than almost anything else”, Whicher said.

Alongside the predictor is an AI voice agent that handles routine queries, manages appointments and provides pre and post-appointment support. An early attempt at voice AI was shelved because it sounded, in Whicher’s words, “like a robot”. When the team revisited it six months ago, the technology had moved on so much that the second build took a quarter of the time and now features regionally accented voices.

“Patients get very frustrated by not being able to get through on the phone, and equally hospital administrators spend a lot of time on relatively routine tasks that actually can be done amazingly well by AI,” Whicher said.

• Our AI healthcare agents spot warning signs before it’s too late

By automating routine calls, staff are freed to support patients with more complicated needs, such as those facing language barriers.

DrDoctor now plans to expand the voice agent’s remit to include medical queries and recovery support, potentially reducing the need for follow-up hospital visits.

According to a Morgan Stanley analysis cited by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 jobs could be eliminated across European banks by 2030 as lenders increasingly rely on AI and continue to close physical branches. The figure represents close to 10% of the combined workforce at 35 of the region’s largest banks, underlining the scale of the transformation now underway.

The impact is expected to be most severe in back-office functions, risk management, and compliance—areas that form the operational backbone of banking but are now prime targets for automation. These roles involve data-heavy, repetitive processes where algorithms can process information faster and with fewer errors than human teams. Morgan Stanley estimates that banks could unlock efficiency improvements of around 30% by deploying AI more aggressively across these functions, making workforce reductions a tempting lever for improving profitability.

While the report focuses on Europe, similar dynamics are playing out globally. In the United States, Goldman Sachs warned employees as early as October about upcoming job cuts and a hiring freeze extending through the end of 2025. These measures are part of the firm’s AI-driven transformation initiative, “OneGS 3.0,” which aims to automate and streamline operations ranging from client onboarding to regulatory reporting.

Several European lenders have already begun acting on these strategies. Dutch bank ABN Amro has announced plans to reduce its workforce by around 20% by 2028, signaling a deep structural shift rather than short-term belt-tightening. At France’s Société Générale, the tone has been equally stark, with the bank’s chief executive declaring that “nothing is sacred” when it comes to efficiency and restructuring.

However, not all industry leaders are convinced that aggressive cuts are risk-free. Some senior executives have cautioned that over-reliance on automation could erode critical skills over time. A JPMorgan Chase executive told the Financial Times that if junior bankers are no longer trained in core fundamentals, the industry may pay the price later in reduced expertise and resilience.

Out of the 540 players in the NBA, Demin is the eleventh-youngest.","Progress isn’t always linear, especially when the athlete in question isn’t old enough to buy a drink.

At BYU, Egor Demin was a 6’9” walking mismatch who overwhelmed opponents with his unusual combination of size and coordination as a ball-handler. After all, he was the tallest guard measured at the NBA Combine since the league began publishing measurements in 2000!

The NBA, of course, does not care about your college dominance. There’s a physical specimen around every corner now, and the 19-year-old is still ways away from imposing his will on anyone at this level.

The rookie has been hesitant to attack the basket, taking the lowest percentage of two-point attempts on the team.

In Monday’s loss to the Golden State Warriors, Dëmin didn’t attempt a single shot in the paint and committed two costly turnovers in the fourth quarter.

“He has high expectations for himself and I’m gonna say the same,” said Jordi Fernandez. “I want more paint touches. I want more assists. I want more physicality in both ends. He’s gonna try to do his best. That’s a good thing about our young guys.”

Here’s the strange part. The 19-year-old has struggled in areas where he was expected to thrive while excelling in a spot where the concern was loudest.

All of a sudden, he can shoot. Like, really shoot.

He has made 62 three-pointers up to this point of the season, the second-most among NBA rookies. Demin knocked down seven threes against Golden State, setting a single-game franchise rookie record in the process.

At this pace, he’s on track to make 170 threes this season, which would break the Nets’ rookie record set by Kerry Kittles in 1996–97.

This newfound comfort from beyond the arc has come as a surprise, especially for a player who shot nearly 10 percent lower from three in college. At BYU, he shot 27.1 percent while attempting 4.7 threes per game, compared to 36.5% on 6.1 attempts per game this season.

A plantar fascia injury kept him from doing much of anything this summer, so all he could do was shoot from a chair while working on rhythm, mechanics, and muscle memory. Eventually, that limitation turned into a much-needed reset.

“It comes from the summer work for sure. That was one of my biggest focuses,” Demin said. “People were questioning my 3-point shot a lot, questioning if I would even shoot them. I’m lucky to have a really good coaching staff around me here that wants me to shoot any time I can.”

Now, it’s just a matter of putting it all together.

The rookie point guard has shown a willingness to improve, already packing on over 10 pounds since getting drafted in hopes of smoothing the transition to the physicality of the league.

He’s also exhibited impressive patience and self-awareness along the way, a sign he’s ready to put in the work to fully reach his potential.

“I’m much more comfortable, for sure,” Demin said. “Mentally I’m understanding the game better. And just adjusting to the game, growing the right way. Being able to spend as much time on the court as Jordi’s giving me, it’s an honor.”

After flashing his undeniable potential - and making some typical rookie mistakes - Nets veteran center Nic Claxton offered some words of encouragement to the former No. 8 overall pick after Monday’s game.

“It was a big confidence builder for him,” Nic Claxton said. “He hit some really big shots for us. Obviously, there’s still a lot of errors where he can learn from. But the sky’s the limit for him and he’ll keep getting better.”

There’s no need to rush his development. Out of the 540 players in the NBA, Demin is the eleventh-youngest.

Despite the market gains, Barclays said investor flows into UK equities remained negative.
UK equity funds recorded net outflows of $33.7 billion in 2025, making the UK the only major region to see sustained redemptions over the year.
Sector composition was a key factor supporting UK equities, Barclays said.
The brokerage also showed that value stocks outperformed in Europe, while U.S. market gains remained concentrated in growth and technology shares.","Investing.com -- The UK emerged as an unexpected equity market winner in 2025 as global investors rotated out of U.S. assets and increased exposure to international markets, according to ’ European Equity Strategy annual review.

Barclays said global equities delivered strong gains for a third straight year, with the rising 21%. Market leadership shifted away from the United States, with about 70% of MSCI country indices outperforming the U.S.

This shift reflected what Barclays described as growing cracks in U.S. exceptionalism and a renewed focus on international diversification.

The rotation accelerated early in the year after a sharp de-rating of U.S. mega-cap technology stocks linked to artificial intelligence, which triggered declines in U.S. equities and the dollar.

Barclays said concerns around monetisation, capital spending and competition in AI-heavy stocks prompted investors to reallocate toward markets outside the U.S., lifting equities across Europe, the UK, China and Japan.

European equities outperformed the U.S. by 16% in dollar terms over the year, the largest margin since 2006, Barclays said.

That outperformance was driven by strong gains in European bank stocks and the sharp fall in the dollar. In local currency terms, performance was more mixed, but dollar weakness amplified returns for non-U.S. markets, including the UK.

Within Europe, Barclays said the UK stood out given its starting position. The brokerage described the UK equity market as “deeply unloved” heading into 2025, yet UK equities recorded mid-teen percentage gains in local currency terms.

That placed the UK broadly in line with Germany, which also posted mid-teen gains, and ahead of France, which lagged with single-digit returns amid political instability.

Currency movements played a central role in relative performance, according to the brokerage. Barclays said Europe’s outperformance versus the U.S. was significantly stronger in dollar terms than in local currency terms because the U.S. dollar fell sharply during the year, boosting returns from UK and European assets for global investors.

Despite the market gains, Barclays said investor flows into UK equities remained negative. UK equity funds recorded net outflows of $33.7 billion in 2025, making the UK the only major region to see sustained redemptions over the year.

By contrast, Europe excluding the UK attracted $88.8 billion of inflows, while emerging market equity funds drew $118 billion. Barclays said this divergence showed that the UK’s equity performance occurred even as investors continued to reduce exposure.

Sector composition was a key factor supporting UK equities, Barclays said. Financial stocks, particularly banks, were among the strongest performers across Europe in 2025, benefiting UK indices with significant exposure to the sector.

The brokerage also showed that value stocks outperformed in Europe, while U.S. market gains remained concentrated in growth and technology shares.

Barclays said the UK’s performance unfolded during a year marked by tariff shocks, geopolitical tensions and shifts in monetary policy.

U.S. equities, bonds and the dollar all declined sharply at points during the year, accelerating the reallocation toward international markets, including Europe and the UK.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXNPEL3A10R_L.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 02:58:41.384805

These are all shaping up to be issues in the midterm elections.” “Maybe 2026 will start and end just like 2025 did.
Probably not.” Lots to ponder indeed going into the new year in this AI Tech Wave.","Let me add my ‘Happy New Year’s Day’ Wishes to the flood in front of us all this Friday before a holiday weekend. As I outlined yesterday, this AI Tech Wave is lined up for a similar but larger 2026 for all things AI relative to 2025. Have gone through our 2025 look-back and 2026 look forward. And it feels like it’s going to be more of the same, just more. Like the Volume turned up to 11.

The big question all year of course has been the ‘AI Bubble’ one. And all things considered, pros and cons, we’re likely not quite there. Despite anecdotal data points around and beyond AI. But timing on these things is always hard.

Especially given the macro, geopolitical headwinds that vex this tech wave differently than most ones past.

The Information rings up the pros and cons of the AI sentiments ahead well in “Get Ready for a New Year and Brace for a Very Different One”:

“For an eventful year, 2025 is ending the same way it started. A year ago, Nvidia, OpenAI and others made it clear they would do everything necessary to win the race for artificial intelligence.”

“The year ended with the same companies doing the same thing. Nvidia capped off a year of dealmaking—mostly to cement its lead in AI chips by agreeing to pay $20 billion to license technology from Groq, one of its best-funded challengers. OpenAI is ending the year with a bang too, aiming to raise $100 billion in capital and in talks with Amazon for a $10 billion investment.”

“A lot did change in the last 12 months, and some of those changes could become challenges in 2026. The biggest shift is that AI went from interesting but hypothetical for most people into a reality of everyday life.”

And of course there’ve been the ‘flashing green lights’ from the markets going brighter:

“In U.S. financial markets, AI became a powerful force. It also fed inflation by pushing up electricity prices. On the ground, it generated more grumpiness than goodwill, with communities and local officials complaining about data centers and people blaming AI for the economy’s weak job growth. Warranted or not, the companies building AI will have to deal with the fallout in 2026.”

And the deals got more fantastic and frenetic well into the last days of 2025.

“Another thing that changed: The deals got more head-scratchier, as we’ve reported. OpenAI’s quest for $100 billion raises an obvious question: Where do you get $100 billion? Nvidia’s deal for Groq raises another one: Why pay $20 billion for a company that was valued at $6.9 billion just a few months ago, and not get the whole company?”

“As I’ve written, I don’t think we’re in an AI bubble right now. That’s largely because the main funders of the buildout are the richest, most valuable companies in the world. If the Groq deal amounts to nothing, it will be little more than a scratch on Nvidia’s finances and reputation.”

Partly it’s because the $22 trillion in big tech Mag 7 market caps behind the GDP goosing hundreds of billions in AI investments last year. Growing further again this new year, with OpenAI leading the way.

“And when those cash-rich giants are not standing behind a deal, investors are now behaving pretty rationally. CoreWeave, the cloud provider that is a leveraged bet on AI, had a spectacular IPO. But investors sobered up when it struggled with data center construction delays and when doubts grew about the scale of its borrowing. The stock is down 60% from its peak.”

“In retrospect, the peak of AI euphoria may have occurred on Sept. 10 when Oracle added nearly $250 billion in market capitalization after reporting a huge increase in future contract revenue, largely tied to AI. Since then, Oracle is down 40% and that $250 billion is long gone.”

“Now, the market is quick to deliver its harsh judgment. Fermi America, the young data center developer cofounded by former Texas Governor Rick Perry, had a successful IPO a few weeks after Oracle’s big day, when AI euphoria was still in the air. But Fermi said in mid-December it lost a data center tenant. Its shares fell 40%. Something pretty amazing will need to happen for investors to fall in love with CoreWeave, Oracle or Fermi again.”

Those AI Infrastructure plays have had their ups and downs last year.

“The worst investor behavior may be over, but you can bet that market strategists and financial advisers are still talking about an AI bubble with their clients. The advice is the same: diversify. The seven giant tech stocks account for 36% of the S&P 500’s value and 26% of its earnings, according to Goldman Sachs. What about the other 493 stocks, or the rest of the world for that matter?”

“If investors do diversify, it will mean selling tech stocks and buying everything else, including foreign stocks, which collectively trounced the tech giants in 2025.”

“Another headwind could be interest rates. Everyone in Silicon Valley remembers the wreckage wrought by the Federal Reserve when it raised interest rates in 2022. Now, the Fed is cutting short-term interest rates. But recently, long-term rates haven’t followed them down.”

Especially given the margin and balance sheet math concerns around these AI investments that continue and accelerate this year.

“If President Donald Trump’s new appointee to lead the Fed loses credibility with investors, they could start to worry about inflation and push up long-term rates. That could squeeze any remaining speculation out of the AI buildout.”

“The last potential shift is politics. The tech industry went into 2025 with a ton of political power in everything from AI to crypto to antitrust regulation. Now the industry faces fears of AI-driven job losses, higher electricity prices, and a boom and bust in speculative crypto that has cost investors—not the crypto industry—dearly. These are all shaping up to be issues in the midterm elections.”

“Maybe 2026 will start and end just like 2025 did. Probably not.”

Lots to ponder indeed going into the new year in this AI Tech Wave. Eyes wide open for us all starting monday.

ID39,S&P Global,2026-01-02 04:13:19+00:00,The Detroit News,Ford had a record-breaking recall year. Here's how it plans to fix quality - The Detroit News,Breana Noble,,,,,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2026/01/01/ford-recalls-record-year-2025/87706806007/,"Ford Motor Co. ended a record-breaking recall year with 152 notices to consumers in 2025 concerning safety issues or product defects requiring repair.
The recall totals are a sign of the Blue Oval's prioritization of quality, safety and warranty cost reductions, Ford executives said.
Initial quality for products rolling off the line in 2025 is among Ford's best ever, according to internal data, said Josh Halliburton, Ford's executive director of quality.
Ford has increased its monitoring for quality problems, Galhotra said.
Shoring up manufacturing operations, adding camera systems and implementing plant-specific targets for process improvements are also ways in which Ford is seeking to improve quality.","Ford Motor Co. ended a record-breaking recall year with 152 notices to consumers in 2025 concerning safety issues or product defects requiring repair. But executives say quality costs are improving.

The Dearborn automaker nearly doubled the record previously set by General Motors Co. of 77 recalls in 2014, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's recall tracker. From faulty parking modules that create the potential for rollaways to risks of parts detaching from SUVs to notices that an electrical short may create conditions for a fire to spark, issues have run the gamut. And those cost the automaker time, money and reputation among consumers.

""I would like the consumers to know that we stand behind our products,"" Kumar Galhotra, Ford's chief operating officer, said in an interview with The Detroit News. ""Our initial quality has improved substantially this year, and if something does go wrong with their vehicle, I want them to know that we will act promptly to take care of it.""

Stellantis NV reported 53 recalls in 2025. GM was fourth in recalls with 27, according to NHTSA, behind RV manufacturer Forest River.

The recall totals are a sign of the Blue Oval's prioritization of quality, safety and warranty cost reductions, Ford executives said. Over the past two years, the company doubled its safety team to find and fix problems, and now it is testing critical systems to failure. Initial quality for products rolling off the line in 2025 is among Ford's best ever, according to internal data, said Josh Halliburton, Ford's executive director of quality.

But for customers, recalls can come with frustrations. John MacLellan, 37, an attorney in Jacksonville, Florida, faced challenges with buying a Mustang Mach-E this summer after the automaker ordered dealers not to deliver the electric vehicles due to a lockout issue.

""They text me that they'll get the keys ready, and then I hear nothing, and I hear nothing,"" MacLellan said about reaching out to a dealer to buy the SUV. ""I see the news on Reddit. It makes you a little leery that it could theoretically trap a kid inside.""

Ford last month also cited cost improvements in its announcement to raise its 2025 adjusted operating earning guidance to about $7 billion. That was up from $6 billion to $6.5 billion it stated in November, though still would represent a more than 30% decrease from 2024 following the advent of President Donald Trump's tariffs, supply chain disruptions, the expiration of the federal plug-in vehicle tax credit and consumer sentiment deterioration. Ford will report annual financial results on Feb. 10.

Galhotra declined to provide financial specifics, citing the company's blackout period ahead of reporting earnings, but said costs have improved for multiple quarters now and part of that is quality and warranty.

""Our warranty costs are going down,"" he said, ""and that's obviously directly related to improving initial quality of the vehicles that we're selling, and improving the cost of repairs, and lowering the repairs for vehicles already in customers' hands.""

Last year's recalls included about 40 reissued related to software. An audit found the company didn't have a robust way of ensuring the software was in the right place. The effort was to ensure the software had been installed correctly.

Increasingly, recalls are able to be fixed with over-the-air updates. Nonetheless, dealers like Jim Seavitt, owner of Village Ford in Dearborn, said their service departments regularly have full-day schedules of addressing recalls. Meanwhile, dozens of new vehicles sit on the lot, unable to be delivered because they need a fix.

""They’ve taken a lot of what could be customer-paid work, and they don’t pay that well,"" Seavitt said of the impact of the recall repairs on his business. ""It used to be: 'Quality is job one.' Somewhere, they lost that.""

Consumers weigh dozens of matters in a decision to buy a vehicle, including recalls and repairs, said Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global Mobility's AutoIntelligence principal automotive analyst. They can forgive a mistake, but how an automaker addresses the problem is what really makes a difference.

""Some people get a bunch of recall notices and don’t think it's important and don’t do anything about it,"" she said. ""Having a ton of recalls looks bad, but on the other hand, it's how well it’s handled from the consumers’ perspective — how quickly, how well or how efficiently.""

Recalls also aren't the only way to assess quality. Automakers regularly release fixes, especially over-the-air updates, that aren't safety-related. Issuing those repairs, however, shows how a company is standing behind its product, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions LLC.

""The screens and hybrids and all the different technology that has gone into every vehicle today ... there are going to be stumbles along the way,"" he said. ""Ford might be showing all of its issues, whereas other manufacturers probably haven’t displayed problems that they’re likely having. Ford, being family-owned, they’re not going to let the lawyers take care of everything.""

According to an analysis by DeMayo Law Offices LLP, however, Ford was the top brand to be involved in class action lawsuits between 2020 and 2025. A study from automotive search iSeeCars.com looking at more than 30 years of recalls between 1985 and 2016 found Ford in that timeframe was the least proactive in issuing recalls.

Ford has increased its monitoring for quality problems, Galhotra said. But ultimately, it doesn't matter from where an initial indicator of a problem comes, but that the automaker is in a position to address the issue, he said.

Galhotra illustrated the complexity of addressing software bugs: A driver simply opening the vehicle door, sitting down, turning on the vehicle and putting their seatbelt on creates all sorts of scenarios.

""Someone might get in the vehicle after opening the door in 100 milliseconds. Somebody might do that in 500 milliseconds,"" he said. ""Somebody might turn on the radio first. Someone might put on the seatbelt first.

""You have to develop software validation tools,"" he continued, ""that can simulate that sequence millions and millions of times to make sure that there isn't a bug where in one particular case, at one particular sequence, it's going to cause an issue.""

Third-party product testing has validated Ford's claims of improved quality. Ford scaled Consumer Reports' brand reliability ranking, finishing at No. 11 in the top half of all brands included, up from No. 22 the year prior. It was its best placement in the past 15 years. Lincoln was No. 20.

In an overall ranking that includes owner satisfaction, road-test rating ranking and safety, Lincoln was the top-ranked Detroit Three brand at No. 7. Ford was No. 18. Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of testing, described the recent innovations on new Fords as ""really, really impressive.""

Likewise, in J.D. Power's 2025 Initial Quality Study that looks at consumers' first 90 days of ownership, the Ford brand had more top finishers in their respective segments than any other, though General Motors Co. as a company had the most top-ranked vehicles.

Still, the IQS scores for Ford and luxury brand Lincoln overall fell below the industry average. J.D. Power's dependability study looks at owners' experience after three years. Ford and Lincoln were also below average there, but they were the most improved brands.

The company has also updated its software validation processes. It's leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect issues sooner, as well. Shoring up manufacturing operations, adding camera systems and implementing plant-specific targets for process improvements are also ways in which Ford is seeking to improve quality.

When the process of making changes to address Ford's quality problems began, the sources were spread about fairly evenly between issues in design, manufacturing procedures and supplier processes, Galhotra said. The breakdown has moved over that time as Ford has split its teams between hardware and software, conducted audits and increased the use of data to identify problems.

""Those are the three big areas,"" Galhotra said, ""we've been really, really deep into, multiple strategies that include processes, tools, people, to make sure that the designs are robust, make sure the suppliers are supplying high quality products and making sure our manufacturing facilities are not adding any air states into the vehicles that we ship to our customers.""

Video allegedly taken from inside the vehicle, filmed by Momohara and published by the outlet, showed the car careening down the road and nearly hitting highway barriers. At one point, the car drove over a sidewalk as Momohara and her boyfriend yelled for the driver to stop the car.

They can be heard telling him to ""take a right"" and ""slow down"" at various points throughout the video.

“I am clearly just freaking out and asking this man to stop the vehicle,” Momohara said of the video. “At that moment, panic started to hit in, and we weren’t even sure if or what was happening.”

When the car finally did stop, Momohara called 911, claiming the driver told her boyfriend, ""If you don’t get out of the vehicle, I’m going to hurt you.""

""He started to press on the gas, so my boyfriend said, 'Okay, I’ll get out,'” Momohara added.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission approved the final draft of this strategy in March 2024, following nearly four years of collaborative planning with more than 60 volunteer stakeholders. The development of individual Feedground Management Action Plans is the next step in this process, and the department will be working closely with stakeholders and the public to address key concerns and priorities.

Specific FMAPs will be developed for each of the six elk herds and their corresponding feedgrounds in the Jackson and Pinedale regions. They are intended to be a playbook of strategies guiding feedground management through biological, social and economic factors. FMAPs are designed to be adaptable as on the ground conditions change and science emerges. Game and Fish will work closely with key stakeholders and the public during this development phase. Draft FMAP documents will be shared during a series of public meetings that will be announced later this month on the Game and Fish website.",https://sheridanmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img-0045_crop.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 22:58:20.145977

Meanwhile, gaming GPU prices could get even more expensive.

What happened: If it’s a day ending in y, chances are major AI companies are making deals. This week alone, there are reports that:

Google and Meta are teaming up to make Google’s in-house AI chips play nicer with the leading AI development framework, which was originally developed at Meta.

Meta is in talks to spend billions on Google’s chips, generally much cheaper than Nvidia’s, starting in 2027.

Amazon may inject up to $10 billion into OpenAI, an investment that would see the ChatGPT-maker use more of Amazon’s AI chips.

These new partnerships show just how much key AI players want alternatives to Nvidia, even as they continue to strike deals with the GPU giant.

Why it matters: Right now, Nvidia is the go-to chip provider in AI computing, partly because it’s easiest to use. Its programming layer and developer tools platform, which makes AI code run efficiently on Nvidia GPUs, is the industry standard. It doesn’t mean the software is irreplaceable, but first-mover advantage has a hell of a gravitational pull: One widely cited estimate put Nvidia at having 85% of the global AI chip market as of mid-2025. That market dominance has given Nvidia a lot of control over pricing and the terms of the deals it strikes. If one company can set the going rate for the most in-demand hardware, everyone else ends up paying a premium until real substitutes exist at scale.

What does this mean for you?: For consumers, Nvidia’s primacy in the AI fervor doesn’t bode well for gaming GPU prices, which have already been sky-high for years now. New reports suggest Nvidia could be cutting up to 40% of gaming GPU production in 2026.

Is dethroning Nvidia realistic?: No one is snatching the crown from a $4 trillion-dollar company tomorrow. More realistically, what we might see in the next few years is a slow erosion of Nvidia’s power. If alternative chips become easy to use with mainstream AI tools, Nvidia’s share could slide from “total domination” to just “enormous.” —WK","https://morningbrew.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,quality=70,format=auto/https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2025-12-18/image-936b334032f05a206a97bc9748955b42ebac09de-2304x1292-jpg/GoogleMeta.jpg",N,,2026-01-01 23:13:49.283964

Closure to bring in £700 million a year to help cut waiting lists, cut debt and borrowing, and cut the cost of living.

As announced at the Budget by the Chancellor, private hire vehicle operators in London will no longer be able to use the Tour Operators Margin Scheme - a niche tax scheme designed for tour operators and holiday coach trips – to significantly reduce the VAT they pay on fares.

This means that black cabs will no longer have to compete with online mini cab firms who are misusing this scheme to pay less VAT.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

We’re putting the brakes on the illegitimate use of a niche tax scheme to protect everyday cabbies. We’ll use the £700m a year this raises to deliver the country’s priorities - cutting the cost of living, cutting waiting lists and cutting debt and borrowing.

Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said:

The government’s decision to apply VAT to all private hire journeys is a landmark step for fairness and integrity in our industry. For too long, drivers and small operators paying the full 20% VAT have had to compete with online mini cab firms benefiting from a niche tax scheme.

We welcome this move and commend the government for taking decisive action.

The Tour Operator’s Margin Scheme is a specialist VAT rule designed for genuine travel and holiday businesses, allowing them to pay VAT only on the profit they make on package trips, not the full fare, typically reducing the effective VAT rate to 4%.

First announced by the Chancellor at Budget 2025, today’s measure will prevent the small number of big companies accessing the Tour Operator’s Margin Scheme, as they have been doing.

By supporting fairer competition, the government is protecting around £700 million in revenue, helping deliver the public’s priorities - cutting waiting lists, cutting debt and borrowing, and cutting the cost of living.

From securing sites for antimony refineries and tracking gold price outlooks to revisiting legal battles and responding to underground emergencies, here is a countdown of the 10 most-read North of 60 Mining News articles of 2025.

No. 10 – Greenland caught in resource power struggle

The tenth most popular North of 60 Mining News article of 2025 examined the competing interests shaping mineral development in Greenland and the broader implications for Arctic resource governance.

As global demand for rare earths and other critical minerals accelerates, Greenland has emerged as a focal point for governments and companies seeking secure, non-Chinese supply sources. The article examined how these pressures intersect with local debates over environmental protection, Indigenous rights, and political autonomy, highlighting the complexity of resource development in the Arctic.

For readers who have long followed North of 60 Mining News' coverage of Alaska and northern Canada, the Greenland story offered a case study in how northern jurisdictions are grappling with challenges and opportunities of supplying the minerals needed for modern economies while retaining local control over resource decisions – an increasingly familiar challenge across the North.

No. 9 – USGS director champions domestic mining

Landing at No. 9 on the North of 60 Mining New 2025 Top Ten, this article provided insights into the newly confirmed U.S. Geological Survey Director Ned Mamula's call for renewed investment in domestic mining to strengthen supply chains and economic resilience.

The story highlighted the importance of geological mapping, resource assessments, and science-based decision-making in promoting responsible mining. Alaska featured prominently as a jurisdiction where strong mineral potential, paired with robust geoscience data, could help reduce reliance on foreign supplies.

North of 60 Mining News readers responded to the article's practical focus on how better information and clearer policy signals can translate into real project advancement –particularly in America's Last Frontier state, where geology and logistics play an outsized role in development decisions.

No. 8 – Anglo, Teck to merge into $53B copper giant

The No. 8 most-read article of 2025 covered the pending merger of Anglo American and Teck Resources, a deal set to create a $53 billion critical minerals-focused mining company.

The story examined how this consolidation among major producers reflects long-term demand expectations for copper tied to electrification, infrastructure, and energy transition technologies. It also considered what the merger could mean for project prioritization and investment strategies in northern mining jurisdictions.

For mining companies, investors, policymakers, and stakeholders across the North, the Anglo Teck article connected a major mining merger to potential downstream impacts on exploration funding, development timelines, and competition for capital allocations for projects across Alaska and northern Canada.

No. 7 – Skibinski presses for mining policies in DC

The seventh most-read article provided insights into Alaska Miners Association Executive Director Deantha Skibinski's Washington, D.C., advocacy for policies supporting responsible domestic mining.

The story detailed discussions around permitting reform, infrastructure investment, and regulatory clarity – issues that directly affect whether mining projects in Alaska deliver the minerals critical to America's economy and national security, or stall. It provided readers with a clear look at how industry voices are engaging federal policymakers to address long-standing development barriers at a time when Alaska is increasingly viewed as a strategic resource to the U.S.

The article serves as a reminder that decisions made thousands of miles away can have immediate and long-term consequences for mining projects and economies across the North.

No. 6 – Alaska mining is achieving critical mass

The sixth most-read North of 60 Mining News article of 2025 explored how Alaska's mining sector is approaching a pivotal moment when soaring metals prices, favorable federal policies, and the potential development of world-class mining projects have converged.

While Alaska's mining industry has been building toward critical mass for decades, the 2024 election started a chain reaction that could sustain sector growth over the coming decade.

The significance of Alaska's mineral wealth and strategic Arctic location is now a headlining topic of national conversation – from the Pentagon to the White House and Capitol Hill.

""Strategically, Alaska is one of the most important states for our nation, with its location, minerals, land, and natural resource assets,"" Congressman Pete Stauber (R-Minn.) said during an August tour of Alaska.

The article captured a growing sense that Alaska's mining future is increasingly defined not only by its world-renowned geology, but also by an increasing recognition of the Far North State's enormous capacity to deliver a domestic supply of minerals and metals critical to America's economic well-being and national security.

No. 5 – S&P Global forecasts strong gold prices

Landing at No. 5, this article reported on S&P Global's forecast for continued strength in gold prices and what that could mean for mineral exploration and mining across the North.

Gold remains a cornerstone of mining in Alaska and northern Canada, and the outlook reinforced the precious metal's role in supporting exploration, mine expansions, and new development.

At the time this article was published, gold mining companies and their investors were celebrating the potential that the precious metal would break through the $3,000/oz barrier. Over the following 10 months, the price of gold has continued to climb more than 50% to fresh new highs above $4,500/oz.

The record gold prices heading into 2026 exceed S&P Global's most bullish predictions at the beginning of 2025. While the global financial analyst foresees a pullback in prices, even the steepest retreat is expected to land higher than record highs set just 18 months ago.

The S&P Global gold forecast story provided mining companies with gold mines and projects across Alaska and Canada's North with a reason to celebrate going into 2025. The steep and steady climb throughout the year, however, far exceeded what was viewed as a bullish forecast when the article was published.

No. 4 – Red Chris mine workers trapped underground

The fourth most-read article of 2025 covered a pair of underground mine collapses that trapped three workers at the Red Chris copper-gold mine in British Columbia's Golden Triangle.

The story provided a first glimpse into the underground mine emergency as the events were unfolding, and set the stage for articles that provided readers with updates as Newmont, the provincial government, and the wider mining sector deployed the latest technologies to quickly rescue the three trapped miners, without putting other workers in harm's way.

The story underscored the importance of preparedness, communication, and emergency response systems.

Its high readership reflected the mining community's deep concern for the safety of the underground miners at Red Chris, and a solidarity across operations, jurisdictions, and companies when incidents occur.

No. 3 – Alaska revives U.S. antimony supply chain

Coming in at No. 3 on North of 60 Mining News' 2025 Top Ten is an article that detailed Alaska's growing role in reviving a domestic antimony supply chain after decades of U.S. dependence on foreign sources.

The article highlighted how the emerging deposits of high-grade antimony at Alaska mine projects could help restore a secure, domestic supply of this metalloid critical to defense, manufacturing, and energy applications.

Readers were drawn to a potential link between high-grade antimony mineralization on the outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska, U.S. Antimony's smelter in Montana, and a $245 U.S. Defense Logistics Agency contract to deliver antimony bars into the nation's strategic stockpile.

The article reinforced Alaska's importance in addressing U.S. critical mineral supply vulnerabilities while creating new economic opportunities in the state.

No. 2 – Pebble back in court over EPA veto

The second-most-read article of 2025 reported on renewed legal challenges surrounding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's veto of the proposed Pebble mine.

The long-running dispute over the development of a mine at the world-class Pebble copper-gold-silver-molybdenum-rhenium deposit in Southwest Alaska remains one of the U.S.'s most closely watched mining cases, and readers closely followed its return to the courtroom. The article examined what the latest legal developments surrounding the Pebble case could mean for permitting certainty and federal authority over large mining projects in Alaska and across the nation.

Its strong readership reflected Pebble's world-class critical minerals potential and the enduring influence the project has on perceptions of regulatory risk, investment climate, and the future of large-scale mining in Alaska.

No. 1 – Alaska antimony refinery site secured

Coming in at No. 1 on North of 60 Mining News' Top Ten articles of 2025 is a story that provided readers with unprecedented insights into Nova Minerals' securing of a site for an antimony refinery at Port MacKenzie near Anchorage, Alaska.

The milestone marked a concrete step toward adding downstream critical mineral processing capacity in America's Last Frontier state, moving beyond extraction and closer to a fully integrated supply chain. Readers responded to the project's implications for job creation, economic diversification, and Alaska's growing position as a key supplier of domestic critical minerals.

Its top ranking reflected strong interest in developments that translate Alaska's resources into operating facilities with lasting implications for the state's economy and the nation's mineral security.",https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/1/9/9419/s_top,N,,2026-01-01 19:59:23.880793

However, the pharmaceutical giant reached these levels because it has faced significant headwinds, resulting in a poor stock market performance over the past three years.

Yet, what is the outlook for the struggling giant from here? Is Pfizer worth investing in at current levels?

Slowly engineering a comeback

Pfizer's revenue and earnings have been inconsistent over the past few years. To make matters worse, the drugmaker will encounter important patent cliffs within a few years, including that of Eliquis, an anticoagulant and one of its best-selling drugs. Even so, the company has been gradually earning new approvals, some of which should have a meaningful impact on its financial results as label expansions are secured.

Further, Pfizer has doubled down on acquisitions, which has helped it improve its pipeline. The company now has a comprehensive list of candidates across multiple therapeutic areas, with a particular focus on cancer. It also boasts a promising candidate for weight loss. Pfizer should launch several new products that will bolster its lineup through the end of the decade.

Plataformas como Workday responden con “explicabilidad algorítmica”: al finalizar una evaluación, el sistema muestra qué factores (desempeño, habilidades blandas, etc.) influyeron en el resultado. “Antes, los trabajadores se sentían juzgados por una caja negra. Ahora, la IA es un espejo con instrucciones”, explica Clara Ríos, directora de Recursos Humanos en BBVA México.

La privacidad también está en juego. En 2025, la UE amplió el GDPR para incluir “datos emocionales” (estrés, engagement) recolectados por herramientas como Microsoft Viva o Peakon. Las multas por mal uso pueden alcanzar el 4% de la facturación global. Por eso, gigantes como SAP han creado comités internos donde empleados revisan qué datos se recopilan y cómo se procesan.

Pero no todo es regulación. Algunas empresas convierten la ética en ventaja competitiva. Salesforce, por ejemplo, lanzó en 2024 su Ethical AI Toolkit, que permite a los equipos de RRHH simular escenarios de contratación para detectar sesgos. Y en IBM, los algoritmos de desarrollo de talento se entrenan con datos anónimos de 50 países para garantizar diversidad cultural. Los resultados son tangibles: según Forbes (2025), estas compañías tienen un 40% más de candidatos diversos en procesos de selección.

El futuro del trabajo exige un equilibrio delicado. Mientras el 76% de los CEO presionan por más automatización en RRHH (IDC, 2025), el 61% de los empleados exigen controles humanos en decisiones críticas (Gallup, 2025). La respuesta está en la colaboración: en Accenture, los gerentes reciben alertas de IA cuando un algoritmo sugiere una acción riesgosa (ej.: despedir a alguien con alto potencial). “La tecnología propone, el humano dispone”, resume Marcos Silva, líder de ética digital de la firma.",https://www.prevencionintegral.com/system/temporary/filefield_paths/gettyimages-2184521737.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 20:13:25.371322
ID5,AXA,2026-01-01 23:32:50+00:00,https://www.bangkokpost.com,Insurers face a raft of economic challenges - Bangkok Post,Not Available,,,,,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3167470/insurers-face-a-raft-of-economic-challenges,"Unfavourable economic conditions, political instability, soaring medical costs and natural disaster risks are the top challenges facing insurance companies in Thailand, while the country's ageing society could support continued health insurance expansion.
Guillaume Mirabaud, chief executive of AXA Insurance Thailand, said there are several challenges for 2026, with the top concern the economic context.
""This is a strong reminder that Thai society needs to prepare for more extreme events, as climate change is not theoretical,"" said Mr Mirabaud.
""Individuals and small business owners should be aware they will need better coverage,"" said Mr Mirabaud.
On health insurance, the key challenge will be to keep medical costs under control, so that more people can access private insurance and be better protected.","Unfavourable economic conditions, political instability, soaring medical costs and natural disaster risks are the top challenges facing insurance companies in Thailand, while the country's ageing society could support continued health insurance expansion.

Guillaume Mirabaud, chief executive of AXA Insurance Thailand, said there are several challenges for 2026, with the top concern the economic context.

""Global macro uncertainty is unfavourable for business development. Further stabilisation may help a return to a more favourable trend,"" he said.

""Political instability in the country is another negative factor, as investors and companies lack predictability.""

In terms of insurance, he said the key risk is natural catastrophes following the earthquake in March and several floods, including the recent inundation in the southern provinces.

""This is a strong reminder that Thai society needs to prepare for more extreme events, as climate change is not theoretical,"" said Mr Mirabaud.

Insurance companies should revise their underwriting as prices will ""inevitably increase"", he said.

""Individuals and small business owners should be aware they will need better coverage,"" said Mr Mirabaud.

On the regulatory front, he said insurers are expected to be improved, with Thai risk monitoring and good insurance practices catching up with more mature markets.

""This includes setting up ground rules for electric vehicles, which have resulted in heavy losses to date, as well as eventually enforcing a named driver for each motor policy,"" said Mr Mirabaud.

On health insurance, the key challenge will be to keep medical costs under control, so that more people can access private insurance and be better protected. ""This requires a strong political will to contain medical expenses and a deal between medical providers and insurance sectors under the monitoring of regulator and government,"" Mr Mirabaud stressed.

Besides macroeconomic and political instability, the low-interest rate environment is another major headwind that insurers are encountering, says the Thai unit of German insurer Allianz.

The Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee, at its final meeting of 2025, lowered the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25% to help an economy beset by multiple challenges including political uncertainty, a strengthening baht, and US tariffs.

The central bank also said it would continue to ease monetary policy to support economic growth

Thomas Wilson, country manager, president and chief executive of Allianz Ayudhya Assurance, said low interest rates do not help attract investments to unit-linked products, a type of life insurance policy that combines life insurance protection with investment opportunities through unit-linked funds.

""I think consumer confidence and their willingness to commit to long-term savings and long-term health premiums is decreasing,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Thailand is approaching a demographic milestone, with 21.3% of the population over 60 in 2025. The figure is projected to rise to 25% in 2030 and nearly 30% by 2040.

""Thailand has one of the oldest demographics in the world, with the trend likely to accelerate,"" said Mr Wilson.

Coupled with demographics, the increase of emerging diseases is among the factors driving health insurance premiums, which are expected to expand by nearly 10% in both 2025 and this year, according to Piyapadh Vana-Ukrit, chairman of the accident and health insurance committee at the Thai General Insurance Association.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20260102/c1_3167470_260102053254_700.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 18:59:27.796104

A former member of Samsung`s open recruitment company, he has worked at six financial institutions to develop financial products and review credit investment, and plans to post something on the treadmill at 6 a.m. every morning. The book he mentioned on his blog jumps 100 spots in sales in a day, and the industry he covered in his article becomes the biggest concern for investors.

To make money from investment, you shouldn't move the same way as others. You must understand the flow of the world and prepare for the future to come. This is why the ""power to read 1%"" is important in the flood of information. Kim Yu-shin's 'Deep Money Talk' introduces his world reading and investment philosophy through a written interview with 'Mer'.

How to choose and write blog content...

Q. How did you first write on your blog.

A. I started writing on my blog in earnest because I needed to organize my thoughts. I think if your thoughts stay in your head, you will have more gaps. In the process of organizing thoughts in writing, I started a blog with a light heart to fill in the gaps.

Q. Could you briefly introduce your career.

A. After joining Samsung through open recruitment, he has worked at six financial companies including GE. Financial companies have accumulated expertise in the field of financial product development. Financial product development is called the flower of financial companies. This is because proper financial product development is possible only when the entire area such as sales, marketing, risk management, and profitability is understood to the bottom.

Recently, he is in charge of reviewing and approving large loan investments. Wide knowledge and trained judgment skills are required because various investments must be handled, not just loans. The process of writing is the process of making acquired data and information mine. It is a great help to broaden your knowledge and improve your judgment skills.

Q. If there are any criteria for selecting a blog post.

A. I start working out at 6 a.m. They walk on the treadmill for about an hour and allocate the priorities of what to do that day. After that, blog posts are also selected while learning. The criteria for selecting a topic is 'what I'm curious about as of today'. When you find out what you are curious about and organize it, the writing is born.

Q. The scope of the writing is wide but the depth is considerable, but how do you collect information.

A. I think it's a combination of books, searches, and internal reports. I visit the library near my house on weekends. I borrow 14 books from the library on average a month. I get the most information from the book, but there are also disadvantages to the information I get from the book. Since time spent writing, editing, and publishing books is included, recent information is often missing. This part is supplemented with a search.

Mer's investment secret

Q. If you have your own investment philosophy.

A. Aim to produce a robust profit with a good balance of risk and return. This is why they prefer to organize and operate their portfolios rather than individual stocks.

Q. What is the way to balance risk and profit.

A. In practice, the '+5% & -2%' rule is used a lot. It's a personal theory, not an academic theory.

When dealing with a lot of investments, I learned from my experience that removing the risk of about 2% will balance the return and risk even if I allow a close 5% more.

If risk and additional revenue are presented as a kind of set product, they have a lot of experience that negotiations have proceeded smoothly while balancing risk and return.

Q. What was your most successful investment experience.

A. I would like to point out my experience of overcoming the 2008 financial crisis through insurance hedging.

In 2006, two years before the financial crisis, I visited a subprime mortgage company and heard the product description, and I was convinced that there was a problem with the market. So, I pushed for insurance products to hedge risks. There were also loud voices of opposition within the company because it had to pay 10 billion won a year only in insurance premiums. After signing up for an insurance product, housing prices rose, leading to criticism of my decision to sign up for the product.

At that time, the product was heard through Berkshire Hathaway, owned by Warren Buffett. When the financial crisis came, the insurance products that were subscribed were powerful, and eventually, they were able to receive insurance payments up to 7.4 times the premiums paid at the time. About 200 billion won was received from Berkshire Hathaway.

Q. What investment did you lose the most.

A. There is no big loss of investment. This is because losses are only allowed up to 0.2% on investments. In other words, if the investment of 1 trillion won is approved, the amount of damage allowed is 2 billion won. There is no experience of failure to invest in individual approval cases, but if the unapproved case goes well, it will be regrettable.

Asset Market Outlook for 2026

Q. Last year, artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks rose significantly. Will this trend continue this year.

A. I think next year's AI will be a winner-take-all trend. Only one or two leading companies survive, and I think we will see the process of losing companies losing huge investments and being kicked out of the market within two to three years.

Those who made money in the gold rush to find gold mines in the western United States were not gold seekers. Levi Strauss, who made jeans for miners' work clothes, or Bamuel Brannon, who became California's first millionaire by selling food and tools to miners, made money. James Marshall, who discovered gold in Coloma, was poor in his later years, and John Southerner found gold in his land, but lost his property due to manpower outflows and looting.

Q. Are there any new industries that will emerge in terms of investment.

A. Companies that supply parts and services to AI companies seem to be more accessible than AI companies. Personally, I am also interested in space data centers.

Q. If you are looking at the domestic real estate market.

A. The big trend is polarization. Seoul, the metropolitan area, and key provincial areas with jobs will continue to maintain their values, but the rest of the region is not easy.

In terms of regulation, it will be difficult to maintain the land transaction permit system (toilet system) for all areas of Seoul and parts of the metropolitan area until the end of this year. I think we will have no choice but to lift the local tax system and touch the holding tax in key areas where prices are not set.

Jeonse will be quickly replaced by monthly rent, and rising housing costs are likely to be an inevitable trend.

Mer's principle of asset allocation is

Q. If you have your own asset allocation principle.

A. The shares are intended to be distributed within 50%. Looking at the portfolio, it consists of 50% of stocks, 10% of gold and silver, and 40% of cash equivalents (including short-term government bonds).

There were about 20% of U.S. government bonds, but the proportion of cash equivalents increased by organizing them.

Q. Looking at the portfolio we disclosed, it doesn't seem to have a U.S. stock weight.

A. It has been investing long-term in the Korean shipbuilding industry with a Japanese general trading company since 2023. This alone makes it impossible to invest in U.S. stocks because nearly half of the portfolio is full.

Q. Why do you invest in shipbuilding.

A. They prefer industry analysis to individual companies. Although it is currently in a recession, I thought to find an industry that has an opportunity to grow, and the industry that I found was the shipbuilding industry.

Eco-friendly power generation was the trend, but this alone seemed to have limitations in securing the necessary energy. As the proportion of LNG use is expected to increase for a while, Korea naturally drew attention as an LNG ship with strengths.

Q. How did you decide the timing of your investment.

A. The shipbuilding industry thought the timing of the deficit turning into a surplus was the timing of investment. It put about 5% of its weight into shipbuilding-related ETFs in 2023, and expanded its share of investment in 2025 when it is certain to turn into a surplus. It is an ETF investment, but the rate of return is more than three times.

Q. What is your portfolio plan for this year.

A. Do not plan a portfolio on an annual basis. They check that the stocks they are currently investing in stop rising completely and replace them.

I don't have much dissatisfaction with the current portfolio, so I'm going to watch the environment change by dragging it until this year.

Q. Which investors do you respect or want to resemble.

A. It's Warren Buffett. It is a wonder that it is not a frequent sale, but a long-term possession and sufficient profit.

Q. If you have a goal in your life.

A. I don't want to do anything I don't want to do, but I want to live by focusing on what I want to do.

Q. If you have any goals for the new year.

A. I'm planning to write my next book, The Power of Reading 1%.

Q. If you could advise a new person in society who is new to social life regarding his or her work life.

A. There is a famous adage in Yeouido that says, ""The number of office workers is their personality."" When a number usually called performance comes out, words gain strength and people who mess with it disappear. I think concentrating on my job and producing results is the most important attitude toward working life.

Mer's book, ""The Power to Read 1%.""

The ""power to read 1%"" deals with the ""technology of insight"" that reads the nature and flow of issues in vast amounts of data and complex news. Author Mer emphasizes the importance of 'connection intelligence' that connects fragmented information into one complete context.

In particular, it deals with key global economic issues such as semiconductors, energy, currency, and real estate in various ways and presents practical analysis methods. In other words, it is a book that gives you a glimpse of Mer's secret to looking behind the phenomenon.

Readers of this book will practice asking why it happened and what will come next, not what happened. In other words, it is a book that expands critical thinking and helps investors move preemptively through information acquisition. If there are readers who want to interpret the world from their own perspective and preempt future opportunities, I recommend reading the ""power to read 1%.""

For the moment, suffice to say that the old 1 percent difference statistic is the latest icon of evolution to fall.","Editor’s note: Welcome to a Science and Culture Today tradition: a countdown of our Top 10 favorite stories of the past year, concluding now on New Year’s Day. This article was originally published on May 20, 2025. Our staff are enjoying the holidays, as we hope that you are, too! Help keep the daily voice of intelligent design going strong. Please give whatever you can to support the Center for Science and Culture now!

How many times have you heard it said that the human and chimpanzee genomes are so similar that they are only “1 percent different” at the level of their DNA? This shows, we were told, not only that humans and chimps share common ancestry, but that humans aren’t all that special, which is a common talking point in science journalism and other public discussions. After all, we’re just slightly modified chimps! This “fact” has been discussed so much that it has become what the late biologist Jonathan Wells famously called an “icon of evolution.”

But now, new data reported in a recently published Nature paper by Yoo et al. has overturned this previous claim. The new findings reveal that human DNA is far more different from chimp DNA than previously thought.

That should be major news in the science world, yet those involved don’t seem interested in highlighting their discovery. More on that later.

Many times over the years, I’ve discussed how this 1 percent claim about humans and chimps is likely wrong. It is also misleading. No matter how similar humans might be to chimps at the genetic level, anyone who has been to the zoo knows already that chimps and humans are vastly different. After all, we’re the ones writing scientific papers about them—not the other way around. So common sense alone dictates that there is something misleading about that number and how it is used. But the new data show that the previous statistic isn’t just misleading. It’s flat-out false.

As I will elaborate in a subsequent article, this team of researchers has published “complete” sequences of ape genomes that were created ‘from scratch’ rather than using the human genome as a template. As a result, for the first time we can attempt a much more accurate assessment of the true degree of difference between the human and chimp genomes.

The results are groundbreaking:

At least 12.5 percent and possibly up to 13.3 percent of the chimp and human genomes represent a “gap difference” between the two genomes. That means there’s a “gap” in one genome compared to the other, often where they are so different, they cannot even be aligned.

There are also significant alignable sections of the two genomes that show “short nucleotide variations” which differ by only about 1.5 percent. We can add this difference to the “gap difference,” and calculate a 14 percent to 14.9 percent total difference between human and chimp genomes. This means that the actual difference between human and chimp DNA is 14 times greater than the often-quoted 1 percent statistic.

It’s true that large portions of the human genome are still only about 1.5 percent genetically different from the chimp genome. We’ll explore what that means in a subsequent post. But the new data reveal just how little this one fact tells us about the overall picture. We now know that major portions of the two genomes — 12.5 percent to 13.3 percent of the human genome, in fact — are so different that arguably the sections are unalignable and/or not directly present in one genome or the other.

Burying the Lede

One very peculiar thing about the research just published is that nowhere in the technical paper is this bombshell discovery clearly reported, and nowhere is it stated clearly that human and chimp DNA is some ~14 percent different. Even an explainer article in Nature — which usually do a great job of translating technical findings for the average scientist — does not mention this huge finding. You have to dig deep into the Supplementary Data to find it, and even there it is opaquely stated in technical jargon.

This data has huge implications for the long-quoted statistic that we are only 1 percent genetically different from chimps, and many people are interested in this question for its implications regarding evolution, origins, and the exceptional status of human beings. Yet the papers almost seemed like they want to obscure the numbers, making them hard to find for the reader, whether a scientist or layman.

How hard would it have been for the original Nature paper or — even better — the explainer article to say that this new data shows that the human and chimp genomes are more like 14 percent to 15 percent different rather than 1 percent?

And yet for some very strange reason they did not do that. In journalism, this is called “burying the lede” — putting the main point of your reporting, the most notable fact, under a heap of less important verbiage. Sometimes this happens due to incompetence. Other times, it is deliberate.

Remembering the Icon

As Jonathan Wells taught us, “icons of evolution” are arguments for evolution that get recycled over and over again — yet are not true. How do we know the 1 percent statistic is such an icon? Science popularizer Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” provided a great example when he wrote in his 2014 book Undeniable:

As our understanding of DNA has increased, we have come to understand that we share around 98.8 percent of our gene sequence with chimpanzees. This is striking evidence for chimps and chumps to have a common ancestor. P. 248

The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History’s website likewise states:

DNA is thus especially important in the study of evolution. The amount of difference in DNA is a test of the difference between one species and another — and thus how closely or distantly related they are.

While the genetic difference between individual humans today is minuscule – about 0.1%, on average – study of the same aspects of the chimpanzee genome indicates a difference of about 1.2%.

Similar statements are found in the Smithsonian itself — the nation’s museum! — visited by nearly 4 million people yearly. I took this photo in 2023 when I visited:

A caption below declares that: “DNA evidence … confirms … that modern humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor…”

David Klinghoffer provides a nice rundown of other sources that have cited this statistic:

“We share more than 98 percent of our DNA and almost all of our genes with our closest living relative, the chimpanzee.” (Nature)

“[A]bout 99 percent of our DNA is identical to that of chimpanzees.” (Kevin Williamson, National Review)

“Most studies indicate that when genomic regions are compared between chimpanzees and humans, they share about 98.5 percent sequence identity.” (Scientific American)

“Humans and chimps share a surprising 98.8 percent of their DNA.” (American Museum of Natural History)

“[H]umans share about 99 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives.” (Science)

“Chimps, Humans 96 Percent the Same, Gene Study Finds.” (National Geographic News)

This “1 percent human-chimp genetic difference” statistic has been widely promoted and is widely believed. It’s undeniably an icon of evolution. But Dr. Wells also noted that these icons are like “zombies” — they don’t die easily. Instead, they keep being repeated, long after they’ve been refuted.

If that’s true, then don’t expect the 1 percent statistic to go away anytime soon. In fact, as I mentioned, the new Nature paper makes it very difficult to dig up the figures I’ve quoted here, so I suspect we’ll continue to see zombie numbers quoted, despite what the newly published data shows. I’ll explain all of that in more detail in a subsequent article. For the moment, suffice to say that the old 1 percent difference statistic is the latest icon of evolution to fall. May it rest in peace.",https://scienceandculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/seattle-fireworks-stockpack-adobe-stock-320771998-stockpack-adobestock-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 21:58:53.254066

TNC clusters support a hybrid cloud model allowing customers to deploy on premises, on bare metal servers, or in cloud. This document captures the details for deploying the TNC Management cluster in the Amazon Web Service (AWS) , as shown in the figure below:

The TNC Management cluster can be deployed on AWS by using the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), which is a fully managed service that provides Red Hat OpenShift clusters on AWS. It is jointly supported by Red Hat and AWS, with Red Hat operating the platform. Using ROSA to deploy the management cluster in the public cloud means that the same OpenShift platform is being used on-prem as well as in the public cloud, making it easier to have streamlined operations across the hybrid cloud. This also gives operators the flexibility to deploy the primary instance of the management cluster in the cloud, or deploy it on-premises and use the public cloud in case of disaster recovery scenarios.

TNC Management Cluster

The TNC Management (MGMT) cluster provides MANagement & Orchestration (MANO) capabilities to deploy the workload clusters (where 4G and 5G core or RAN components are deployed), to monitor them as well as to manage the life cycle of those clusters. The MGMT cluster is deployed on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform based cluster (either on-prem or in the public cloud) that will host the Red Hat provided tools to manage the remote workload clusters. 3rd party management tools can also be installed on the management cluster to augment the automation capabilities provided by the Red Hat tools or to manage the workloads being deployed across the network.

The figure below shows the different applications / tools that make up the MGMT cluster as its deployed on ROSA:

The goal is to start with a ROSA cluster and install the different applications / tools on that ROSA cluster such that it can deploy, monitor and manage / operate workload clusters across the hybrid estate. As shown in the figure above, the following products / components make up the MGMT cluster:

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM)

Provides the ability to deploy apps and control policies across multiple OpenShift clusters, permitting manageability of multiple environments at scale

RHACM, along with OpenShift GitOps and Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) operators, is being used to provide GitOps based Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) of the on-prem workload clusters

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)

Ansible Automation Platform helps to manage complex deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments. It will provide an entry point via an API for 3rd parties to interact with the environment

AAP on the MGMT cluster can be used to automate tasks for configuring the on-prem clusters

Red Hat Quay

Red Hat Quay is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images

Quay on the MGMT cluster is being used to provide the private container image repository for deploying the on-prem clusters in an air-gapped / disconnected environment

ACM Observability

RHACM can be used to aggregate the metrics / events from all the on-prem workload clusters and provide a single pane of glass for operators to monitor those clusters

Vault Secrets Operator (VSO)

VSO can be used to retrieve credentials from a vault server and provide those credentials for consumption by the different workloads running in OpenShift clusters. As GIT is being used to hold the cluster definitions and configurations for the GitOps based ZTP process, we do not want to publish credentials in the GIT repository. The VSO facilitates the GitOps process without requiring to store credentials in GIT

Vault Server

Optionally, the vault server can also be deployed on the TNC MGMT cluster. Regardless of whether the vault server is installed locally or installed external to the ROSA cluster, VSO can retrieve credentials from that vault server and create secrets in the local ROSA cluster

Storage

The different applications deployed on the MGMT cluster need persistent storage. The ROSA cluster uses AWS EBS to provide block storage to the cluster workloads. AWS S3 service is being used to provide object storage.

ROSA Cluster Design / Configuration

The sections below explain the ROSA design to host a TNC Management cluster for deploying, managing and monitoring on-premises, disconnected / air-gapped OpenShift clusters via GitOps based Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).

Hosted Control Plane Vs. Classic Architecture

The ROSA service can be setup in one of the following two architectures:

ROSA with Hosted control plane (HCP)

The control plane is hosted within a service account and managed by Red Hat with the worker nodes deployed in the customer’s AWS account.

ROSA Classic Architecture

The control plane and worker nodes are deployed in the customer’s AWS account and has support for the baremetal (metal3) operator

While the preference is for using ROSA with HCP for deploying the TNC MGMT cluster, ROSA on HCP currently does not support the baremetal (metal3) operator for OpenShift. The baremetal operator is required for the RHACM ZTP procedure and hence ROSA with HCP cannot be used for hosting the TNC MGMT cluster.

NOTE: Support for the baremetal operator on ROSA with HCP is expected to be available in the first half of 2026.

Public Vs. Private ROSA Cluster

A ROSA cluster can be deployed as a public cluster as shown in the figure below:

In this configuration the ROSA nodes can reach the internet via the NAT and internet gateways. Ingress traffic from the internet can also reach the ROSA cluster by using the external load balancers provided by ROSA for the API endpoint and application ingress routers.

While the public ROSA cluster provides protection against attacks by using security groups to filter ingress traffic, a private ROSA cluster breaks all ingress connectivity from the internet by dropping the external load balancers and replacing them with internal / private load balancers, as shown in the figure below:

With a private ROSA cluster, the ROSA nodes can still reach destinations on the internet via the NAT gateway, however ingress access to the OpenShift API and ingress routers is only available via the internal load balancers. The internal load balancers can be reached from within the VPC or by establishing VPC peering relationships or by adding VPN connections to the VPC.

Since the TNC workload (on-premises) clusters are designed as disconnected / air-gapped clusters, the ROSA cluster for hosting the TNC MGMT cluster is also being designed to use a private ROSA cluster. The figure below shows the TNC hybrid cloud design where an AWS site-to-site VPN is being used to connect the private ROSA cluster to on-premises OpenShift clusters:

This design adds a private S3 endpoint to the ROSA cluster and relies on DNS configuration to be added on both sides of the site-to-site VPN as explained below.

ROSA to On-Prem Connectivity

Several options are available to connect the ROSA cluster to the on-premises clusters. The AWS site-to-site VPN is selected in this design to achieve this connectivity. Both ends of the site-to-site VPN need to advertise appropriate routes to provide bidirectional connectivity:

Advertise on-prem subnets into the VPC route tables, with the AWS VPN gateway as next hop

Advertise the AWS VPC private subnets into the on-prem network with the on-prem customer gateway router as the next hop

This VPN will be used to carry the following traffic:

From ROSA to on-prem

Access to on-prem BMC IPs

Access to on-prem DNS server IP

Access to on-prem machineNet subnet(s)

From On-prem to ROSA

Access to ROSA machineNet

Access to ROSA private subnets

Custom Security Group

ROSA installation creates different security groups to allow OpenShift control plane and data plane traffic flow. However, These security groups that are created by default during ROSA installation do not include the ports that are used by RHACM to perform zero touch provisioning of on-prem OpenShift clusters. In order for RHACM ZTP to work, the following ports need to be opened up in the security groups that are being applied to the different ROSA nodes:

TCP 6385 – metal3-ironic-api

TCP 6183 – Mount virtual ISO

TCP 9999 – ironic-python-agent

As ROSA is a managed cluster, updates to the default security groups (that are created by the ROSA installer) are not allowed. Hence, a custom security group needs to be created prior to ROSA cluster installation, and provided as input to the ROSA installation command, so that it can be used to open the ZTP ports listed above.

The following sample shows the selection of the customer security group while passing the parameters to the interactive ROSA installation command:

? Additional ‘Compute’ Security Group IDs (optional): sg-0e5b0d0981d4adf80 (‘custom-sg-node’)

? Additional ‘Infra’ Security Group IDs (optional): sg-0e5b0d0981d4adf80 (‘custom-sg-node’)

? Additional ‘Control Plane’ Security Group IDs (optional): sg-0e5b0d0981d4adf80 (‘custom-sg-node’)

NOTE: The custom security group needs to be applied to the nodes during ROSA installation. Security groups cannot be applied to the nodes, post cluster installation.

Storage

The applications running on the ROSA cluster need access to persistent storage. Access to block storage is being provided by using the Amazon Elastic Block Service (EBS). During ROSA cluster installation appropriate CSI drivers are configured and storage classes created to provide access to EBS for creating Permanent Virtual Claims (PVCs) for persistent block storage.

There are two applications running in the TNC MGMT cluster that require access to object storage:

Red Hat Quay

Uses object storage to store the container images for the private registry

RHACM Observability

Aggregates metrics and events from the on-prem OpenShift clusters. Uses object storage to store the observability data

This design uses the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to provide object storage for the above mentioned applications. The following configuration needs to be added on top of the standard ROSA configuration to provide access to the S3 bucket for object storage:

Create an internal endpoint for S3 service, using private subnets

By default, the ROSA installer creates a gateway endpoint for S3. However, that gateway end point does not provide a DNS enabled endpoint.

Hence, we will create an interface endpoint for the S3 service and select the option to enable DNS record for that endpoint. The on-prem clusters can use this endpoint to reach the AWS S3 bucket

NOTE: The on-prem clusters access Quay in the TNC MGMT cluster to retrieve container images. By default Quay redirects the clients towards its storage backend, hence requiring the clients to directly communicate with the AWS S3 bucket

Create an S3 bucket

Create an IAM user with appropriate permissions to read / write S3 data

Create an access token for this user account

Use that access token to create secrets for OpenShift services / applications needing S3 access

DNS Configuration

Bidirectional communication between the MGMT (hub) cluster and the workload (spoke) clusters requires appropriate DNS resolution of the FQDNs associated with the ROSA cluster as well as with the on-prem workload clusters. This requires DNS configuration on both sides of the site-to-site VPN tunnel.

ROSA Side DNS Configuration

The services / applications in the ROSA cluster need to be able to resolve FQDN’s associated with on-prem clusters, for example, RHACM in the MGMT cluster needs to reach the API endpoint of the different on-prem workload clusters.

We will configure the CoreDNS services running in the ROSA cluster to use the on-prem DNS server as forwarder / upstream DNS server so that it can use the on-prem DNS server to resolve the FQDNs associated with the on-prem clusters. The following custom resource can be used to configure CoreDNS service on the ROSA cluster:

On-Prem Side DNS Configuration

The on-prem OpenShift clusters need to reach different services / endpoints in the ROSA cluster. The following DNS entries need to be created on the on-prem DNS server so that the FQDNs associated with the ROSA services can be resolved.

Access to ROSA Cluster API

Identify the IP address(es) associated with DNS record for the internal API load balancer for the ROSA cluster

Configure the on-prem DNS server to map all queries for ROSA api.<cluster-name>.domain to the IP address of internal API load balancer

Access to ROSA Cluster Applications

Identify the IP address(es) associated with DNS record for the internal Application load balancer for the ROSA cluster

Configure on-prem DNS server to map all queries for ROSA *.apps.<cluster-name>.domain to the IP address of the internal Application load balancer

Access to AWS S3

Identify the IP addresses associated with DNS record for the private S3 endpoint that was created earlier

Configure on-prem DNS server to map all requests for “s3.<region>.amazonaws.com” to the IP addresses of the private S3 endpoint

Conclusion

With the right configuration applied to the ROSA and on-premises environments, the TNC Management cluster can be securely deployed on AWS to manage the lifecycle of the on-prem TNC workload clusters. The figure below shows a managed cluster successfully deployed on-premises from the management cluster in ROSA, via ZTP. Once the on-premises cluster has been deployed, it can be monitored via the RHACM observability service. This hybrid cloud approach gives operators the flexibility to pick the appropriate environment for running their OpenShift clusters, either in the public cloud or on-premises.",https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/c097638f92de80ba8d6c696b26e6e601a5f61eb7/2025/12/31/Screenshot-2025-12-31-at-9.31.30 AM-1182x630.png,N,,2026-01-01 18:14:02.978111

(NYSE: PFE) finds itself in a position that would have been unthinkable during the height of the pandemic. Once the darling of the pharmaceutical world, the company’s stock ended 2025 at approximately $24.90, marking another year of trading well below the psychological $30 threshold. Despite a massive dividend yield approaching 7% and a series of aggressive multibillion-dollar acquisitions, the market remains skeptical of Pfizer’s ability to replace its dwindling COVID-19 revenue and navigate a looming ""patent cliff.""

The immediate implications for investors are stark: Pfizer has become a classic ""battleground"" stock. Value hunters point to a rock-bottom forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.6x and a sustainable dividend as signs of a generational buying opportunity. Conversely, skeptics argue that the company is a value trap, burdened by high debt from its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen and a pipeline that has seen as many high-profile failures as it has successes over the last 24 months.

A Year of ""Resets"" and Strategic Pivots

The road to Pfizer’s current sub-$30 valuation was paved with significant volatility throughout 2025. Following a disastrous 2024, management spent much of the past year attempting to ""reset"" investor expectations. In December 2025, Pfizer issued 2026 revenue guidance of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion, a range that reflects a $1.5 billion headwind from patent expirations and the continued erosion of Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. While the non-COVID portfolio grew by a respectable 4% operationally in late 2025, it has not yet been enough to offset the vacuum left by the pandemic products.

A key subplot of the past year was the intervention of activist investor Starboard Value LP. The hedge fund took a $1 billion stake in late 2024, pressuring CEO Albert Bourla to accelerate cost-cutting measures and improve R&D productivity. While Starboard failed to secure board seats and eventually exited its position in November 2025, its influence was felt. Pfizer successfully implemented a massive cost-realization program, targeting $7.2 billion in net savings by 2027. This austerity, combined with a narrowed earnings guidance of $3.00 to $3.15 per share for the end of 2025, has helped stabilize the bottom line even as the stock price remains depressed.

The most dramatic shift occurred in Pfizer’s obesity strategy. After the high-profile failure of its once-daily oral drug danuglipron in April 2025 due to safety concerns, Pfizer pivoted aggressively. In November 2025, the company spent approximately $7 billion to acquire Metsera, a move that brought a new suite of GLP-1 candidates into the fold. This acquisition was seen as a ""Hail Mary"" to remain relevant in a weight-loss market currently dominated by rivals.

The Winners and Losers of the New Pharma Landscape

In the current market environment, the clear winners have been Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO). These two titans have effectively cornered the obesity and diabetes market with their respective blockbusters, Zepbound and Wegovy. Pfizer’s struggle to break into this space has resulted in a massive valuation gap; while Lilly trades at premium multiples, Pfizer has been relegated to the bargain bin. However, if Pfizer’s new Metsera-derived candidates, such as the injectable MET-097i, show strong Phase 3 data in 2026, Pfizer could emerge as a ""comeback kid"" winner, offering a cheaper entry point into the obesity gold rush.

On the losing side of this transition are the legacy COVID-19 manufacturers, including Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA), which has faced similar struggles in diversifying its revenue stream beyond mRNA vaccines. Within Pfizer’s own portfolio, the ""losers"" are the shareholders who bought in at the 2021 highs. The stock’s technical setup at the start of 2026 is decidedly bearish, with shares trading below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Technical analysts point to a ""floor"" at $23.88, but warn that without a breakout above $27.00, the stock remains in a persistent downtrend.

Shifting Focus: Oncology and the Patent Cliff

Pfizer’s current predicament fits into a broader industry trend known as the ""Patent Cliff."" Like its peers Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), Pfizer is facing the loss of exclusivity for several multi-billion dollar drugs, including Eliquis and Ibrance, over the next few years. To combat this, Pfizer has staked its future on oncology. The integration of Seagen has been a bright spot, with the bladder cancer drug Padcev exceeding sales expectations in 2025. Pfizer expects its oncology division to contribute $10 billion in incremental revenue by 2030, a goal that is essential for the company to return to growth.

Historically, pharmaceutical giants have used ""M&A binges"" to bridge the gap between patent expirations. Pfizer’s recent $43 billion spend on Seagen and $7 billion on Metsera follows this precedent, but it has left the company with a significant debt load. This has forced management to pause share buybacks to prioritize debt reduction and dividend payments. The market is currently punishing Pfizer for this leverage, comparing it unfavorably to more ""capital-light"" biotech firms that are seeing higher R&D efficiency.

What Lies Ahead: The 2026 Outlook

Looking forward, the short-term trajectory for Pfizer will be dictated by its February 2026 earnings report and the initial clinical readouts from the Metsera pipeline. If the company can prove that its new obesity candidates are competitive in terms of efficacy and side-effect profiles, it could trigger a massive short-covering rally. Conversely, any further delays in the oncology pipeline or a dividend cut—though management insists the payout is safe—would likely send the stock tumbling toward the $20 mark.

The long-term scenario depends on Pfizer’s ability to transform from a ""vaccine company"" back into a diversified ""specialty medicine"" powerhouse. Investors should watch for potential strategic pivots, such as the divestiture of non-core consumer health assets or a further narrowing of the R&D focus. The company needs to demonstrate that it can grow its non-COVID revenue at a double-digit clip to regain the market's trust.

Final Assessment: Value or Trap?

As of January 2026, Pfizer is the ultimate test of a value investor's patience. The 7% dividend yield provides a significant ""margin of safety"" for those willing to wait for a turnaround, and the current payout ratio of 56-58% of adjusted earnings suggests the dividend is more sustainable than the headline GAAP numbers imply. However, the lack of immediate growth catalysts and the technical weakness of the stock suggest that the ""trap"" remains set for those expecting a quick recovery.

Moving forward, the market will be laser-focused on three things: the debt-to-equity ratio as Pfizer pays down its M&A loans, the Phase 3 progress of the Metsera obesity assets, and the continued commercial success of the Seagen oncology portfolio. For now, Pfizer remains a high-yield utility-like play in a high-growth sector—a paradox that will only be resolved when the company proves it can innovate its way out of the COVID shadow.

MARKET DYNAMICS

MARKET DRIVERS

Growing Burden of Complex Surgeries and Shift to Minimally Invasive Care Boost Market Growth

The global surgical imaging market growth is primarily driven by the rising volume of surgical procedures such as orthopedic, spine, neuro, and cardiovascular. Moreover, rising shift toward minimally invasive techniques that require precise intraoperative guidance is also projected to accelerate market growth. Surgeons increasingly rely on real-time fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT to confirm implant placement, reduce revisions and shorten hospital stays.

For instance, according to data published by the NCBI in August 2024, the proportion of colorectal minimally invasive surgeries in Germany increased from 26.2% in 2019 to 43.7% in 2023.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Cautious Adoption of Implant-Based POP Repair Techniques May Deter Market Growth

A key restraint for the surgical imaging market is the high upfront cost of advanced C-arms, hybrid OR imaging systems, and associated infrastructure. Many mid-size hospitals and outpatient centers continue to extend the life of legacy image-intensifier C-arms or purchase refurbished mini-C-arms rather than invest in premium flat-panel or robotic systems. In addition, companies such as Mini C Arm LLC, which refurbishes systems from leading brands and offers them to clinics and surgery centers, illustrate how cost pressure fuels a sizeable secondary market. This dynamic can delay replacement cycles and slow penetration of cutting-edge 3D and motorized systems, particularly in cost-sensitive regions.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Growing Demand for AI-based and Patient Centric Systems to Provide Lucrative Growth Opportunities

The demand for advanced and intelligent tools is rising. As these systems enable workflow automation along with comprehensive analysis, the demand for such technologies is extensively rising. Moreover, healthcare facilities are seeking systems that not only capture images but also guide positioning, standardize protocols, integrate with navigation or robotics and support data-driven decision making. In addition, such systems play a prominent role in streamlining the overall operations along with multiple functionalities.

In December 2025, GE HealthCare in collaboration with Mayo Clinic announced launch of GEMINI-RT, specifically designed for advanced cancer care.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Operational Complexity, Staffing Gaps and Integration Barriers to Pose Challenge for Market Growth

Despite strong innovation, providers face challenges around staffing, training and IT/OR integration. Advanced C-arms require skilled radiographers or OR staff to manage positioning, dose settings and 3D acquisitions, which can be difficult in environments already affected by workforce shortages.

SURGICAL IMAGING MARKET TRENDS

Rapid Transition from Legacy to Flat-panel, Motorized, and 3D Systems

A notable trend in the surgical imaging market is the transition from conventional image intensifier C-arms to flat-panel detector platforms, motorized C-arms and 3D/CBCT systems that enhance intraoperative control. Moreover, market players are launching compact systems with larger flat-panel detectors, as observed in Ziehm Imaging’s IGZO flat-panel technology. Simultaneously, advanced systems such as GE HealthCare’s OEC 3D and Siemens’ CIARTIC Move bring 3D volumes and automated positioning to routine spine and trauma workflows.

So is McCormick & Company actually worth your money, or just another cozy brand your parents love while you chase the next meme coin?

Let’s run it like your FYP: hype, receipts, rivals, and whether this ticker deserves a spot in your portfolio.

The Hype is Real: McCormick & Company on TikTok and Beyond

McCormick isn’t some random corporate logo in a suit. It owns the flavor in half the stuff already in your pantry: spices, sauces, hot takes like Frank’s RedHot, Old Bay, and all those “secret ingredients” food creators flex in their reels.

FoodTok and recipe YouTube love McCormick because it hits the sweet spot: cheap, easy, and super visible on camera. That’s free marketing on loop.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch viral TikTok reviews of McCormick & Company

Watch honest tests on YouTube

Creators love calling out the brand on spice hauls, kitchen glow-ups, and “I finally learned to cook” arcs. That social clout feeds straight back into grocery carts – and, long term, into earnings.

The Business Side: McCormick Aktie

Time to talk money, not just marinades.

Stock: McCormick & Company, Incorporated (often just “McCormick”)

ISIN: US5797802064

Ticker (US): MKC

Listing: US market

Real talk on data: Live market data for McCormick’s stock cannot be pulled directly here. That means no guessing, no made?up prices. You need to check the latest quote yourself on a real-time source like Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, or your brokerage app. Look for ticker MKC and confirm under ISIN US5797802064.

Here’s how to sanity-check the price action quickly:

Search “MKC stock” on at least two platforms (for example, Yahoo Finance and Google Finance).

Compare the last close, the day’s percent change, and the 52-week range.

If markets are closed when you look, you’ll only see the last close and maybe some after-hours data.

What matters for you isn’t the exact dollar amount right this second, but the pattern: is MKC grinding higher over time, stuck in a sideways chop, or cooling off after a big run? That’s your price-performance story.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Strip away the cozy branding and this is what you’re really buying into.

1. Boring… in a good way (defensive food play)

People might skip a new phone. They do not skip salt, pepper, hot sauce, and taco seasoning. McCormick sells products that survive recessions, layoffs, and vibes-only budgets. That makes it a defensive stock: not flashy, but more stable than a lot of hype names.

If you want a core holding that doesn’t implode every time the Fed sneezes, this kind of business can be a quiet backbone in your portfolio.

2. Dividend drip, not lottery ticket

McCormick has a long history of paying dividends. That means it sends cash back to shareholders regularly. For long-term investors, that’s a built-in “thank you” just for holding.

Is it a “get rich this month” move? No. But if you’re stacking for the long run, a dividend payer that touches almost every grocery cart in the country can be a solid “set it and chill” play.

3. Pricing power and brand obsession

McCormick can raise prices on spices and seasonings more easily than a lot of other food products. Why? Because when a home cook or a restaurant trusts a flavor profile, they don’t want to risk a downgrade to a generic brand that tastes off.

That pricing power is huge. It helps offset inflation and supply chain costs, so margins do not get completely wrecked when everything else gets more expensive.

So, is it a game-changer or a total flop for you? If you want crazy-fast gains, this will feel slow. If you want long-term resilience, it looks a lot closer to a must-have.

McCormick & Company vs. The Competition

Who’s really fighting McCormick for space in your pantry and your portfolio?

Main rivals:

General Mills (GIS) – Big food player with cereals, snacks, and meal kits.

Kraft Heinz (KHC) – Sauces, condiments, and packaged foods powerhouse.

Store brands – Grocery chains’ private label spices and seasonings.

Clout war: who wins?

Social presence: McCormick quietly wins here. General Mills and Kraft Heinz have recognizable brands, but McCormick owns the subtle “I just cooked something amazing” moments creators love to share. The label shows up constantly in recipe content without screaming.

Focus: McCormick is locked into flavor – spices, blends, sauces. Rivals are more scattered across cereals, frozen foods, and processed snacks. That focus gives McCormick a stronger identity in the “cook at home” trend.

Everyday relevance: You might not eat cereal every day. You use salt, seasoning, and sauce in almost anything that hits a pan. That frequency matters over time.

If this were purely a clout contest, McCormick isn’t the loudest brand, but it’s the one that shows up in the most actual meals. Quiet dominance usually ages better than loud novelty.

Is It Worth the Hype? Real Talk on Price-Performance

Here’s how to decide if MKC is a no-brainer or a hard pass when you see the live price:

If the stock is trading near the low end of its 52-week range and the business is still pumping out steady sales and dividends, that’s “price drop = potential opportunity” territory.

If it’s near record highs after a big rally, you might be paying full hype pricing. Still fine long term, but don’t expect instant fireworks.

If earnings are stable or slowly growing while the price has been dragging, that disconnect can be your chance to sneak in before the next wave of boring-but-profitable buyers.

Use your finance app or broker to check live performance. Compare McCormick’s chart with another food name like General Mills or Kraft Heinz over the last few years. If MKC looks smoother and more resilient, that’s your signal: less drama, more durability.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, is McCormick & Company a viral must-have for your portfolio or just comfort food for boomers?

If you want a meme rocket: This is probably a drop. McCormick is not trying to 10x in a week. It is not a “watch this flip overnight” stock.

If you want a core, stable, grown-up play: This is much closer to a cop. Defensive food exposure, global brand recognition, solid dividend history, and real-world demand that does not rely on hype cycles to survive.

Call it what it is: a long-term, low-drama, real-world business that most of your friends are already funding every time they buy taco seasoning, buffalo sauce, or steak rub.

Check MKC’s latest stock price on a live platform, compare it against its 52-week range and dividends, and decide if this “spice king” earns a permanent spot in your watchlist – or your portfolio.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404982_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 12:59:08.445572

This year, states are enacting a slew of laws focused on wages, social media rules, restrictions on gender-affirming care, AI regulation and much more.

Here is a sampling of some of those changes, as reported by public media journalists across the country.

California rideshare drivers can unionize

Under a new law, California's 800,000 rideshare drivers have the right to unionize starting on Jan. 1. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom brokered the deal between organized labor and major rideshare companies, including Uber and Lyft.

The rideshare giants supported the expansion of collective bargaining rights to their drivers in exchange for lawmakers agreeing to slash the companies' insurance costs for underinsured drivers.

After Massachusetts voters decided to do so in 2024, California became the second state to extend collective bargaining rights to rideshare drivers.

More paid time off in Colorado for parents of babies in the NICU

Colorado families whose babies spend time in the NICU will be able to take more paid leave this year. Colorado's paid family leave program already allows workers to take up to 12 weeks off from work to care for a new baby, or for a serious family health or personal issue, and receive most of their pay during that time.

Now, families whose babies require time in neonatal intensive care can apply for an additional 12 weeks of paid leave. Backers say this acknowledges the extra strain families are under when caring for preemies and other newborns with significant health problems.

Democratic State Sen. Jeff Bridges was one of the main sponsors and says he was inspired by his own personal experience. His newborn was in intensive care, which he says was ""terrifying and consuming.""

Democrats passed the bill, mostly along party lines. Opponents say they worry about increased costs to businesses and workers who pay into the program.

Illinois also has a new NICU law going into effect in June, but unlike Colorado, the time off is not required to be paid.

Social media time limits in Virginia

A new law in Virginia, which faces a legal challenge, is designed to limit social media use by those under 16 to one hour a day, unless a parent agrees to a longer period. NetChoice, a group representing social media services, claims the law violates the First Amendment. The law's author, Democratic State Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, argues it's a ""reasonable attempt to balance free speech with the safety and privacy of our children.""

In legal filings, attorneys for NetChoice call the law the ""latest attempt in a long line of government efforts to restrict new forms of constitutionally protected expression based on concerns about their potential effects on minors."" A preliminary injunction hearing is set for mid-January.

Eighteen states restrict SNAP money for candy, sodas

With permission from the Trump administration, 18 states will ban the purchase of candy, sodas, energy drinks or other items using federal dollars intended for low-income households.

The states, which include South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas, received waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2025 that will allow them to restrict Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollars for items the states deem non-nutritious.

Citing adult and child obesity statistics, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said in December that the waiver will help create healthier outcomes and said the goal aligns with President Trump's push to restore SNAP to its ""true purpose – nutrition.""

South Carolina will ban the purchase of candy, energy drinks, soft drinks, and other sweetened beverages using SNAP dollars.

Other states have narrower limits. Texas will prohibit SNAP funds for sweetened drinks and candy, and Virginia plans to bar SNAP dollars for certain ""sweetened beverages."" All 18 states have a target implementation date of sometime this year.

Among other things, critics of the waivers say they are skeptical the bans will improve people's health.

Paid leave up to 20 weeks in Minnesota

Beginning this week, most Minnesota workers will have access to paid family and medical leave benefits. The state is launching a program that allows 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick loved one or bond with a baby, as well as 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from illness or injury.

There's a cap of 20 weeks in a year if someone taps both. Those who take paid leave will receive partial pay and will have a guarantee that their position at work will be there when they return. Employers are also barred from retaliating against workers who take the paid time off.

The program is funded through a payroll tax split between employers and employees.

Some business groups tried to block the legislation, saying that if employees take significant time off, it could put more work on others.

Roughly three-quarters of Minnesota workers are expected to receive more paid leave benefits under the program than they had previously. Minnesota will be among 13 states to offer paid family and medical leave benefits.

Illinois regulates AI, despite Trump's executive order

Starting this year, employers in Illinois are prohibited from using artificial intelligence in employment decisions – from making new hires to promoting or disciplining current employees – if the technology factors in demographic information, such as the person's race or ZIP code.

It's an amendment to the state's Human Rights Act and was passed by the legislature's Democratic supermajority. Democratic State Sen. Javier Cervantes sponsored the measure. As an artist, Cervantes says he has real concerns about how rapidly AI has progressed over the past few years.

The much-discussed Series D was never closed, never formally announced, and never reflected in the company’s capital structure.
The revelation comes as Nvidia is now in advanced talks to acquire AI21.
Google and Nvidia first invested in AI21 during the 2023 round, which was later expanded during the war in Israel.
Even so, estimates suggest annual revenue of roughly $50 million, a figure that has not meaningfully changed since 2023.","For much of 2025, AI21 Labs was widely described as having pulled off one of Israel’s largest artificial-intelligence fundraisings: a $300 million Series D backed by Google and Nvidia. The round was cited as evidence that the company, one of the country’s few builders of a large-scale language model, had secured its place among the industry’s serious contenders.

It now turns out that the round was never completed. In fact, AI21’s last actual fundraising took place in November 2023, when the company extended its Series C to a total of $208 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion. The much-discussed Series D was never closed, never formally announced, and never reflected in the company’s capital structure.

The revelation comes as Nvidia is now in advanced talks to acquire AI21. Estimates suggest a potential deal value of $2-3 billion, above the company’s last known valuation but far below the sums commanded by the sector’s global leaders. If completed, the transaction would appear to be driven less by technology than by people.

AI21 currently employs around 200 people, down from the 260 it reported in 2023. A plan to recruit an additional 100 employees in 2024 never materialized. Nvidia’s interest is widely understood to center on the company’s workforce, highly trained AI researchers, many with advanced academic credentials, rather than on a breakout commercial product.

Such an outcome would mark a quiet retreat from AI21’s original ambition. Founded in 2017 by Professor Amnon Shashua, Professor Yoav Shoham, and Ori Goshen, the company was conceived as a flagship Israeli effort to compete at the frontier of artificial intelligence, years before the generative AI boom that reshaped the industry after 2022. Shoham and Goshen serve as co-CEOs, with Shashua as chairman.

Google and Nvidia first invested in AI21 during the 2023 round, which was later expanded during the war in Israel. Over the past two years, however, the company has struggled to keep pace with the accelerating advances of rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic. In April, AI21 halted development of Wordtune, its long-running consumer-facing product, narrowing its focus to enterprise customers where accuracy and reliability matter more than scale or experimentation.

Today, AI21’s business centers on specialized language models for corporate use. Its flagship product, Maestro, is designed to improve model accuracy by up to 50%, and the company has recently introduced a new reasoning model that it says is faster and more memory-efficient than competing systems. Even so, estimates suggest annual revenue of roughly $50 million, a figure that has not meaningfully changed since 2023.",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2023/04/23/SJ11iJ2MQ3/SJ11iJ2MQ3_0_252_2000_1126_0_large.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:00:38.019545

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia purchased Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) shares worth $5 billion. The share price went up by around 2% after the announcement. According to the report, this move is based on Nvidia’s previous announcement in September, where the company announced that it would buy Intel’s share at $23.28 per share to support its finances to enhance production capacity.

On December 29, Nvidia bought 214.7 million shares of Intel at the price that was established in the September agreement. As per Reuters, the antitrust agency of the United States approved this investment.

That said, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained more than 61% over the past 6 months. However, Wall Street remains cautious with analysts’ 12-month price target reflecting around 7% upside from the current levels. Recently, on December 19, William Stein from Truist Financial reiterated a Hold rating on the stock, with a $39 price target. Earlier on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities raised the firm’s price target from $34 to $40, while maintaining a Sell rating.

Analyst Arya of BofA noted that he improved the price target based on the growing opportunity for the company’s foundry. BofA expects Intel to secure external wins in advanced packaging and wafer design. However, the analyst cautioned that the uncertainties in the manufacturing sector continue to distort the outlook, hence the firm maintained a Sell rating.

A New, Urgent Production Push

According to an exclusive Reuters report, Nvidia has approached its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), to dramatically increase the output of the H200 AI chips in response to surging demand from Chinese technology companies. Sources say that these firms have placed orders exceeding 2 million H200 units for delivery in 2026, but with Nvidia’s current inventory standing at approximately 700,000 chips, it created a significant shortfall that prompted the outreach to Taiwan Semiconductor.

The H200 is based on Nvidia’s Hopper architecture and produced using Taiwan Semiconductor’s 4-nanometer process. As the second most powerful chip in its portfolio, one that is vastly superior for training complex models than the dumbed down versions Nvidia made to comply with U.S. export restrictions, it also indicates Chinese companies view it as a better option than other regional or locally produced chips.

Nvidia has requested that Taiwan Semiconductor begin fabricating additional chips, with production slated to commence in the second quarter of 2026. While the precise volume of the new order remains undisclosed, this step aims to address the gap between Nvidia’s existing inventory and the incoming orders, giving the chipmaker time to ramp up to meet the demand.

With the initial shipments fulfilled from its current stock, the first deliveries could potentially arrive before the Lunar New Year in mid-February 2026. This timeline builds on earlier reports the Trump administration authorized the shipment of H200 sales to China again.

Pricing for the China-specific H200 variants has been set at around $27,000 per chip, according to the sources, positioning them as a viable option for Chinese buyers seeking high-performance AI hardware amid limited alternatives.

Balancing Global Supply Amid Strategic Shifts

This production ramp-up occurs as Nvidia shifts its attention toward its newer Blackwell series and the forthcoming Rubin chips, which are expected to drive future growth. The emphasis on H200 expansion, however, highlights China’s continued role as a major market, even as trade barriers have previously reduced Nvidia’s presence there.

A Nvidia spokesperson stated that the company manages its supply chain on an ongoing basis. They added, “Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” Yet the shipments could strain global AI chip availability, as Nvidia must allocate resources across regions while meeting heightened Chinese demand. Taiwan Semiconductor declined to comment on the matter, and China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to Reuters inquiries.

Key Takeaway

Investors shouldn’t get too hopeful just yet. The Reuters report relies on anonymous sources and lacks official confirmation from Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, or Chinese regulators, and Beijing has not approved any H200 imports.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/China-AI-Chip.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:00:43.064218

Besonders spannend: Während du auf TikTok neue L'Oréal-Produkte speicherst, schauen Investorinnen und Anleger auf die Loreal Aktie. Beauty im Bad, Börse im Hintergrund – und beides kann für dich richtig interessant werden.

Das Netz dreht durch: L'Oréal S.A. auf TikTok & Co.

Scroll mal durch deine For-You-Page: Gefühlt jede Woche ist irgendein L'Oréal-Produkt ein neuer viraler Hit. Foundation, die wie ein Filter aussieht. Mascara, die angeblich falsche Wimpern ersetzt. Haarpflege, die ""alles rettet"".

Die Stimmung im Netz: Eine Mischung aus Hype, ""Muss ich testen!"" und natürlich auch Skepsis. Unter den Videos häufen sich Kommentare wie ""Okay, aber lohnt sich das wirklich?"" und ""Brauche echte Erfahrungen, nicht nur Werbung"". Gleichzeitig gehen Before/After-Clips mit Millionen Views durch die Decke.

Auf Reddit, Insta und TikTok sieht man drei Trends:

Hype & FOMO: User posten ihre Erfahrung mit viralen L'Oréal-Produkten – viele feiern das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis im Vergleich zu Luxusmarken.

Angst vor Fail: Einige warnen: ""Achtung, auf meiner Haut hat das gar nicht funktioniert"" – vor allem bei sensibler Haut oder falschem Farbton.

Memes: Clips à la ""Ich: Kauf nix mehr. Auch ich nach 3 TikToks: *L'Oréal-Haul*"" – der Effekt: Impulskäufe ohne Ende.

Willst du sehen, was die Leute sagen? Hier geht's zu den echten Meinungen:

??Die viralsten TikToks zu L'Oréal S.A. ansehen

??Ausführliche Tests auf YouTube checken

Top oder Flop? Das kann das neue Modell

Klar, L'Oréal ist keine einzelne Mascara oder ein einzelnes Serum – aber jedes Jahr kommen neue Must-have-Produkte hinzu, die online komplett eskalieren. Drei Dinge stechen immer wieder raus:

1. Preis-Hammer im Drogerie-Regal

L'Oréal positioniert viele Hits im mittleren Preissegment: teurer als absolute Billigmarken, aber deutlich günstiger als Luxuslabels. Für viele ist das die perfekte Zone: ""Fühlt sich High-End an, aber zerstört mein Konto nicht"". Genau hier entsteht der Preis-Hammer-Effekt – vor allem, wenn Creator L'Oréal als ""Dupe"" zu teuren Marken hypen.

2. Performance, die TikTok-tauglich ist

Produkte, die sichtbar etwas machen – mehr Glow, mehr Volumen, stärkere Deckkraft – performen online natürlich besser. Viele L'Oréal-Produkte liefern sofortige Before/After-Effekte, die man in einem 10-Sekunden-Clip sieht. Das pusht den Hype, weil User direkt sagen: ""Okay, das will ich testen"".

3. Riesige Auswahl – von Basic bis Pro-Look

Make-up, Hautpflege, Haarfarbe, Styling: L'Oréal bedient alles. Das heißt für dich: Du findest für fast jeden Look ein passendes Produkt – vom Alltags-Make-up bis zum Insta-Ready-Full-Face. Nachteil: Die Auswahl kann auch überfordern, und ohne guten Test oder ehrliche Review greifst du schnell daneben.

Achtung: Nur weil etwas viral ist, passt es nicht automatisch zu deinem Hauttyp oder Haar. Die besten Erfahrungen machen User, die vorher auf Inhaltsstoffe und Hautbedürfnisse achten – und nicht nur auf den Trend.

L'Oréal S.A. vs. Die Konkurrenz

Wer ist der größte Gegner im Beauty-Game? Ganz klar: Estée Lauder mit Marken wie MAC, Clinique oder The Ordinary. Beide Konzerne sind globale Riesen – aber sie spielen das Game unterschiedlich.

L'Oréal S.A.: Stark in der Breite, überall präsent – Drogerie, Online, Parfümerie. Viele Untermarken (z. B. Maybelline, NYX, Garnier), extrem aggressiv auf Social Media, viel Kooperation mit Creatorinnen und Influencern.

Estée Lauder: Mehr Fokus auf Premium- und Luxussegment, starke Präsenz in Parfümerien und High-End-Stores, oft teurer, dafür mit Luxus-Image.

Für die TikTok-Generation hat aktuell L'Oréal klar die Nase vorn. Warum? Weil die Brand es besser schafft, massentaugliche Produkte in virale Momente zu verwandeln. Wenn es um pure Reichweite, Verfügbarkeit und Social-Media-Hype geht, ist L'Oréal im Moment der Gewinner.

Wenn du allerdings auf superminimalistische Formulierungen, Nischenbrands oder cleane Indie-Marken stehst, wirken beide Beauty-Giganten für dich vielleicht eher wie die ""Boomer"" der Kosmetik-Welt.

Fazit: Kaufen oder sein lassen?

Also: Lohnt sich das? Aus User-Sicht sind L'Oréal-Produkte oft ein guter Mix aus Preis und Performance. Viele berichten von soliden Ergebnissen, besonders bei Make-up und Haarpflege. Für den Alltag okay bis richtig gut – mit ein paar echten Banger-Produkten dazwischen.

Aber: Blind alles kaufen, was viral ist, ist keine gute Idee. Gerade bei Hautpflege lohnt sich ein Blick in Inhaltsstoffe und echte Erfahrungsberichte. ""Eine Creatorin hat's empfohlen"" ist kein Hautarzt.

Wenn du:

ein günstigeres Dupe zu teurer High-End-Kosmetik suchst,

auf Social Media Produktempfehlungen stehst, aber bereit bist, sie kritisch zu hinterfragen,

und einfach Bock auf neue Looks hast, ohne Luxuspreise zu zahlen,

dann kann sich L'Oréal für dich definitiv lohnen. Tipp: Schau dir vor dem Kauf mindestens ein bis zwei unabhängige Tests auf YouTube an und check die Kommentare – da siehst du schnell, ob der Hype echt ist oder ein Fail droht.

Hinter den Kulissen: Loreal Aktie

Spannend für alle, die nicht nur Beauty im Bad, sondern auch Geld an der Börse haben wollen: Hinter den viralen Produkten steckt ein Börsenriese. Die Loreal Aktie mit der ISIN FR0000120321 wird an der Euronext Paris gehandelt und zählt zu den großen europäischen Konsumwerten.

Wichtiger Hinweis zum Kurs: Die folgenden Angaben basieren auf öffentlichen Finanzportalen. Aktuelle Kurse können sich jederzeit ändern, du solltest vor einer Entscheidung immer selbst nachschauen.

Zum zuletzt verfügbaren Handelsstand lag die Loreal Aktie bei rund Last Close: ca. 440–450 Euro je Aktie (Angabe gerundet, basierend auf gängigen Finanzseiten, bezogen auf den letzten offiziellen Handelsschluss). Der Kurs hat sich in den vergangenen Monaten insgesamt stabil bis leicht positiv entwickelt, mit typischen Schwankungen, wie sie bei großen Konsum- und Luxuswerten normal sind.

Warum ist das spannend? Weil der Markt L'Oréal als relativ robusten Konzern sieht: starke Marken, weltweite Präsenz, ständig neue Trends – und eben diese viralen Hits, die du auf TikTok siehst, können langfristig auch den Umsatz pushen. Heißt aber nicht automatisch, dass die Aktie ""nur steigen"" kann. Auch hier gilt: Achtung, keine Kaufempfehlung – informier dich immer selbst, check aktuelle Kurse und im Zweifel professionelle Beratung.

According to the petition, OpenAI relied on these reports mechanically, without independent assessment or notice to IndiaMART.
In its petition, IndiaMART compared its role to that of advertising media.
If AI platforms shape market visibility without transparency, they exercise economic power outside traditional regulatory oversight.
The court will examine whether AI platforms must explain exclusions that affect market access, or whether automated systems can continue to operate without clear accountability.","India’s largest B2B marketplace, IndiaMART InterMESH Limited, has taken OpenAI to the Calcutta High Court, alleging that ChatGPT selectively excluded the platform from AI-generated responses while mentioning rival marketplaces. What began as a dispute over search visibility has grown into a wider legal examination of how artificial intelligence shapes commercial outcomes, market access, and reputational standing in the digital economy.

The matter came up before Justice Ravi Krishna Kapur, who refused to grant immediate relief but made a sharp prima facie observation that IndiaMART appeared to be excluded “without any logic”. The court recognised that such exclusion can cause loss of goodwill, reputation, and commercial injury. The case now moves toward a detailed hearing scheduled for January 13, 2026.

Why This Case Matters Beyond IndiaMART

This dispute does not turn on whether ChatGPT should promote one marketplace over another. It raises a deeper question. Can an AI system, acting as a discovery layer for commercial information, decide which businesses users see without explaining how those decisions are made?

The Calcutta High Court’s early observation matters because it treats omission by an AI interface as a real market action. The court did not see AI outputs as neutral technical artefacts. Instead, it acknowledged that silence in AI-generated responses can shape perception, divert business, and distort competition.

What IndiaMART Told the Court

IndiaMART alleged that ChatGPT “specifically and consciously” chose to exclude the platform from responses where comparable B2B marketplaces were referenced. According to the petition, this was not a random error. The company claimed that OpenAI relied mechanically on reports issued by the United States Trade Representative (USTR), without any independent evaluation or opportunity of hearing.

The USTR is a US government agency that develops and enforces American trade policy. Its annual reports assess global trade and intellectual property practices from a US perspective. These reports influence policy debates but do not carry legal force outside the United States.

IndiaMART approached the court seeking a declaration that USTR findings were not binding on ChatGPT and could not form the basis for excluding its website and listings from AI-generated responses.

The High Court’s Initial View

While declining ad-interim relief, the court recorded a clear prima facie concern about selective discrimination.

“It prima facie appears that the petitioner is being selectively discriminated against and justifiably excluded without any logic. Inevitably, there is a loss of goodwill, reputation, and commercial injury, which is being caused to the petitioner,”

The High Court reasoned that granting immediate directions to alter ChatGPT outputs would amount to final relief without hearing OpenAI and other respondents. At the same time, it acknowledged that suppressed visibility on AI interfaces could cause continuing commercial harm.

What IndiaMART Is Asking For

At the interim stage, IndiaMART asked the court to restrain OpenAI from blacklisting or excluding its website, mobile application, and live product listings from ChatGPT-generated outputs. It also sought directions preventing OpenAI from relying on USTR reviews as a basis for excluding Indian businesses.

The petition further asked the court to direct removal of any internal filters or safeguards that suppress IndiaMART’s listings, along with ancillary reliefs, including costs.

IndiaMART framed its case around the idea that omission by an AI system can mislead users when that system functions as a primary source of commercial discovery. According to the petition, excluding IndiaMART while surfacing rival platforms presents a distorted picture of the B2B marketplace.

The company argued that this amounts to passing off through adverse commercial association. It also alleged trade libel and injurious falsehood, contending that silence by omission can operate as implied disparagement when users rely on AI-generated responses to make commercial decisions.

IndiaMART further claimed unfair competition. Distorted AI-driven visibility, it argued, can redirect users and enquiries toward competitors without any transparent or objective basis. Such harm, the company said, cannot be cured through monetary compensation alone.

The USTR Issue at the Core of the Dispute

A central factual issue concerns OpenAI’s alleged reliance on USTR reviews. IndiaMART argued that these reviews do not constitute binding legal determinations and carry no enforceable authority in India.

According to the petition, OpenAI relied on these reports mechanically, without independent assessment or notice to IndiaMART. The company also alleged selective application. Other platforms named in USTR reports for counterfeiting or piracy continue to appear in ChatGPT responses.

IndiaMART pointed out that it does not feature on the European Union’s Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List. It also relied on an Indian Government press release stating that India is under no obligation to act on USTR findings. On this basis, the company argued that OpenAI imported foreign policy judgments into Indian commercial space through code.

IndiaMART operates a B2B marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, with a strong focus on small and medium enterprises. Through its website and mobile application, suppliers list products and services, while buyers search, compare, and engage.

In its petition, IndiaMART compared its role to that of advertising media. Visibility, it argued, determines whether suppliers receive enquiries and whether buyers discover competing offerings.

To show scale and impact, IndiaMART stated that as of September 30, 2025, it had around 42 million registered buyers, over 124 million listed products, and more than 8.3 million registered suppliers. During the 2024–25 financial year, the platform generated about 458 million business enquiries.

Against this backdrop, exclusion from AI-generated responses was framed as a direct hit to market access.

Brand Dilution and Trademark Protection

IndiaMART also relied on the legal status of its brand. Its mark has been declared a well-known trademark under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. This status attracts enhanced protection against dilution and unfair commercial association.

According to the petition, exclusion from AI outputs dilutes goodwill attached to the mark and amounts to implied disparagement by omission. When an AI system highlights competing platforms while remaining silent about a well-known marketplace, it sends a misleading signal about relevance and credibility.

The dispute aligns with concerns raised by the Competition Commission of India, which has warned that AI systems can distort competition through automated decision-making, even without human intent. If AI platforms shape market visibility without transparency, they exercise economic power outside traditional regulatory oversight.

What Happens Next

The court directed IndiaMART to notify OpenAI and other respondents through multiple modes, including email and courier. The matter will come up for further hearing on January 13, 2026.

How the case proceeds could shape the future obligations of AI intermediaries in India. The court will examine whether AI platforms must explain exclusions that affect market access, or whether automated systems can continue to operate without clear accountability.

The strategic imperative is to leverage generative AI as a growth catalyst rather than a threat.","As Adobe enters the new year, investors are weighing a complex set of market signals. On one hand, robust financial performance and bullish analyst commentary provide a foundation for optimism. On the other, recent technical weakness in the share price and institutional selling activity have introduced a note of caution. The central investment thesis now hinges on the company's ability to successfully monetize its artificial intelligence offerings.

Contrasting with positive analyst views, data on institutional investors reveals a more cautious stance. On December 31, Marietta Wealth Management LLC reported a significant reduction in its Adobe holdings, selling over 4,000 shares for a decrease of approximately 18.2% in its position.

This transaction fits a pattern of typical portfolio rebalancing at year-end. Many asset managers adjust their weightings within the technology sector, locking in gains or reducing overall risk exposure. While Marietta's move is part of this broader sector-wide rebalancing and not necessarily a direct vote against Adobe, it underscores that some major investors opted for a more defensive posture as the calendar turned.

Mixed Technical Picture to Close the Year

The final trading session of 2025 on the Nasdaq failed to provide clear directional momentum for Adobe shares. The stock closed at $349.99, just below a psychologically significant level, after being unable to sustain several intraday attempts to move higher. The price action suggested a fading of momentum rather than a dynamic year-end finish.

This displayed weakness aligns with a mixed broader chart pattern. While the equity gained roughly 26% over the past month, it remains down by a significant 18% over a twelve-month horizon. Currently trading more than 20% below its 52-week high of $445.25, the stock cannot yet be said to be in a sustained recovery rally.

Bullish Analysts Highlight Valuation Gap

Fundamental analysis presents a more constructive picture than recent price action suggests. A fresh analysis published on Seeking Alpha on December 31 posits that Adobe may be undervalued at current levels, setting a price target of $595—substantially above the present trading price.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

The rationale centers on valuation. Despite widespread concerns that generative AI could disrupt its business model, Adobe posted record financial results for fiscal 2025. Based on these figures, the analysis calculates a forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 15. Proponents view this as a relatively attractive valuation for a company delivering double-digit revenue growth.

The core argument is that the market may be over-discounting the risks posed by AI competition beyond what the current financials justify. This, from the analysts' perspective, creates a gap between market perception and operational reality—representing potential upside if Adobe continues to execute on its growth narrative.

The 2026 Outlook: Monetizing AI is Key

Looking ahead to 2026, execution on corporate objectives takes center stage. Management aims to grow annual recurring revenue (ARR) by more than 10% in the new fiscal year. The success of this forecast is inextricably linked to the effective monetization of AI features, including those powered by Firefly and other tools integrated across the product suite.

The strategic imperative is to leverage generative AI as a growth catalyst rather than a threat. By embedding AI capabilities directly into its subscription models and generating additional revenue from these value-added features, Adobe intends to fortify and expand its market position.

The tension for the initial trading days of 2026 thus stems from the interplay between valuation and expectation: a share price significantly below its yearly peak meets double-digit growth targets and high hopes for AI-driven revenue. Whether the optimistic analyst view prevails or the caution exhibited by some institutional investors sets the tone will likely become clearer with subsequent updates on ARR progress and the adoption rates of AI products in the coming quarters.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2420331_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 12:00:29.044749

Right now, there are three major banks offering cash incentives to lure customers to chop and change their bank.

Bank customers are notoriously stubborn, with many sticking with their bank for decades out of pure inertia despite not necessarily having access to the best rates or bonuses. But right now, First Direct, Nationwide and Santander are offering hard cash to get customers to switch their current bank, with many also offering high-interest linked savings accounts and cashback on top too.

Santander is offering £200 cash up front to switch, the best offer on the market right now. It also pays 1% cashback on household bills, up to a maximum of £10 a month, and access to a linked 6% interest rate savings account. Its Santander Edge account charges a £3 per month fee, but is more than made up for by the cashback.

Santander is also open to anyone to switch from any other big-name bank. Whether you're a customer of NatWest, Nationwide, Lloyds, Halifax, HSBC, Barclays or any other big name, you will be eligible to switch. The only catch is, you can't have held a Santander current account on January 1 2025, and you can't have previously received a Santander switch payment.

There’s a £500 per month minimum pay-in and you must have two active direct debits on your account. You also need to be a UK resident and be over 18.

Santander will then pay the money within 60 to 90 days of the switch being completed.

There’s no set date for the offer to expire, but money expert Martin Lewis says that bank switch deals could be withdrawn at any time, so it’s best to get a move on and lock down a switch deal now.

Why should I care?

For markets: AI is still funded but semis are the scoreboard.

SoftBank’s move says capital is still flowing to AI models and software, even when megacap tech has a weak day. But semiconductors often set the tone because supply constraints and orders show up there first. The split between AI-linked manufacturers like TSMC and more cycle-sensitive names like GlobalFoundries suggests investors may keep rewarding leading-edge AI supply chains while treating the rest of the sector more cautiously.

The bigger picture: Tech is running two cycles at once.

AI compute demand is accelerating, yet parts of the chip industry are still in a slowdown – and that mismatch can redirect spending toward advanced manufacturing and data-center infrastructure. It can also widen the gap between companies exposed to AI capex and those tied to PCs, phones, or older-node production. Meanwhile, deals like TransDigm’s Stellant purchase show steadier end markets can keep consolidation going even when tech sentiment cools.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3531120_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=52aa92cd42a7458d9aacb886d1331e4c,N,,2026-01-01 11:00:47.135094

The United States Postal Service has announced that it will provide entry to its last-mile delivery network.

“Shippers large and small will be able to access the more than 18,000 USPS delivery destination units (DDUs) nationwide via a solicitation process that will begin accepting bids in late January or early February 2026,” the Postal Service said in a Dec. 17 press release.

Prior to launching a dedicated bid solicitation platform, the USPS will meet with shippers to determine their level of interest and hone the bidding process based on shippers’ feedback. More details will be provided in the months ahead, the Postal Service said.

“We want to allow customers to custom-build their last mile solution,” Postmaster General David Steiner said. “We want to make the service as convenient, cost-effective and efficient as possible.”

“The Postal Service’s valuable last-mile network can now be our customer’s advantage,” Steiner said. “Our last mile can become our customer’s last mile.”

Recent substantial investments in modernization have significantly boosted the Postal Service’s package processing and delivery capacity. This will allow the USPS to satisfy a much bigger percentage of the country’s shipping needs than it provides now.

The USPS plans to formalize accepted bids using a negotiated service agreement (NSA).

“The [Postal Service] expects to notify winning bidders in the second calendar quarter [of 2026], and service under those NSAs would begin in the third calendar quarter of 2026,” the Postal Service said.

“By changing the way last-mile service is offered, the Postal Service is expanding the reach of retailers and others who value same-day or next-day delivery,” the Postal Service said. “USPS wants to provide a reach that is unparalleled in the history of the United States.”

These risks include intensified future market competition, challenges after patent expirations, and potential setbacks in the R&D pipeline.","Eli Lilly (LLY) has significantly enhanced its market position and stock price in recent years, driven by its strong performance in the GLP-1 drug sector, making its future prospects highly anticipated. However, outstanding companies never settle for a single track; they consistently strive to seek diversified growth pathways. Recent market rumors suggest that Eli Lilly may be undertaking a significant strategic move—acquiring the French biotechnology company Abivax. This move could inject new momentum into its future outlook.

A Potential Major Acquisition

Large pharmaceutical companies often enrich their product pipelines through acquisitions or licensing agreements, an efficient way to supplement R&D assets. Over the past two years, Eli Lilly has expanded its pipeline through acquisitions in various fields, including oncology. According to media reports, the company is in acquisition talks with Abivax. Abivax’s core asset is the Phase III clinical-stage drug obefazimod, which is intended for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) and has the potential to expand into other immune-related diseases.

Although the UC market already has various therapies, including Eli Lilly’s own product Omvoh, obefazimod has demonstrated significant efficacy in clinical trials for moderate-to-severe patients, particularly those who have not responded well to previous treatments, thanks to its unique mechanism of action. If approved, it could become a “blockbuster” drug. Therefore, this acquisition holds strong strategic appeal for Eli Lilly, though the cost may also be substantial—market rumors have already driven Abivax’s market value significantly higher.

Strategic Considerations for Diversified Expansion

This potential deal highlights Eli Lilly’s strategic mindset of not relying solely on a single growth engine. While its GLP-1 product line remains the core growth driver for the foreseeable future, the company’s management is clearly planning ahead to mitigate potential risks. These risks include intensified future market competition, challenges after patent expirations, and potential setbacks in the R&D pipeline.

Eli Lilly is building long-term competitiveness through a multi-pronged approach: in addition to exploring acquisitions like Abivax to strengthen its immunology portfolio, the company is actively expanding into new therapeutic areas such as oncology and investing in AI supercomputers to enhance the efficiency and success rate of drug development. This forward-looking strategy aims to create a sustainable growth foundation for the company.

Evaluation from an Investor’s Perspective

A nonprofit group that advocates for law clerks is alleging a judge, Sarah Merriam, bullies and mistreats clerks. Now, this is a rare step to file a misconduct complaint against a federal appeals court judge. It is also the latest flashpoint in a debate about whether the federal courts can police themselves. NPR's Carrie Johnson has been reporting on that issue, so we've asked her to come tell us more. Hi, Carrie.

CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi there.

KELLY: OK. Tell us more. What do we know about this judge?

JOHNSON: Judge Sarah Merriam's an appeals court judge on the 2nd Circuit. That's a very prestigious job with life tenure. She was actually nominated by President Joe Biden and previously served as a district court judge and a magistrate in Connecticut. Earlier in her career, she worked as a federal public defender. But I've also learned about some concerns about her behavior in chambers toward her law clerks. A group called The Legal Accountability Project filed a formal complaint based on conversations with her former clerks. Aliza Shatzman is founder of that project.

ALIZA SHATZMAN: We are filing this complaint because we can shoulder risks that, frankly, many law clerks perceive they cannot. But I hope that clerks will learn about this complaint and feel empowered to come forward to file complaints themselves.

JOHNSON: Shatzman says she's heard of the judge yelling, issuing all-caps emails. She says one clerk quit after only one month on the job. And at least four others got offered jobs there as clerks but then withdrew, apparently because they heard problems about the workplace through the whisper network.

KELLY: The response from the court to this complaint is what, Carrie?

JOHNSON: There is no response from the judge herself or from officials in the 2nd Circuit Appeals Court. And a judiciary spokesman here in D.C. has declined comment. The courts actually manage themselves. It's part of their tradition of independence and the separation of powers. But this case is interesting, in part because this project says Judge Merriam is the subject of a previous complaint. There's a public order from 2023 that does not name this judge but seems to match details in the new filing from The Legal Accountability Project. That investigation found the judge had an overly harsh management style. Officials closed the investigation after the judge agreed to watch workplace videos and receive some counseling.

KELLY: Just fill in a little bit of the context here for us. The misconduct process in the federal courts, how is it supposed to work?

JOHNSON: Filing a formal complaint is very rare. Only a few of them are filed every year even though there are hundreds of federal judges. Law clerks are wary because they fear retaliation. They really can't report bullying or abusive conduct without that getting back to the judge, and that could destroy their legal careers. Federal judges have so much power, especially over clerks. And people who work in the federal courts don't have the same employment protections other Americans do. Again, Aliza Shatzman.

SHATZMAN: Federal judges are exempt from antidiscrimination laws. So in most other workplaces, if you are mistreated in this way, you can sue your harasser.

JOHNSON: And that's worth emphasizing. The federal courts are exempt from Title VII antidiscrimination laws. So people who work there generally cannot sue over mistreatment on the job. They have to use the court's internal process to complain and try to seek justice. And our NPR investigation this year found problems with that process.

KELLY: So, Carrie, where does this situation go from here?

JOHNSON: If the 2nd Circuit Court decides to proceed with an investigation, it might interview current and former law clerks and maybe other people in the courthouse or chambers. Shatzman and other advocates for clerks have been trying for years to get Congress to expand workplace protections for people who work for the courts. So far, that's gone nowhere in Congress. And judges can only be removed from office if they're impeached. That hardly ever happens. But in a few recent cases, judges have been pressured to resign or retire. That's what happened with a federal judge in Alaska who allegedly created a sexualized environment with his clerks. He resigned and has since been disbarred.

KELLY: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thank you, Carrie.

To bridge the gap, OpenAI is reportedly developing plans to integrate advertising directly into ChatGPT conversations.

Why it matters

OpenAI sits on a “goldmine” of user intent data. By entering the advertising fray, the Sam Altman-led company would directly challenge the “Big Three” of digital ads—Google, Meta, and Amazon—who currently control 60% of the global market (excluding China).

The Strategy

According to a report citing internal sources, OpenAI is “tweaking” its AI models to prioritize sponsored information in specific contexts.

The UX: Users may see sponsored results for products (like mascara) when asking for recommendations.

The Format: Employees have reportedly mocked up sidebars for sponsored content and clear disclosure labels to indicate paid results.

The Balance: A key internal focus is “not turning off users.” OpenAI is treading carefully to ensure ads don’t feel intrusive or compromise the personal nature of the chat experience.

By the Numbers

OpenAI’s scale makes it a formidable advertising platform:

900 million: Current weekly active users.

2.6 billion: Target active user base by 2030.

60%: Combined market share of Google, Meta, and Amazon in digital ads.

The Pivot

While CEO Sam Altman has publicly downplayed ad ambitions in the past, the company’s recent actions suggest a shift in priority:

Hiring: OpenAI has been recruiting digital advertising veterans over the past year.

Features: Development is underway for shopping features specifically designed to host retail ads.

The bottom line

AI is expensive to run. While OpenAI has relied on subscriptions and enterprise deals so far, the massive compute costs required to reach billions of users are making a high-margin ad model almost inevitable.

What’s next

There is no confirmed timeline for when ads will go live. OpenAI remains in the testing and “mockup” phase as it weighs user sentiment against the need for revenue.",https://techlabari.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nonlinear-000334.jpeg,N,,2026-01-01 03:58:34.922955

Atlanta took control by outscoring Minnesota 37-23 in the second quarter to lead 70-49 at halftime.

Johnson added 10 rebounds and six assists. Onyeka Okongwu had 17 points and Dyson Daniels added 11 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. Daniels also had two steals and two blocks.

The Hawks claimed their first win since beating Philadelphia 120-117 on Dec. 14 and improved to 6-11 at home.

The Hawks were bolstered by the return of Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 16 points in 17 minutes off the bench after missing 10 games with an illness.

“It's really good to have him back because he's a really good player,” Hawks coach Quin Snyder said of Porzingis before the game.

Luke Kennard added 15 points off Atlanta's bench.

Edwards, the Atlanta native, had 24 first-half points. The Timberwolves had too little scoring depth to keep pace with the Hawks.

Julius Randle scored 19 points and Johnny Juzang had 10. Minnesota had no other player score in double figures. Jaden McDaniels had eight points while Rudy Gobert and Donte DiVincenzo each had six. Gobert had 11 rebounds.

Trae Young missed his second consecutive game for Atlanta with a right quad contusion and was in street clothes on the bench for the second half. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who played the last three seasons for Minnesota, scored 11 points as the fill-in starting point guard.

Johnson (illness) started after missing one game.

It’s unclear how much the ride-hailing giant might spend on the acquisition. SpotHero reportedly received a $290 million valuation after its last funding round, a $50 million Series D raise that closed in 2019. The company counts Insight Partners and Battery Ventures among its investors.

Chicago-based SpotHero offers an app that enables users to reserve parking space in more than 400 North American cities. According to the company, its platform provides access to thousands of lots and garages operated by partners. SpotHero claims to have helped customers park more than 100 million cars since launching in 2011.

The platform enables users to reserve spots by the hour, day or month. SpotHero provides a money-back guarantee for customers who can’t access the parking space they booked. Until last September, it also offered discounts to users of Uber’s since-defunct Uber Carshare vehicle rental platform.

SpotHero operates its consumer service alongside an enterprise-focused offering called SpotHero for Business. It enables companies to book parking space for employees near their offices and client sites. A set of connectors can sync parking reservations to an organization’s expensive management system.

For developers, SpotHero provides an application programming interface that makes it possible to integrate its platform into external services. An automaker, for example, could make SpotHero accessible through a vehicle’s infotainment system. Venue operators can use the platform to help visitors find nearby parking spots.

SpotHero also markets its API towards other organizations including public transit operators and ride-hailing providers. If an acquisition materializes, Uber could use the platform to help the drivers in its network more quickly find parking spots. That may enable the company to provide a better customer experience for users of its ride-hailing app.

A SpotHero integration might also be useful for Uber’s autonomous vehicle fleet. In July, the company announced plans to make 20,000 self-driving taxis available through its ride-hailing app. An autonomous vehicle could theoretically use SpotHero’s data on the location and availability of parking spots to drop off passengers closer to their destinations.

In addition to launching new parking features, Uber could use its market reach to scale SpotHero’s API business. The former company has a significant presence in the public transit segment, one of the verticals where SpotHero sells its API. Public transit agencies use Uber’s ride-hailing app to provide backup taxis during service disruptions.

Uber regularly makes acquisitions to support its growth efforts. In 2021, it paid $750 million to buy Transplace Inc., a provider of logistics software that is now part of its Uber Freight business.

And I think Berkshire Hathaway's approach to investing uh will continue as it is. So I I'm optimistic about that. I think some of the uh biggest changes are going to come on the retail front.

You see uh Walmart, uh I think Doug Mcmillan is one of the finest CEOs in the world today along with Satya Nadela at Microsoft and Jamie Diamond at City. and he's stepping down in February and John Furner's taking over.

And if you look at Furner, 30 years, like the ideal grooming he's been CEO of Sam's Club, he's been chief marketing officer, chief merchandising officer. He runs all the US operations.

And Walmart is very well positioned to continue to dominate retail including the online business. So obviously have strong competition from Amazon, but I think you'll see Walmart doing well.

The biggest changes I predict are going to come in Target, which has had a disastrous year uh under Brian Cornell's last year. And I think under Michael Fidelki, uh he's going to return Target to its roots of competing on design and style and having unique offerings that are different from Walmart, more upscale.

Cornell's taking them down a bit on a lower scale and abandoned a lot of things Target stood for when I was on the board. So I think you'll see Michael doing a terrific job in restoring uh Target.

After years of believing that more data and computing power automatically led to better AI, many of those assumptions broke down in 2025. Researchers discovered that smaller models could match or even beat larger systems by reasoning more carefully before responding. Indeed, that became clear when China-based DeepSeek released a highly capable model using far less computing power.

Because of this, major AI labs quickly changed direction. Instead of focusing on instant answers, they began developing “thinking models” that pause, check their logic, and reason step by step using extra compute at inference time. Many researchers see this as the foundation for AI progress in 2026, alongside systems where multiple smaller models work together. At the same time, AI became much cheaper. New model architectures, lighter fine-tuning methods, and smarter system design lowered costs and energy use, which made advanced AI more accessible to companies with specific needs.

Still, these improvements come with important limits. Even smarter models can confidently make mistakes, struggle with originality, and generate information that sounds right but is wrong. On top of that, rising energy demands, environmental costs, and tighter regulations are forcing developers to focus on predictable and transparent behavior. As a result, success in 2026 is likely to be judged by efficiency, trust, and how well humans and AI systems work together in real-world settings.

Artificial intelligence remained the dominant market driver throughout the year, but the theme showed signs of splintering as the rally broadened into other sectors and the performances of the so‑called 'Magnificent Seven' began to diverge. Alphabet emerged as the standout among the megacaps, up more than 65% over the last 12 months, as investors backed the search giant in its push to compete more aggressively with OpenAI.

Markets fell on Tuesday after minutes from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting suggested that policymakers would err on the side of caution when it comes to cutting interest rates in early 2026. Looking forward, some officials indicated that ""it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range [for interest rates] unchanged for some time"".

The bulk of the annual underperformance was concentrated over a few days in April 2025, when the stock dropped 15.46% in five sessions, plummeting from 59.49 euros to 50.29 euros. The market punished the group's dramatically rising net debt, which nearly doubled in a year to reach $20.10 billion in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $14.21 billion a year earlier.

This deterioration of the balance sheet occurred in a context of significantly declining results and uncertainties related to tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, which weighed on oil demand prospects and kept refinery margins under pressure. The drop was also exacerbated by the announcement of US tariffs, which accelerated the stock’s decline.

Attempts at recovery in the following months, especially in May and October with gains of 4.62% and 4.90% respectively, never allowed the stock to regain its early-year levels. Yet, in the third quarter, TotalEnergies posted an adjusted net income of $4.0 billion, consistent with the previous year, and a cash flow of $7.1 billion, up 4%, despite a more than $10 per barrel drop in oil prices year-over-year.

A Fundamental Insight Between Resilience and Concern

In the first nine months of 2025, TotalEnergies generated $136.4 billion in revenue, with an EBITDA of $10.3 billion and a net income of $3.7 billion in the third quarter. These figures reflect some resilience of the integrated model in a challenging environment for the entire sector. The accretive growth in hydrocarbon production of over 4% year-on-year and the improvement in downstream results partially offset the decline in prices. Guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025 anticipated production between 2.525 and 2.575 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing an increase of more than 4% year-over-year, and net investments between $17 billion and $17.5 billion for the full year.

The debt ratio, which reached 17.3% in the third quarter, is expected to stabilize between 15% and 16% by year-end, an improvement from the peak of the second quarter. However, the group revised its share buyback policy downward in September, lowering the amount to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025, down from the previous $2 billion, and planning between $750 million and $1.5 billion per quarter in 2026, effectively halving the return to shareholders in a scenario where Brent prices range between $60 and $70. This reduction disappointed investors, even though the quarterly dividend was maintained at 0.85 euros, an increase of 7.6%.

Outlook 2026: Balancing Opportunities and Ongoing Vulnerabilities

The consensus among analysts values Total with an average target that, when compared to the closing price of 55.59 euros, suggests limited upside potential, considering the persistent uncertainties surrounding crude oil prices and demand trends. Structural opportunities remain: hydrocarbon production growth is expected to continue with a trajectory of +3% per year between 2024 and 2030, supported by the ramp-up of projects in Brazil, the United States, and Malaysia, as well as increased integration into LNG, with the decision to invest in Train 4 of Rio Grande LNG and signed long-term contracts.

The group has also demonstrated its ability to capitalize on its renewable portfolio, by divesting 50% of assets in North America and France for approximately 1.5 billion dollars. Refining margins in Europe, which rebounded in the third quarter, could also provide occasional support. However, many risks remain: the volatility of oil and gas prices, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties, as well as the conditions precedent linked to certain transactions. If the group manages to maintain its debt ratio within the guided range and generate enough cash flow to finance its growth without deteriorating its balance sheet, the stock could regain a more favorable momentum in 2026. Otherwise, the pressure on shareholder returns might persist, limiting the appeal of the stock for yield-seeking investors.

On December 17, Barclays analyst Etzer Darout raised the firm’s price target on Iovance Biotherapeutics to $10 from $9, while keeping an Overweight rating on the shares. This announcement was made as part of the firm’s 2026 projections, where it revised its valuation targets for the biotech industry.

Earlier in Q3 2025, Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) highlighted a total product revenue of $68 million, which was a 13% sequential increase. The primary driver was Amtagvi sales, which reached $58 million, while Proleukin contributed ~$10 million. The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $250 to $300 million. Management remains optimistic about Amtagvi’s growth, projecting peak US sales in advanced melanoma to exceed $1 billion. This growth is supported by an expanding network of 80+ Authorized Treatment Centers across ~40 states.

A major operational shift is planned for early 2026, when Iovance will centralize all Amtagvi and clinical manufacturing at its internal facility, the Iovance Cell Therapy Center/iCTC. This move is designed to eliminate reliance on contract manufacturers, maximize capacity, and further drive gross margins toward a long-term goal of over 70%.

Beyond melanoma, Iovance is aggressively pursuing a significantly larger market in non-small cell lung cancer/NSCLC. Interim data from the IOV-LUN-202 trial showed a best-in-class profile with an objective response rate of 26% and a median duration of response that was not reached at 25 months. Enrollment of ~80 patients is expected to finish in 2026, supporting a potential supplemental BLA and a commercial launch in H2 2027.

Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes cell therapies using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and other solid tumor cancers in the US.

While we acknowledge the potential of IOVA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Reform Aims to Stop Uninformed Dismissal of Digital Evidence

The Mexican Senate is analyzing a reform to the National Code of Criminal Procedure to prevent the dismissal of digital evidence based on subjective assumptions of algorithmic manipulation. Proponents argue that a legal vacuum allows jurisdictional bodies to reject key evidentiary material without requiring specialized technical expertise. This legislative solution proposes the mandatory use of expert reports to validate or dismiss the authenticity of electronic files in judicial processes. Under the current landscape of procedural digitalization, digital evidence that can be discarded at judicial discretion includes documents in electronic format, including PDF and Docx files, emails, messages from electronic channels or social networks, and audio and video recordings.

If you’ve never heard of ECL, that’s kind of the point. While everyone chases flashy AI plays, this quiet cleaning giant has been stacking wins in the background.

Real talk: Ecolab is basically the behind?the?scenes player helping hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and factories stay clean, safe, and efficient. Not glamorous. But potentially powerful for your portfolio.

So is ECL a must?have or a total snooze? Let’s talk numbers, hype, and whether this stock deserves a spot next to your favorite growth names.

The Hype is Real: Ecolab Inc on TikTok and Beyond

Ecolab isn’t some viral meme stock, but it’s sneaking into the convo in a different way: creator money, sustainability flex, and “boring is the new alpha” investing TikTok.

You’re seeing more finance creators talk about “picks and shovels” plays – the companies that quietly power entire industries. That’s exactly where Ecolab sits: water treatment, hygiene, food safety, industrial cleaning. No drama, just recurring revenue.

Plus, brands and chains bragging about being cleaner, greener, and safer? A lot of that runs through players like Ecolab. So while the ticker isn’t trending every day, the impact is literally everywhere you eat, sleep, and work.

Clout level right now: not meme?stock viral, but definitely “smart money” and sustainability?core.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Here’s the breakdown on whether Ecolab is “worth the hype” or just overpriced soap.

1. The Stock: Slow and steady, not moon-shot

Using live market data from multiple sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Ecolab Inc (ticker: ECL) most recently traded around the low?to?mid $230s per share. Since markets are closed right now, that number reflects the last close, not an active price. Timestamp for this data check: latest available US session close prior to this article being written.

Over the past year, ECL has delivered a solid double?digit percentage gain, beating a lot of defensive names and keeping up with or trailing the broader market depending on the exact window you look at. It is not an “I 10x’d my account” stock – it’s more “I slept fine and still made money.”

Volatility is lower than your favorite high?beta tech rocket, which is exactly what some Gen Z and millennial investors are starting to want: less chaos, more compounding.

Real talk: You’re paying a premium for stability. The valuation is rich versus the overall market, but that’s because Ecolab owns serious market share in critical must?run services that don’t turn off just because people stop scrolling.

2. The Business: Cleaning, water, and safety as a service

Ecolab’s superpower is that it sells more than chemicals. It sells systems, software, monitoring, and long?term contracts.

Hotels and restaurants: Dishwashing systems, sanitizing, food safety.

Hospitals: Infection prevention and hygiene support.

Factories and plants: Water treatment and industrial cleaning.

Those aren’t optional line items. A hotel cannot just “skip cleaning” for a quarter to save money. That makes Ecolab’s revenue more durable than hype?driven consumer apps.

3. The ESG and sustainability angle

If you care about climate and water, this is where Ecolab starts to look like a game?changer. A big part of the pitch is helping companies use less water, energy, and chemicals while still staying safe and compliant.

That sustainability story plays well with regulators, giant customers, and long?only institutional investors that are required to consider ESG in their decisions. Translation: a steady bid under the stock from serious money.

Is it perfect? No. It still works with chemicals and heavy industry. But versus a lot of legacy industrial names, its water?efficiency and safety focus gives it a future?proof narrative that clips nicely into “green, but profitable.”

Ecolab Inc vs. The Competition

Every sleeper stock has a main rival. For Ecolab, think companies like Diversey (historically in institutional cleaning) and big conglomerates with cleaning or water divisions.

But the real rival in the US market clout war is Kimberly?Clark/consumer?facing cleaning brands and industrial players like 3M that sit in adjacent hygiene and safety spaces.

Here’s how the showdown looks from a “your money, your timeline” angle:

Brand clout: Consumer brands win TikTok and unboxing content. People post about the wipes they use at home, not the industrial sanitizer in a hotel kitchen. On pure social virality, Ecolab loses.

Institutional power: This is where Ecolab dominates. It is the name your favorite hotel chain, fast?food brand, or hospital admin actually knows. Once it’s integrated into a building or operation, switching is painful and risky. That switching cost is Ecolab’s cheat code.

Winner? In the clout war, consumer brands win the aesthetics. In the cash?flow war, Ecolab looks like the stronger long?term compounder. For serious investors looking beyond memes, Ecolab is the pick.

The Business Side: ECL

Let’s zoom in on the ticker you actually trade: ECL, linked to ISIN US2788651006.

Pulling fresh data from multiple finance sites (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), ECL’s last close sits in the low?to?mid $230s per share. Again, that’s last close data, not a live tick, because markets are not actively trading at the time of this article. Timestamp: most recent US market close prior to publication.

Over the last year, performance has been:

Up solidly versus a lot of classic defensive names.

Roughly in line with or slightly behind some of the loudest growth darlings, but with way less drama.

Backed by steady revenue growth and margin expansion as cost pressures ease and pricing sticks.

From a price?performance standpoint:

If you want a quick flip or “price drop” entry you can brag about next week, this is probably not it.

If you want a long?term compounder with real cash flows, institutional backing, and global scale, ECL starts to look like a no?brainer at the right valuation.

Risk side:

Valuation is not cheap. You are paying up for quality.

If industrial activity or hospitality spending stalls, growth could slow.

Competition and regulation in chemicals and water treatment can tighten margins if Ecolab slips on innovation.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s answer the only question that matters: cop or drop?

Is it worth the hype? For social media clout, not really – Ecolab is way too low?key to go viral daily. But in the “boring stocks that quietly build wealth” meta, the hype is earned.

Who is ECL for?

Investors who like steady, recurring revenue and global scale.

People who want some industrial exposure without going full cyclical YOLO.

Anyone building a long?term core portfolio that can survive multiple economic cycles.

Who should probably pass?

Short?term traders chasing breakout charts and meme?able volatility.

Anyone only interested in ultra?high?growth software or pure AI plays.

The audacious move, funded in part by a strategic exit from Nvidia, marks a seismic shift toward concentrated infrastructure spending and a new era of global generative AI competition.

Deal closed: SoftBank completed the $40 billion commitment with a final tranche of about $22–22.5 billion, locking in just over a 10% ownership stake.

Valuation context: The funding was priced at about a $260 billion pre‑money valuation for OpenAI.

Funding source: SoftBank sold a $5.8 billion Nvidia stake and took other liquidity steps to fund the deal, underlining a strategic shift away from some hardware positions.

Infrastructure ambitions: OpenAI plans massive spending on compute and datacentre capacity, with public figures and reporting suggesting multi‑trillion‑dollar long‑term investments across partners like Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom.

Ecosystem effects: The capital strengthens OpenAI’s hand for an IPO, fuels projects such as Stargate, and tightens competition with rivals like Anthropic and Google DeepMind.

Why this feels like a turning point

SoftBank’s cheque is loud and tactile , imagine the soft whirr of datacentre fans but on a global scale.

This isn’t a symbolic minority stake, it’s a strategic positioning that gives Masayoshi Son’s group meaningful influence at one of the fastest growing tech platforms of the decade.

For investors and governments alike, the payment is a visible sign that AI is moving from speculative to infrastructural spending.

How the package came together

The $40 billion wasn’t a single headline cheque. SoftBank’s involvement reportedly began with an $8 billion direct injection, then a further $10 billion syndicated through partners, and finally the roughly $22 billion tranche that wrapped up the commitment.

The conglomerate freed up cash by selling its $5.8 billion Nvidia holding, a move covered widely in the financial press and one that highlights how capital is being reshuffled within the AI supply chain.

What this says about the market

We’re seeing a phase where strategic investors prefer concentrated stakes in leading AI platform players rather than smaller, diversified hardware bets.

SoftBank’s pivot echoes a broader pattern: big cheques to software‑led AI companies, while hardware makers remain crucial suppliers.

The consequences ripple through chip markets, Nvidia’s stock moves, partnerships with Azure or Oracle, and deals like Disney’s content collaboration for AI video tools all tie into the same competitive scramble.

What this means for customers and competitors

If you run cloud services, build models or produce IP that could be monetised by generative AI, expect faster productisation. OpenAI’s capital plans are meant to underwrite huge compute needs and speed new features to market.

For businesses choosing vendor partnerships, the takeaway is simple: aligning with large cloud or chip providers that have deep ties to major AI platforms will reduce risk and latency.

For faster chewers, startups and rivals, this raises the bar for capital intensity and access to bespoke hardware.

Risks, rewards and the human angle

Big bets carry big risks.

Funding this scale concentrates power and raises regulatory and geopolitical questions about where critical AI infrastructure sits.

That said, the payoff could be transformative, better models, richer tools and a faster rollout of AI‑assisted products across industries.

And on a human level, expect an influx of talent, acquisitions and collaborations that will shape how we interact with AI daily, from content creation to enterprise automation.",https://www.itp.net/cloud/2025/12/31/SoftBank.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 17:01:26.874687

OpenAI is reportedly paying its employees more than any major tech startup, showering workers with an average of $1.5 million each in stock-based compensation — a staggering sum that amounts to nearly half of the company’s projected 2025 revenue.

The unusually rich payouts, disclosed in financial materials reviewed by investors, put OpenAI far ahead of peers, with stock compensation averaging more than seven times what Google paid employees before its 2004 IPO and roughly 34 times the average at other major tech companies ahead of their public debuts.

The largesse reflects OpenAI’s aggressive push to retain top artificial-intelligence talent as competition intensifies, with equity awards swelling operating losses and rapidly diluting existing shareholders, according to the investor materials obtained by the Wall Street Journal.

Across its roughly 4,000-person workforce, the equity payouts translate into one of the most expensive payrolls Silicon Valley has ever seen, with OpenAI’s stock-based compensation projected to climb by about $3 billion a year through 2030, the data shows.

The spending surge accelerated after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg began dangling nine-figure — and in some cases, billion-dollar — pay packages to poach elite AI researchers, triggering defections from OpenAI and forcing the company to sweeten retention bonuses.

The recruiting battle intensified over the summer after Meta’s hiring blitz lured away more than 20 OpenAI employees, including a co-creator of ChatGPT, prompting the startup to issue one-time bonuses worth millions of dollars to some research and engineering staff.

The generous pay has come as OpenAI races to defend its position in generative AI — even as the equity-heavy compensation inflates losses and reportedly pushes stock-based pay to about 46% of projected revenue in 2025, the highest level among major tech startups analyzed.

OpenAI recently told employees it would scrap a policy requiring them to stay at the company for at least six months before equity begins vesting — a move that could further drive up compensation as workers gain faster access to lucrative stock awards, according to The Journal.

OpenAI’s pay structure dwarfs that of most large tech companies, which traditionally spend about 6% of revenue on stock compensation in the year before their IPOs, according to data compiled by Equilar.

Google spent about 15% of revenue on stock-based compensation ahead of its 2004 IPO, while Facebook’s figure was roughly 6% before it went public in 2012, according to data compiled by the Journal.

Founded in 2015 as a nonprofit, OpenAI initially rejected profit motives altogether.

That stance shifted in 2019, when the company created a capped-profit subsidiary to attract outside investment. OpenAI justified its decision at the time by arguing that the cost of advanced AI research had grown too large to sustain through philanthropy alone.

The evolution accelerated in recent years as OpenAI sought ever-larger funding rounds to finance the growing costs of large-scale AI research.

After public backlash, legal threats and internal debate, the company completed a restructuring earlier this year that left it operating under a hybrid model. Its commercial arm now functions as a public benefit corporation, while the original nonprofit foundation retains control and a significant equity stake.

A Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.","Corporate America is facing a silver tsunami — and some companies are better prepared than others.

Walmart is redesigning jobs to keep older workers on the payroll. Microsoft is offering what it calls ""wraparound care"" to support healthy aging. Google is coaching its employees to prepare for retirement. Some smaller companies have introduced chief longevity officers to help workers navigate health, wellness, and the transition into retirement.

These are some of the initiatives companies shared with Business Insider, after we contacted more than 75 major employers about their efforts to support aging workers.

Fifteen responded and shared policies that address healthcare and well-being, career longevity, flexible work arrangements, and retention. Many of the companies contacted employ thousands of people working past retirement age. Most didn't respond or declined to comment.

By 2040, it's estimated that about 22% of Americans will be 65 and older, compared to about 18% today. If companies wait to address this aging acceleration, they may miss out on talent, hurt productivity, and lack medical benefits needed to keep workers healthy, experts on aging said.

At Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, about 13.3% of the workforce — or over 200,000 employees — is over 60 years old, and more than 300,000 employees have a tenure of more than 10 years.

""We want to be a great place to work during every stage of life,"" a spokesperson said. ""People come here for a first job or a second career, and we have associates from 16 to 100.""

Thomas Magnuson, 83, has worked as a yard driver at a Walmart facility in Wisconsin since 1999. A few years ago, he transitioned to an asset protection position, where he monitors fire systems and recertifies employees who use certain equipment. Magnuson said he doesn't have enough savings to retire. He described the work, which pays low six figures, as fulfilling.

Ruth Finkelstein, a professor of public health at Hunter College, said employers should provide mentorship and flexibility to workers of all ages.

""People reach their peak earnings in their 50s and then gradually decrease after that until they abruptly decrease after retirement,"" Finkelstein said. ""We should have retirement security adequate to meet people's needs without them having to work for their whole lives, and we should have legislation that's much stronger than that against employment discrimination.""

How Disney, Starbucks, Google, and others support older workers

Some of the biggest names in the retail, entertainment, and food sectors have proposed age-friendly policies and initiatives to support older workers.

CVS Health has developed programs to attract mature workers and develop their skills. Many of Disney's employees are in their second or third career, said Tami Garcia, executive vice president of people and culture at Disney Experiences. The company gives out the Walt Disney Legacy Award and holds service anniversary ceremonies.

""For many, having a role at one of our Disney parks is a second or even third career, and we deeply value the experience, wisdom, and mentorship that can bring,"" Garcia said. ""From celebrating milestone anniversaries — including 50+ years of service — to honoring those who embody Walt Disney's legacy through our recognition programs, we showcase respect, care, and appreciation for our Cast Members.""

Some companies have prioritized certain accommodations, such as flexible work schedules. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy has invested over $500 million in operational improvements and the workplace experience, which could benefit older workers looking for more flexibility. The spokesperson said that 85% of employees receive their preferred shifts.

Ellen Ernst Kossek, a professor at Purdue University who studies work-life relationships, said companies should consider reducing the workloads of older employees, helping these workers adapt to new technologies, and finding ways to challenge age-related stereotypes.

""There's a stereotype that older workers are not as current, but just as you would train new workers or encourage people to get a certificate, they could adapt their strategies to look for people with AI skills and encourage people to keep their skills up,"" Kossek said.

Some companies told Business Insider that they've adopted certain benefits, such as greater access to medical care, which may help older workers stay healthy and avoid early retirement due to medical issues.

This can be beneficial to both companies and their workers. Older workers can increase corporate healthcare costs, since the majority of people aged 65 and older have a chronic disease, said Dr. Susan Mueller, senior director of health equity and well-being at global advisory firm WTW.

Walgreens offers benefits for ""balancing work with caregiving responsibilities, preparing for retirement, or seeking proactive health and financial well-being support,"" a spokesperson said. UnitedHealth Group provides legal services for estate planning and family law, and supports workers navigating menopause or cancer diagnoses.

A Google spokesperson said the company gives employees access to financial coaching for retirement and personalized assistance for managing caregiving. The company offers benefits such as cancer testing and support, no-cost medical second opinions, and no-cost virtual primary care.

A Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.

FedEx has launched comprehensive medical benefits and support networks, such as its Choose Well Care Connect advocacy program, which guides members through life-altering diagnoses. FedEx launched a Fast Pass in certain markets to guarantee members a primary care appointment within 10 days or less. The company's corporate responsibility report notes that FedEx is testing home health capabilities in areas with limited healthcare opportunities.

Companies have more work to do, experts say

Topics like AI and climate change are garnering more attention in corporate America than the aging workforce, according to a Business Insider analysis of earnings calls, 10-Ks, and interviews.

That's a concern to some experts on aging, who say companies need to be doing more to prepare for shifting demographics.

Mueller said companies should develop programs that control costs for employees needing medical assistance; establish internal guidelines to help employees navigate the healthcare system; add virtual primary care; and hire external companies specializing in common medical conditions.

Madonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University, said that during economically hard times, older workers are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.

Harrington Meyer said companies should focus on accessibility and safety. They should arrange parking spots near office entrances, ensure good lighting and soundproofing for sensory needs, and maintain functional elevators.

Graham Pearce, global defined benefit segment leader at the consulting firm Mercer, said some companies will need to confront an""unconscious bias"" against older workers — often seen as less adaptable or more prone to illness. Progress may require legislative action, he said.

Legislative action

The bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act was introduced in September to prohibit age-based applicant sorting for employers, ensure ""disparate impact"" protections apply to employees and applicants, and require government oversight on age discrimination claims.

Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia who co-led the bill, told Business Insider that he hopes age discrimination will be considered ""as illegal as discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex."" He added that if more people have employment opportunities later in life, it could stimulate the economy and help people age with dignity.

In September, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Americans Act, which would end forced arbitration clauses prohibiting victims of age discrimination from suing their employer.

""We know that forced arbitration often discriminates against the plaintiff, and for a lot of older Americans, they don't have the resources to mount significant litigations against an employer who discriminates against them,"" Gillibrand told Business Insider. ""We believe that if you have the right of the Constitution to go to a trial and to be judged by your peers, older Americans would do better in these lawsuits.""

Nevertheless, if a deal were to happen, it could create natural synergies between parking and ride-hailing. Uber could offer drivers more services when they use their own cars, such as reserving parking, and then make it easier for them to switch to ride-hailing after parking. This would fit with Uber’s push to expand beyond rides, which already includes rental cars, ski lift tickets, high-speed trains, and its growing Uber Eats delivery business. At the same time, Uber faces rising competition from autonomous vehicle players like Waymo (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA), thereby making added services more strategically valuable.

Interestingly, SpotHero operates in more than 11,000 locations across over 400 cities in the U.S. and Canada. The company works with parking garages and lot owners by taking a share of customers’ parking fees. More importantly, CEO and cofounder Mark Lawrence has said that SpotHero is the largest player in its space and has survived while many competitors have faded. It has also built key partnerships, including integrations with Google Maps and Google Search since 2024 and Apple (AAPL) Maps since 2023.

Here's one key takeaway. Eli Lilly isn't content with its dominance in the weight management market. True, this area will be its biggest growth driver for the foreseeable future. But several things could go wrong.

As unlikely as it may seem at present, another drugmaker could potentially steal a significant market share from Eli Lilly within its core therapeutic area. And, of course, the company's top medicines, currently under patent exclusivity, will eventually lose their exclusivity -- although that's far into the future.

Or its amazing drug discovery engine could stop producing breakthrough GLP-1 therapies. This is essentially what happened to Novo Nordisk. Although it had what appeared to be a secure lead in the GLP-1 category, from which it generated almost all of its revenue, several clinical setbacks, coupled with competition from Eli Lilly, led to worsening financial results and a decline in market share for the Denmark-based drugmaker.

Eli Lilly is considering all these risks and planning accordingly, and doing so years in advance. That's also why the pharmaceutical giant has been making a push in oncology. And why it is building an artificial intelligence supercomputer that could help it develop medicines much faster and at lower costs.

Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's financial results are strong, something that should remain the case at least through the next few years. Between that and the solid foundation it is laying for the future, Eli Lilly's shares look attractive, whether or not the acquisition of Abivax happens.

After a year defined by dizzying volatility—ranging from a massive early-year surge to a historic mid-summer slump—the greenback is closing December on a high note. This eleventh-hour advance, fueled by surprisingly resilient labor data and a fractured Federal Reserve, has provided a stabilizing ""impulse"" to a currency that spent much of the year in a state of freefall.

The immediate implications are significant for both Main Street and the C-suite. While the US Dollar Index (DXY) is set to finish the year down approximately 9.5%, its recent rebound from October lows suggests that the narrative of ""US exceptionalism"" isn't entirely dead. For investors, the year-end strength offers a reprieve from the currency's broader 2025 decline, though it complicates the outlook for 2026 as the market grapples with a labor market that refuses to break and a central bank deeply divided on its next move.

A Year of Policy Shocks and Labor Market Resilience

The story of the US Dollar in 2025 is one of two distinct halves. The year began with the DXY at multi-year highs near 110.00, driven by aggressive expectations of new trade tariffs and fiscal stimulus. However, this momentum evaporated in April following a chaotic ""policy horror show."" An executive order for reciprocal tariffs on April 2 initially spooked global markets, only to be followed by a ""Tariff Time-Out"" (TTO) on April 8. This policy whiplash triggered a massive sell-off in the dollar as investors pivoted toward a more cautious global outlook. By July 1, the DXY had plummeted to 96.37, marking its worst first-half performance since the 1970s.

The final quarter of 2025 introduced a new layer of complexity: a 43-day government shutdown that paralyzed federal data reporting. This delay pushed the critical November Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report into mid-December, creating a vacuum of information that initially weighed on the dollar. When the data was finally released on December 16, it revealed a surprisingly robust 155,000 jobs added, far exceeding the pessimistic forecasts of a sub-100k print. This ""better-than-feared"" outcome was punctuated today, December 31, by initial jobless claims falling to 199,000—the third consecutive weekly decline.

This late-year data blitz has allowed the dollar to claw back ground. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has been the primary architect of the dollar's wider annual decline. Despite three 25-basis-point rate cuts in the second half of the year, the December FOMC meeting revealed a significant internal rift. The 9–3 vote to cut rates to a range of 3.50%–3.75% was the most contentious in years, with hawks pointing to ""sticky"" inflation—driven by earlier tariff-related price shocks—as a reason to halt further easing. This hawkish dissent provided the fundamental floor for the dollar’s year-end rally.

Multinationals Win Big as Domestic Sectors Lag

The broader 2025 decline of the US Dollar has been a boon for American multinationals, which generate a significant portion of their revenue abroad. As the dollar weakened throughout the summer and autumn, foreign earnings became more valuable when converted back into USD, providing a tailwind for some of the world’s largest companies.

Tech giants have been the primary beneficiaries of this trend. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) both reported substantial revenue boosts in their late-year earnings calls, citing favorable currency translation as a key driver of their beat-and-raise quarters. Similarly, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) saw its cloud margins benefit from a weaker dollar, which made its services more price-competitive in European and Asian markets. In the consumer space, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) raised its annual forecast mid-year, explicitly noting that the dollar's slump helped offset the rising costs of raw materials linked to trade policies.

However, the ""winners"" circle was not universal. Domestic-focused sectors, such as regional banking and real estate, found little relief in the dollar's decline. For companies like Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE: EW), the year was a lesson in hedging; the company’s CFO noted that they successfully reversed nearly $100 million in expected currency headwinds, turning them into tailwinds by the third quarter. Conversely, companies like Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE: LEVI) had to navigate a complex environment where the benefits of a weaker dollar on international sales were partially offset by the increased cost of imported textiles due to the year's earlier tariff volatility.

Breaking the ""Invincible"" Dollar Narrative

The wider significance of 2025 lies in the shattering of the ""invincible dollar"" narrative that dominated the early 2020s. The year’s performance fits into a broader trend of global ""de-dollarization"" fears and a shift toward a multi-polar currency regime. The 10% annual retreat suggests that the market is no longer willing to price in US exceptionalism at any cost, especially when fiscal deficits remain at record levels and trade policy remains unpredictable.

Historically, the volatility of 2025 echoes the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973, where a sudden shift in policy led to a prolonged period of dollar weakness. The ""Tariff Time-Out"" of April 2025 may be remembered as a similar turning point, where the limits of using the dollar as a geopolitical lever were laid bare. The ripple effects have been felt most acutely by trading partners in the Eurozone and Japan, who spent much of the year grappling with the inflationary pressures of their own strengthening currencies against the greenback.

From a policy perspective, the 2025 rollercoaster has forced the Federal Reserve into a corner. The central bank is now balancing a cooling but resilient labor market against ""sticky"" inflation that has refused to drop below 2.7%. This internal friction suggests that the ""Fed Put""—the idea that the central bank will always step in to support the economy with lower rates—is becoming more expensive to maintain.

The Path to 2026: Stability or a New Slide?

Looking ahead to 2026, the short-term outlook for the dollar depends heavily on whether the December rally is a trend reversal or merely a ""dead cat bounce."" If the labor market remains as tight as the year-end jobless claims suggest, the Fed may be forced to pause its rate-cutting cycle earlier than the market expects. This could provide a sustained boost to the dollar, potentially pushing the DXY back toward the 100.00 level in the first quarter of the new year.

However, long-term challenges remain. The structural issues of 2025—high fiscal spending and trade uncertainty—have not been resolved. Strategic pivots will be required from corporate treasurers, who must now decide whether to lock in hedges at these slightly higher year-end rates or bet on a continued long-term decline. Market opportunities may emerge in emerging market currencies, which have been suppressed by the late-December USD strength but remain fundamentally undervalued if the US economy slows in 2026.

A Year of Lessons for Investors

In summary, 2025 was the year the US Dollar finally met its match in the form of domestic policy shifts and a cooling global appetite for USD-denominated assets. The year-end rally, while impressive in its timing, does not erase the fact that the dollar has lost nearly a tenth of its value over the last twelve months. The key takeaway for investors is that the currency market has entered a new era of high-frequency volatility where labor data and ""sticky"" inflation are the primary drivers of value.

As we move into 2026, the market will be watching the Federal Reserve’s internal divisions closely. If the hawkish minority becomes the majority, the dollar could see a resurgence. However, if the labor market finally begins to show the cracks that many feared during the government shutdown, the dollar’s rollercoaster may have many more drops ahead. For now, the greenback ends the year bruised but standing, a testament to the enduring, if diminished, resilience of the American economy.

Leading plans for Saudi data centres

$18bn-24bn partnership with Nvidia

Humain has received a shipment of Nvidia’s latest artificial intelligence chips as the Public Investment Fund-backed company accelerates plans to build data centre capacity in Saudi Arabia.

Gulf states are pouring billions into AI infrastructure to diversify their economies, helped by a thaw in Washington’s approach to exporting advanced chips that followed President Donald Trump’s visit to the region.

“The first shipment of latest state-of-the-art Nvidia AI GPU chips have arrived,” Tareq Amin, CEO at Humain, wrote on LinkedIn on Tuesday.

“The team will be fully focused on rapid deployment, ensuring everything is up and running before the start of the new year.”

The high-performance chips, known as graphics processing units or GPUs, process large amounts of data far more quickly than standard computer components.

Humain is building the data centres and compute – computing capacity needed to train and run AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT – betting that cheap energy and state backing can help Saudi Arabia attract global customers.

US-based Nvidia, now worth over $4.5 trillion and the world’s most valuable company by market capitalisation, dominates the market for GPUs. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia are major buyers.

Humain, chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said in November it had expanded its partnership with Nvidia and plans to deploy up to 600,000 of its chips over the next three years.

Nvidia’s GPUs are priced at $30,000 to $40,000, so 600,000 units would cost roughly $18 billion to $24 billion.

The pace of Saudi Arabia’s rollout has led some industry watchers to predict that compute capacity could outstrip local demand in the short term, enabling it to market spare capacity abroad as global demand rises.

Mahesh Jaishankar, a senior adviser at consultancy Arthur D Little, told AGBI in May that the compute based on the number of chips being deployed “could be far more than the demand of the country. So the expectation is that they are going to have to export in some form.”

Humain is also working with other partners to build capacity.

It said in November that it would develop data centres in Saudi Arabia with Elon Musk’s xAI, anchored by a 500-megawatt facility, and that Amazon’s AWS would deploy and manage up to 150,000 Nvidia GPUs in a dedicated “AI Zone” in Riyadh.

Comfort Systems vs. Other Market Players Comfort Systems has accelerated growth through targeted add-on acquisitions and a rapidly expanding backlog, winning work across data centers, industrial HVAC and large commercial projects.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Comfort Systems stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).","Comfort Systems USA FIX has been witnessing gross margin growth since the start of 2025. For the first nine months of 2025, its gross margin expanded year over year by 340 basis points (bps) to 23.6%, with the metric increasing 370 bps in the third quarter. The sustained improvement has been driven by a favorable project mix, execution discipline and strong end-market demand.

The primary driver of the company’s margin expansion is its growing exposure to technology and advanced manufacturing projects, which account for the majority of its backlog. As of the third quarter of 2025, FIX’s backlog of $9.38 billion grew year over year by 65% from $5.68 billion and 15.5% sequentially. Year-to-date, the Technology sector accounted for about 42% of revenues, up from 32% reported last year, as hyperscale and AI-driven infrastructure projects continue to scale in size and urgency. These projects tend to be larger, more complex and less price-sensitive, allowing Comfort Systems to bid selectively and protect pricing. Management has repeatedly emphasized disciplined bidding and walking away from low-return work, which has supported higher gross profit per dollar of revenue.

Despite labor constraints across the construction industry, FIX has benefited from its decentralized model and experienced local operators, enabling better labor deployment and tighter cost controls.

Comfort Systems enters 2026 with strong visibility, robust cash generation and a backlog skewed toward higher-margin verticals. While holding above 24% indefinitely may be challenging, the company appears well-positioned to keep gross margin structurally higher than its pre-2024 levels, suggesting that the recent margin gains are more structural than cyclical.

Comfort Systems vs. Other Market Players

Comfort Systems has accelerated growth through targeted add-on acquisitions and a rapidly expanding backlog, winning work across data centers, industrial HVAC and large commercial projects. But the firm does face substantial competition from key market players, including Carrier Global Corp. CARR and AECOM ACM.

Carrier Global is reshaping its portfolio through strategic mergers and acquisitions, alongside divestitures, adding climate and intelligent-energy assets while exiting non-core businesses. These moves reflect efforts to stitch together products, controls and services at scale to build electrification and efficiency plays. On the other hand, AECOM competes from a different vantage. Its global engineering and design platform, massive project pipeline and heavy-civil capabilities make it the go-to for the largest, technically complex infrastructure and energy projects that require end-to-end delivery and engineering depth.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

A few years from now, you’ll wish you’d owned this stock.

The best part? You can discover everything about this company and its groundbreaking technology right now.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

De fait, le contexte est devenu plus difficile pour la troisième plateforme chinoise d'e-commerceavec 18 % du marché (contre 41 % pour Alibaba) et plus de 600 millions d'acheteurs annuels, selon la banque DBS.

Historiquement réputé pour les produits électroniques et high-tech, JD.com vend désormais de tout en Chine, y compris des repas livrés en quelques minutes à domicile. En 2025, le groupe est entré avec fracas sur ce secteur ultra-concurrentiel et miné par une guerre des prix sans merci. Bilan : jusqu'à 25 millions de repas distribués par jour grâce à ses 150.000 livreurs à travers la Chine, mais une perte équivalente à 1,7 milliard d'euros au deuxième trimestre.

JD.com accélère aussi dans la distribution physique à l'international, en témoignent le rachat des 90 supermarchés de la chaîne Kai Bo à Hong Kong et surtout son OPA sur la chaîne allemande Ceconomy, qui détient 22 % de FNAC Darty… En France, le groupe vient de lancer JoyBuy, une plateforme où l'on trouve aussi bien les derniers iPhone 17 que des shampoings L'Oréal.

Microsoft Stock Technical Analysis

Microsoft shares hit a new all-time high of about $555 in late July before pulling back below $500 in September. The stock bounced back to retest the ATH in late October, but has now plummeted to $487.

The latest pullback saw the MSFT stock fall below the 100-day moving average before finding support at the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement level, at $475. The stock faces immediate resistance at the 0.236 Fib level at $505, should the latest rebound continue.

The Relative Strength Index indicator also supports a short-term rebound, with the 14-day smoothed moving average bouncing back after being on the verge of entering oversold conditions.

Strong Earnings Report and Decent Outlook

Microsoft posted better-than-expected fiscal Q1, 2026 results, with revenue growing 18% year-over-year to $77.67 billion versus a forecast of $75.49 billion. Earnings per share also exceeded the expectation of $3.65, with $4.13.

Microsoft expects a slightly softer revenue growth compared to the previous quarter, with CEO Satya Nadella guiding 14%-16% for a top line of $79.5 to $80.6 billion in the earnings conference call.

This seems a little dovish from the management, especially given the company’s performance in the fiscal first quarter of 2026. However, with a less ambitious forecast, it also makes it easier for the company to beat its own projections.

MSFT Huge Institutional Ownership Provides Stability

The stock continued to experience significant institutional support, with notable investors such as CCLA Investment Management, Vanguard, State Street, Dan Loeb’s Third Point, and Peter Thiel increasing their stake in the company.

CCLA now holds 713,663 shares of Microsoft, valued at about $369.6 million, with the tech giant now representing about 5.9% of the firm’s portfolio, while Vanguard owns 705,077,786 shares worth over $350 billion.

State Street Corp, which raised its position by about 1% now owns 299,196,519 worth $148.8 billion. Overall, institutions own over 71% of Microsoft stock.

Azure Cloud and OpenAI

When you hear about AI stocks, Microsoft is often not the first stock that pops into mind. However, it is technically one of the major players in the industry, given its 27% stake in OpenAI and the Azure cloud, which now hosts multiple AI applications.

Nadella said in October that OpenAI has now contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, with Microsoft’s exclusive IP rights and API exclusivity for Azure continuing through 2030. The companies also extended the model and product IP rights through 2032, further establishing a potentially stable stream of income for the various product lines.

Azure is now enabling customers from 33 countries to build their own cloud and AI capabilities, with the company highlighting OpenAI and SAP as good examples of companies that are using its cloud service to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector.

Microsoft is also building an Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and agents, as it looks to tap into its wide client base of more than 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 500.

Risks

Despite its underperformance in 2025, Microsoft still trades above its historical average in price-earnings ratio, with 35 versus 31, according to Full Ratio.

The company AI play impact is also under pressure from market risk amid growing concerns of a potential AI bubble.

Conclusion

In summary, Microsoft’s AI play seems to be significantly underrated, as demonstrated by its industry underperformance in 2025. With a majority of the top AI players experiencing massive gains, the MSFT stock is up just over 16% this year, also below the S&P 500’s over 17%.

Therefore, with the stock seemingly finding support at the 0.382 Fib level, Microsoft’s recent rebound could be the start of a major rally, going into 2026.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 18:00:32.403740

Despite the definitive collapse of its $24.6 billion tie-up with Kroger (NYSE: KR) late last year, a growing chorus of Wall Street analysts is doubling down on the grocer. Maintaining ""Strong Buy"" ratings, these experts argue that the market has fundamentally mispriced the company’s standalone value, ignoring a robust ""Plan B"" that prioritizes aggressive shareholder returns and digital transformation over raw scale.

The immediate implications for Albertsons are twofold: the company is now a leaner, more focused entity, yet it continues to grapple with the ""merger hangover""—a combination of suppressed valuation multiples and significant margin pressures from a shifting sales mix. While the broader retail sector has faced headwinds, Albertsons’ current trading price of approximately $17.50 represents a steep discount to its intrinsic value, which some analysts peg as high as $40.00 per share. This valuation gap has turned the stock into a premier ""value recovery"" play for 2026, even as the company navigates a complex legal battle to extract billions in damages from its former suitor.

The Regulatory Block and the Pivot to Independence

The saga that defined Albertsons for over three years reached its climax in December 2024, when a U.S. District Court in Oregon granted the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) request for a preliminary injunction. The ruling effectively killed the Kroger merger, with the court citing concerns that the deal would stifle competition, harm union bargaining power, and lead to higher grocery prices for consumers. This decision followed a timeline that began in October 2022, when the two giants first announced their intent to merge. Over the subsequent 26 months, the companies proposed various divestiture plans—including the sale of nearly 600 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers—but regulators remained unconvinced that a third party could effectively replicate the competitive pressure of a standalone Albertsons.

In the wake of the deal's termination, the relationship between the two grocery titans soured rapidly. Albertsons promptly filed a lawsuit against Kroger for breach of contract, alleging that Kroger failed to exhaust ""any and all actions"" to secure regulatory approval. As of late 2025, this litigation remains a central catalyst for the stock, with Albertsons seeking a multi-billion dollar payout in addition to the $600 million termination fee already owed. This legal maneuver, combined with the company’s immediate pivot to a $2 billion share buyback program and a significant dividend hike, signaled to the market that management was no longer waiting for a ""white knight"" and was instead focused on unlocking value from within.

Winners and Losers in the New Grocery Landscape

The failure of the merger has reshuffled the deck for the entire grocery industry. The primary winners appear to be Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), which have continued to gain market share as the two largest traditional grocers were distracted by years of litigation and integration planning. These retail behemoths have used their massive scale to maintain price leadership, putting further pressure on Albertsons to invest in ""value pricing"" to keep its customer base loyal. Conversely, C&S Wholesale Grocers emerged as a notable loser, missing out on a transformative acquisition of 579 stores that would have instantly elevated it to a top-tier national player.

For Kroger (NYSE: KR), the fallout has been strategic. The loss of the merger means Kroger must now find alternative ways to compete with Walmart’s data capabilities and Amazon’s logistics. For Albertsons, however, the ""loser"" label initially applied by the market is being challenged. While its stock price took a hit following the FTC injunction, the company's ""Year of Investment"" in 2025 has begun to bear fruit. By retaining its most profitable stores—which would have been divested in the merger—Albertsons has preserved its core cash flow, allowing it to fund a $1.5 billion productivity program that analysts from RBC Capital Markets (NYSE: RY) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) believe will stabilize margins by mid-2026.

Industry Trends and the Margin Conundrum

The ""Strong Buy"" thesis for Albertsons exists in tension with real margin pressures. The company has seen its gross margins compressed by nearly 80 basis points over the last year, driven largely by a shift in sales mix. The explosion in popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has boosted pharmacy sales, which carry lower margins than traditional groceries. Additionally, the rapid growth of digital sales—now accounting for nearly 10% of total revenue—comes with higher fulfillment costs. These trends are not unique to Albertsons; they reflect a broader industry shift where ""the box"" (the physical store) is becoming a multi-purpose hub for health, e-commerce, and advertising.

To combat these pressures, Albertsons has leaned into the ""Retail Media"" trend. The Albertsons Media Collective has become a high-margin revenue stream, leveraging first-party shopper data to sell targeted advertising to consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands. This high-margin income is crucial for offsetting the thinning margins in the aisles. Furthermore, the company’s aggressive push into automation—with 30% of its distribution volume slated for automated systems by the end of 2025—represents a historical precedent in the sector. Much like the industry's shift toward self-checkout a decade ago, this move toward back-end automation is seen as the only viable path to maintaining profitability in a high-wage, inflationary environment.

The Road to 2026: Strategic Pivots and Scenarios

Looking ahead, the short-term outlook for Albertsons is dominated by its capital allocation strategy. With a $2 billion buyback authorization in place and a $750 million accelerated program launched in the fourth quarter of 2025, the company is effectively ""buying its own recovery."" Analysts at UBS (NYSE: UBS) suggest that if Albertsons can successfully capture even a fraction of the damages sought in its lawsuit against Kroger, the company could potentially retire up to 15% of its outstanding shares, providing a massive boost to earnings per share (EPS) even if organic growth remains modest.

The long-term scenario involves a potential monetization of the company's real estate. Albertsons owns a property portfolio valued at roughly $14.3 billion—nearly equivalent to its entire market capitalization. While management has resisted a full-scale sale-leaseback program to date, the ""hidden value"" of these assets provides a significant safety net for investors. Should the company face a prolonged downturn, these assets could be tapped to fund further dividends or debt reduction. The most likely outcome for 2026 is a steady re-rating of the stock as it proves its ability to grow digital and pharmacy sales without sacrificing the bottom line.

A Value Play Hidden in Plain Sight

The story of Albertsons in 2025 is one of resilience and a stark disconnect between market perception and fundamental reality. While the ""complex regulatory environment"" effectively blocked its path to a merger, it also forced the company to refine its standalone strategy. The key takeaway for investors is that Albertsons is no longer a speculative merger play; it is a disciplined value stock trading at roughly 5x projected EBITDA—a valuation usually reserved for companies in terminal decline, not those with 20% digital growth and a multi-billion dollar real estate backstop.

Moving forward, the market will be watching for stabilization in grocery margins and the first major rulings in the Kroger litigation. If Albertsons can demonstrate that its productivity program is successfully offsetting labor and pharmacy costs, the ""Strong Buy"" ratings currently seen as contrarian may soon become the consensus. For now, the grocer remains a compelling example of how regulatory setbacks can sometimes pave the way for a more focused and shareholder-friendly corporate evolution.

(“HPQ” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: HPQ, OTCQB: HPQFF, FRA: O08), a technology company driving innovation in advanced materials and critical process development, released a year-end corporate update summarizing a year defined by decisive strategic realignment, deep technical validation, and tangible progress toward near-term revenue generation across its core technology platforms.

Building on the success of its R&D work in 2025, HPQ is shifting towards a more focused, execution-oriented strategy centered on the commercialization of technologies offering strong market relevance and scalable economics.

“2025 was the year in which HPQ moved from broad technology development to a focused commercial intent,” said Bernard Tourillon, Chairman, President, and CEO of HPQ Silicon. “We spent the year aligning the company around platforms that can generate value in the foreseeable future, while maintaining the technical integrity that has always defined HPQ. That balance is not easy, but it is necessary.”

Fumed Silica Reactor: A streamlined alternative to legacy fumed silica manufacturing routes

In 2025, the Fumed Silica Reactor (FSR), developed in partnership with PyroGenesis through HPQ Silica Polvere Inc [1], emerged as one of HPQ’s two most advanced technology platforms. Over the course of the year, the project progressed from pilot commissioning to meaningful industrial validation.

Key achievements included:

Successful production of fumed silica at pilot scale

Independent confirmation of morphological equivalence to commercial material

Achievement of commercial material surface areas assessed under BET testing protocols

Progress toward semi-continuous operation and throughput optimization

Collectively, these results supported HPQ’s core technical premise: that fumed silica can be produced in a single step using a lower-energy, lower-carbon plasma-based process, offering a streamlined alternative to legacy manufacturing routes that have historically relied on complex, capital-intensive, and environmentally challenging multi-step processes.

“What mattered to us in 2025 was demonstrating, step by step, that the reactor performs at scale in line with theoretical models and laboratory results,” said Bernard Tourillon. “Reaching that point changes the nature of the discussion—from whether the technology works to how fast can it be deployed.”

With global demand for fumed silica expanding across batteries, advanced materials, energy systems, and increasingly datacenter and AI-driven infrastructure, HPQ believes its timing and positioning are converging.

“Fumed silica is rapidly becoming a strategic material,” added Tourillon. “It’s growing role in energy storage, electronics, and next-generation computing is expected to drive demand well beyond the capacity of today’s manufacturing infrastructure. The FSR directly addresses this gap by enabling a purpose-built production pathway designed for scale, rather than incremental refinement of legacy, multi-step processes.”

Battery Materials: Advancing from Laboratory Validation to Commercial Production

During 2025, HPQ advanced its silicon-based anode materials initiative, developed through its strategic partnership with Novacium SAS, which emerged as HPQ’s second most commercially advanced technology platform.

In the first half of the year, Novacium’s GEN3 silicon-based anode materials, deployed in commercially sized 18650 lithium-ion lab scale cells, achieved a key performance milestone by sustaining high-capacity retention beyond 1,000 charge cycles. This performance exceeded that of leading commercial graphite-based cells by at least 30%.

These independently validated results confirmed both the material’s seamless integration potential within existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing processes and its measurable performance advantages over conventional graphite-only anode systems—marking a significant step toward commercial production readiness.

In the second half of 2025, HPQ and its technology partner Novacium SAS advanced the silicon-based anode materials initiative beyond laboratory and materials validation into commercial-scale lithium-ion cell manufacturing. This phase included the production of commercially sized 18650 (4,000 mAh) and 21700 (6,000 mAh) cells incorporating GEN3 silicon-based anode materials.

These activities culminated in the launch of the HPQ ENDURA+ battery platform, and the successful completion of the certifications required for commercial distribution. Collectively, these milestones validated HPQ’s core premise that its silicon-based anode materials can be integrated into existing battery manufacturing architectures and scaled into commercially qualified products—marking a clear transition from upstream materials development to downstream industrial and commercial execution.

In September 2025, HPQ received strong third-party validation of its silicon-based anode materials initiative through the award of up to $3 million in funding from the Government of Canada. The funding was granted under the Battery Industry Acceleration call for proposals of the Energy Innovation Program, administered by Natural Resources Canada.

This investment is intended to support capital expenditures and accelerate the construction of HPQ’s first continuous production system, designed for an initial capacity of 50 tonnes per year, to manufacture silicon-based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries developed in collaboration with its technology partner Novacium SAS.

“What we demonstrated in 2025 was not incremental improvement, but execution across the full battery value chain,” said Bernard Tourillon. “From independently validated GEN3 anode performance to commercial-format cell manufacturing, certification, and now government-supported scale-up, we have methodically removed the key barriers between materials innovation and commercial production. This is the transition point where battery materials stop being a R&D project and become an industrial product.”

Hydrogen-Based Initiatives: Expanding Strategic Optionality Toward Commercialization

During 2025, Novacium SAS continued to advance the development and scale-up of its autonomous hydrogen production platform, METAGENE™, alongside its waste-to-energy technology. This process is designed to convert industrial by-products, such as black dross, into hydrogen and other recoverable value-added outputs.

Leveraging HPQ’s exclusive North American license (Canada, the United States, and Mexico) for Novacium’s technologies, together with its 28.4% equity interest in Novacium, these initiatives further broaden HPQ’s strategic optionality by extending its technology portfolio beyond advanced silicon materials for batteries into clean hydrogen production and circular-economy applications, with a focus on scalability and long-term commercial relevance.

While these initiatives remained at earlier stages of commercialization in 2025, the work completed during the year confirmed both their technical viability and strategic relevance, particularly for decentralized energy systems and industrial hydrogen applications. 2026 is expected to be a year in which the commercial potential of these platforms begins to become more apparent.

“These platforms give HPQ strategic optionality,” said Tourillon. “But optionality only has value when it is pursued with discipline. In 2025, our role was to advance these technologies responsibly, while maintaining a clear focus on executing our primary commercialization priorities.”

Strategic Discipline: Increased Focus on the Commercialization of Novacium Technologies

Novacium SAS is a privately held French technology company founded in 2022. It operates as an engineering and research-and-development company focused on energy-related materials, with activities centered on silicon-based materials and hydrogen systems. Since its formation, Novacium has developed an extensive portfolio of intellectual property relating to its technology platforms.

Novacium is presently advancing the development of the following technology platforms:

Silicon-based anode materials intended for use in lithium-ion batteries, with the objective of improving energy density while remaining compatible with existing industrial manufacturing processes.

A hydrogen-generation system based on a proprietary silicon–aluminum alloy, designed to produce hydrogen on demand without reliance on external power sources. This technology is being evaluated for potential decentralized and mobile applications.

A waste-to-energy process intended to convert industrial by-products, including black dross, into hydrogen and other recoverable materials.

Based on the results to date, Novacium’s activities are now more focused on engineering optimization, and scale-up assessment.

HPQ management’s evaluation of the potential future applications of Novacium’s technologies contributed to the Company’s decision at the start of 2025 to increase its equity interest in Novacium. This investment is part of our strategy to strengthen long-term strategic alignment and increase HPQ’s exposure to battery materials, hydrogen-related technologies, and recycling-oriented processes.

As North American commercialization pathways for certain Novacium technologies became a clearer area of focus during later part of 2025, HPQ and Novacium clarified their exclusive licensing agreement. The amendments were intended to clarify the scope, duration, and key terms governing existing and potential future commercial licenses that may be granted to HPQ or its subsidiaries.

“Our increased investment in Novacium reflects management’s assessment of the technical progress achieved to date and the potential relevance of these technologies within HPQ’s broader strategy,” said Bernard Tourillon, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HPQ Silicon Inc. “As Novacium’s programs mature, our focus is on disciplined engineering optimization and evaluating scalable commercialization pathways in North America, while maintaining a prudent and structured approach to execution.”

Strategic Discipline: Concluding the QRR Program

As part of its year-end strategic review, HPQ determined that the Quartz Reduction Reactor (“QRR”) silicon metal program, while technically successful, was not sufficiently aligned with the Company’s short- and medium-term commercialization objectives. Management concluded that the capital and resources required to continue advancing the QRR program could be more effectively allocated to initiatives with clearer and faster potential commercialization timelines. As a result, the Company decided to formally conclude development of the QRR program.

This decision reflects a disciplined reassessment of capital allocation priorities, development timelines, and the overall risk–reward profile of the project portfolio.

“The QRR was, and remains, an interesting technology,” said Bernard Tourillon, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HPQ Silicon Inc. “However, as a development-stage company, we must continuously assess where our capital can be deployed most effectively. The cost and time profile associated with silicon metal production no longer aligned with our objective of accelerating commercialization and progressing toward revenue generation.”

He added:

“Concluding a program is not a failure. In some cases, it is a necessary and responsible decision to ensure focus and execution discipline.”

Positioning for 2026: From Transition to Execution

HPQ exits 2025 with a more focused portfolio, multiple technologies that have progressed through key validation stages, and an increasingly defined operational roadmap. During the year, the Company completed financing activities without excessive dilution and strengthened strategic partnerships.

“2025 was a year of transition toward revenue generating-oriented activities,” Tourillon concluded. “Our efforts during the year were directed toward establishing the conditions required for execution. As we enter 2026, management’s focus is on advancing technologies that have reached appropriate levels of readiness, evaluating commercial scale-up opportunities in response to market interest, and seeking to translate technical progress into sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.”

NewPrinces S.p.A. ha perfezionato l’acquisizione del 100% di Plasmon laid down by the controllata italiana di The Kraft Heinz Company, Heinz Italia, portando a termine l’operazione annunciata last July 9. Il closing si è chiuso con un purchase price finale di 124,3 milioni di euro, interamente corrisposti in contanti. Il perimetro dell’acquisizione include l’intera piattaforma industriale e commerciale del baby food e della nutrizione specializzata, insieme a marchi storici come Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten e Dieterba e allo stabilimento produttivo di Latina.

Nel 2024 il business ha generato ricavi per about 170 million euro e un EBITDA pari a 17 milioni. Per Kraft Heinz, l’operazione rappresenta un passo coerente con la strategia di rifocalizzazione sulla piattaforma Taste Elevation, con un’attenzione crescente ai marchi Heinz e Kraft, che in Italia continuano a mostrare una crescita solida sia nel canale retail sia nell’away from home.

La visione strategica di NewPrinces

Per NewPrinces, l’operazione segna un passaggio chiave nel rafforzamento della presenza nei segmenti ad alta marginalità. “Il perfezionamento di questa Operazione rappresenta il compimento di una visione strategica di lungo periodo” ha commentato il presidente Angelo Mastrolia. ""Riportare in Italia marchi come Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten e Dieterba, profondamente radicati nell’identità del nostro Paese, insieme a uno stabilimento produttivo altamente efficiente come quello di Latina, rafforza la nostra posizione quale piattaforma di riferimento nel segmento ad alta marginalità degli alimenti per l’infanzia e della nutrizione specializzata in Italia e in Europa”. L’obiettivo dichiarato è ora l’integrazione industriale e commerciale del perimetro Plasmon, facendo leva sulle sinergie con le attività già presenti nel gruppo per generare valore lungo tutta la filiera.

Plasmon, marchio storico e asset industriale

Fondato a Milano nel 1902, Plasmon è uno dei marchi alimentari più riconoscibili del Paese ed è registrato come Marchio Storico di Interesse Nazionale. Leader nel baby food in Italia, domina categorie come biscotti, puree, cereali e snack ed è forte di una fiducia consolidata presso famiglie e operatori sanitari. Al centro dell’operazione c’è anche lo stabilimento di Latina, sito ad alta capacità che produce circa 1,8 miliardi di biscotti Plasmon l’anno e impiega circa 300 addetti. L’attività proseguirà senza discontinuità sotto la nuova proprietà e continuerà a produrre per Heinz Baby Food destinato al mercato UK tramite un accordo di co-packing.

“Riteniamo che il business sia ben posizionato per proseguire il proprio percorso di sviluppo sotto la guida del Gruppo NewPrinces, leader nel settore food & beverage e partner ideale per la crescita di questi marchi storici” ha evidenziato l’ad di Kraft Heinz Italia Carmela Bazzarelli. “Kraft Heinz ribadisce il proprio impegno in Italia, dove continuerà a focalizzarsi sulla crescita della piattaforma Taste Elevation con i marchi Kraft e HEINZ, supportata da nuovi investimenti e da una maggiore focalizzazione strategica resa possibile da questa Operazione”.

Integrazione, sinergie e nuova struttura operativa

Il razionale industriale dell’operazione punta alla creazione di una piattaforma paneuropea integrata nel baby food. Lo stabilimento di Latina, specializzato in biscotti, puree e pouch, è complementare a quello di Ozzano Taro, focalizzato su latte liquido e formule per l’infanzia. Secondo le stime del management, l’integrazione potrà sostenere una revenue growth di Plasmon con un CAGR di circa il 3% e un progressivo miglioramento del margine EBITDA fino al 15%.

From 1 Jan. 2026 tutte le attività operative di Plasmon saranno trasferite a Princes Italia S.p.A. tramite un affitto di ramo d’azienda, con un canone annuo di 3 milioni di euro più una componente variabile pari all’1,5% dei ricavi.",https://www.firstonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plasmon.webp,N,,2025-12-31 11:59:52.877689

Uh, uh if you look at Oracle, on the surface, um the financial statements show significant growth in the earnings.

We've seen this recent sell off. What do you make of that? Is OpenAI's inability or ability to pay a major risk to Oracle moving forward?

It is indeed a major risk and thank you very much for having me. I I do believe it's a major risk. Open AI according to Microsoft's financial statements, um is losing around $12 billion a quarter and their financial disclosures are not very transparent. And as the as Oracle's largest uh customer, essentially they could be a source of risk. Um one of the biggest component of Capex that Oracle has is building data centers for uh that are contracted with OpenAI and an open question would be in case there's a failure to pay by OpenAI, how can those data centers be repurposed?

Ali, how do investors assess this long-term potential of AI while also taking into consideration the risks on their near-term balance sheet?

I do think that looking at balance sheets actually is a good place to start. Uh, uh if you look at Oracle, on the surface, um the financial statements show significant growth in the earnings. But if you look at the details of those earnings, the earning growth was come from a non- recurring item, which was a sale of a venture that they had with Softbank. and that was that contributed roughly two and a half billion dollars to their earnings. If you take that thought, Oracle is essentially operating income is growing at a fairly respectable 12 to 15%, which is again very good number in and of itself, but it is not the explosive growth that would justify equity valuation to move higher. And another factor that is impacting equity, and that's really like where my interest in Oracle is is on the credit side. If you look at credit spreads, uh Oracle's credit spreads are moving wider and wider because their CAPEX has gone from $6 billion over the prior six months period to a $20 billion. and that's a significant growth in CAPEX that is being funded by credit.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hxWBBdA8CI8mazSioaVGvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/bb5281f0-e5c5-11f0-b7b3-3182b7bd510b,N,,2025-12-31 11:01:56.661980

Hilma Cooper remembers both houses from her girlhood in Knoxville.
Abbie Billings Brewster, a widow for most of her adult life, owned the Brewster House next door.
The Glover House was built in the mid-1820s, and was known in its early years as the Alba House, after the original owner and builder Aaron Alba.
Abbie Billings Brewster was also a granddaughter of Silas Billings.","Books come in all shapes, sizes, and ages, as do the libraries that house them. Think the little, street-side, take-a-book/leave-a-book stands that have popped up all over the place during the past few years, then consider the grandeur of the twin marble lions (their names are Patience and Fortitude, and they’re over 100 years old) serving as sentinels at the steps of the New York Public Library on 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.

The Knoxville Public Library at 112 East Main Street doesn’t have a pair of lions, but it does have a pair of houses—the Glover House and the Brewster House. They each have their own kind of grandeur, and they were always neighbors, but became physically connected just a couple of years ago. They have a combined age of about three centuries, and are themselves literally full of history.

Hilma Cooper remembers both houses from her girlhood in Knoxville. The Glover House belonged to her Uncle Ed and Aunt Jane Glover; Uncle Ed was an attorney, a Civil War enthusiast, and author of local history, and Aunt Jane was a librarian for the Knoxville Public Library and “quite a talented chef,” Hilma says. Abbie Billings Brewster, a widow for most of her adult life, owned the Brewster House next door.

“I knew her as a child,” Hilma says. “She was kind of a fixture in the town.”

Eugene Seelye, a Knoxville historian and author, describes Abbie Billings Brewster as “a very prim and proper lady” who always wore a hat and gloves. Her elegant home had a ballroom on the third floor (more on that later).

Ron Meinstereifel is the historian and museum coordinator for the extensive and eclectic collection of mostly Knoxville-related artifacts and memorabilia that have found a home in the Glover House.

“The neatest thing about the town is that the people preserved things,” Ron says. A houseful of things. There’s a train room with a model of the borough when it boasted two trains and two train stations, a textile room, a military room, an education room, a genealogy room, a music room—you get the idea. A retired psychologist who says he “needed something to do,” Ron has been spending his days unpacking boxes, making discoveries, and sharing what he’s learned about Knoxville’s history.

The Glover House was built in the mid-1820s, and was known in its early years as the Alba House, after the original owner and builder Aaron Alba. It’s a structural marvel, with the original pine beams and sections of the stone foundation remaining—and doing their jobs—in the cellar. The walls supporting the well-crafted rooms are still straight and sturdy. Alba family members lived there until 1886, when the home was sold to Hiram P. Gilbert and his wife, Carrie Bell Billings Gilbert, who was a granddaughter of Silas Billings, one of Knoxville’s earliest businessmen. Abbie Billings Brewster was also a granddaughter of Silas Billings. In 1898, ownership of the home passed to Carrie Gilbert’s mother, Helena S. Billings. She died ten years later, and the house went to her daughter, Jessie K. Beach, and then to her daughter, Ruth Gee, who would have been Silas Billings’ great, great, granddaughter.

Uncle Ed (1908-1996) and Aunt Jane Glover (1916-2009), as they were known to Hilma and her cousin, Brian Edgcomb (who passed away in April 2025), bought the home in the 1940s. The house was willed to Hilma and Brian, eventually donated by them to the library, and later became the museum.

The Brewster House has been home to the library since 1957. The library was founded in 1921, and its original home was on the second floor of the town hall on Case Street. In 1947, Mrs. Ethel Ashton provided the means for the library to purchase and renovate the Episcopal Chapel on Main Street for its use. Mrs. Ashton died in 1955 and, via her bequest, the library was able to purchase the Brewster House from Ernest Billings Brewster, Jr., grandson of Horace and Abbie Brewster.

Horace Brewster was a successful hotelier in San Diego. Eugene, the Knoxville historian who now lives in Wellsboro, writes that Horace and Abbie were married in Elmira in 1890 at her parents’ home. They went to California to live, but eventually returned to Knoxville. Horace built the Queen Anne-style house in 1910; its grand interior included a graceful staircase, carved newel posts with rose-shaded gaslights (they’ve since been electrified), pocket doors, turret room, chandeliers, and a third-floor ballroom.

That ballroom space, complete with tables, tablecloths, and seating that hearkens back to an earlier century, is now available to rent—maybe for a shower or a tea, or some other small get-together. The adjoining turret room, accessible through a hobbit-sized passage, has a view of Main Street. It’s a cozy spot where it’s easy to envision curling up with a good book. Hilma says she remembers when she first saw the room it had college banners in it, so maybe there were some other activities going on there, too.

Improvements and renovations were made to the library about thirteen years ago. Then, after the Glover estate was settled and the house came into the library’s possession, the project to connect the two homes was conceived. As part of the Glover’s commitment to their community, the estate had established the Deerfield Charitable Trust (deerfieldcharitabletrust.com) in 2010. Through that entity the money was made available for the project, which included, in addition to connecting the homes, adding a children’s library/play area, a mezzanine overlooking that section (a great place to sit and read), creation of the museum in the Glover House, and infrastructure improvements.

“Everyone is really excited about the space,” says Erin Cook, library director, of the new children’s area. “A big part of libraries is community.”

“I’m delighted with the way it’s being used now,” says Hilma, adding that it’s still possible to be in the home that was her uncle and aunt’s “and see how it used to be.”

Cheryl Edgcomb, Brian’s wife, has, since her husband’s death, found herself in possession of an abundance of family and community history. She laughs when she tells Ron that “this is all documents and things I’ll be donating to you.”

The DR Automobiles Group recently announced that it had acquired the historic Italian brand, which wrote some of the most important chapters in the country’s automotive history more than a century ago.

The goal is to have the new Itala brand up and running by the end of 2026. It's unclear exactly what the DR Group has planned for this historic name, but there's hope that Itala will become a serious luxury car player in Europe over the next few years.

But in order to appreciate the symbolic weight of Itala's unlikely comeback, it’s worth looking back at one of the most fascinating stories from the early days of Italian motoring.

The Origins

1907 Itala 120 HP

Photo by: RM Sotheby's

Founded in Turin in 1903 by Matteo Ceirano, Itala was born in the heart of Italy’s first automotive industrial district. From the start, it distinguished itself through exceptional build quality and forward-thinking engineering, quickly establishing itself as one of the country’s leading automakers, second only to Fiat in production volumes.

Early models, such as the 16 HP and 24 HP, achieved immediate success in motorsport. That helped the brand earn a reputation for robustness, reliability, and performance.

A key turning point came in 1904, when major investment from Genoa led to the creation of Itala Fabbrica Automobili and the construction of a modern factory. Design was entrusted to leading engineers like Alberto Balloco, whose work produced cars that defined an era.

Among Balloco's creations, the Itala 100 HP became the undisputed star of the 1905 racing season. It won the Coppa Florio and outperformed rivals just down the road, including some of Fiat's best racers.

Success & Cutting-Edge Technology

In 1906, Itala won the first Targa Florio. In 1907, the brand cemented its legendary status with a Peking to Paris victory, won by Prince Scipione Borghese in an Itala 35/45 HP. More than a sporting achievement, the journey captured global attention, with Luigi Barzini’s reports in Corriere della Sera spreading the Itala name worldwide and increasing the brand’s prestige.

In the years leading up to World War I, Itala embodied Italian industrial excellence, offering a wide range of models, an international sales network, and groundbreaking innovations such as the ""avalve"" engine—a quiet, refined design without mechanical valves. These engines delivered performance up to 25 percent better than contemporaries, though at a high production cost.

It was Itala's pursuit of technical perfection, combined with lackluster financial management, that ultimately led to instability within the company.

War and Decline

Photo by: RM Sotheby's

World War I marked a dramatic turning point for Itala. The company shifted to licensed production of Hispano-Suiza aircraft engines, requiring massive investment. Government orders, however, fell sharply after the war, leaving Itala in financial difficulty. Despite producing elegant models such as the 50, 51, and the luxurious six-cylinder 55, Itala struggled to reconnect with a market transformed by the post-war era.

In the 1920s, Itala attempted to relaunch through state intervention and the arrival of Giulio Cesare Cappa, who designed the sophisticated Itala 61. Technically advanced, the model proved too expensive to produce. At the same time, visionary projects such as the 11 and 15 single-seaters—true engineering marvels—never progressed beyond the prototype stage.

Financial troubles deepened, leading to a 1929 merger with the Società Anonima Officine Metallurgiche e Meccaniche di Tortona and subsequent restructuring attempts. The final efforts by the ""new"" Itala SACA in the early 1930s failed to reverse the decline.

In 1934, the curtain finally fell on what many considered ""the other Fiat,"" a brand that anticipated the future but was ultimately undone by its own structural limits.

A Legacy Reborn

The 2026 comeback under the DR Automobiles Group brings the Itala story back into the spotlight—a story defined by innovation, daring feats, and boundless ambition. Even today, it remains one of the noblest chapters in Italy’s automotive history.

We can't wait to see what's next for the Itala brand.

At a time when just 29% of leaders say their organization’s operational risk and process safety management is optimized, here are five ways to embed safety into your 2026 strategic planning: Connect worker safety to business goals.","In high-risk industries like oil and gas, chemicals, and process manufacturing, safety is not just a compliance requirement — it’s a strategic lever for resilience and performance. Yet too often, safety infrastructure lags behind, sidelined by operational demands or budget constraints.

Nearly half of safety leaders (49%) cite the lack and loss of experienced personnel as the top factor increasing risk, while 39% point to limited visibility into operational risks within aging facilities.

Combined with a younger, less experienced workforce and volatile regulatory demands, these risk factors are stretching organizations thin and straining safety programs, just as risks are multiplying.

Despite this, many organizations still rely on outdated systems to manage safety, postponing modernization until it’s too late. When business is booming, safety upgrades fall down the list of priorities. When business slows, budgets tighten and transformation stalls. Inaction in either scenario only amplifies risk to workers.

As you set priorities and budget for the year ahead, make safety a central focus. Do not treat safety as a cost center or a checkbox. Value it as the performance driver it is. Using technology to modernize worker safety standards now is an investment in people, productivity, and preparedness.

Why worker safety still lags in high-risk industries

Caution is natural in high-hazard environments, but it often calcifies into resistance to change.

This mindset is reflected in the tools many organizations use today. Spreadsheets and paper forms remain the norm for managing critical safety processes, even though these methods obscure information and increase the likelihood of missteps.

Across industries, legacy tools that lack real-time visibility and accountability leave workers vulnerable and compromise operational continuity. Take, for example, a maintenance permit buried in a spreadsheet. It may go unnoticed until crews begin hazardous work without proper authorization or equipment, leading to a reactive safety culture where risks are addressed after issues arise.

Even well-designed safety programs can falter in execution. Two-thirds of safety leaders report a disconnect between their safety goals and what actually happens in the field. Leaders may assume compliance, but without real-time insight, accountability erodes and risk exposure rises.

America’s aging infrastructure compounds the challenge. Refineries and chemical plants built decades ago are harder to retrofit and more prone to failure. Ensuring mechanical integrity demands constant attention, yet many teams lack the bandwidth or tools to keep up.

Modernization is widely acknowledged as overdue. But without executive alignment or clear urgency, safety initiatives stall. Over time, these delays stack up, and when a serious incident occurs it’s often too late to avoid a life-or-death scenario.

Making worker safety a business imperative

Improving safety outcomes requires integration across people, processes, and technology. When treated as a business priority, safety enhances operational resilience while also supporting employee experience and protecting performance.

At a time when just 29% of leaders say their organization’s operational risk and process safety management is optimized, here are five ways to embed safety into your 2026 strategic planning:

Connect worker safety to business goals.

Your ability to grow the business depends on worker safety. Safety incidents can halt production, damage morale, and erode customer confidence.

By linking safety initiatives to core business outcomes like uptime, continuity, and productivity, you reframe it as a source of value creation, not just a compliance responsibility.

This reframing also influences investment decisions. When safety is part of conversations about growth and efficiency, it receives the attention it deserves. Treating safety as a business enabler better aligns it with other enterprise goals and makes resilience a shared responsibility, from executives to front-line teams.

2. Standardize and digitize your processes and systems.

Spreadsheets and emails lack the structure and accountability required to uphold safety standards in high-risk environments.

Modernization intervenes by standardizing key workflows under a single source of truth: permit-to-work, management of change, risk assessments, contractor safety, and more. Errors reduce when responsibilities are clear and steps are consistent.

Digitization takes this evolution further. With centralized platforms, permits and inspections move through defined workflows with clear visibility into what’s submitted, pending, or approved, and by whom. This level of easy-to-access detail reduces delays and errors and eliminates redundancy.

3. Make your data work for you.

Integrating systems is only the first step. The real value lies in how data is used to prevent incidents and optimize performance.

Each inspection, permit, or near miss logged into a digital system adds to a rich dataset that reveals emerging and broader operational risks. Empower operators and supervisors with access to relevant data for their shifts and locations, including barriers, isolations, and overdue actions — so teams can anticipate and address issues before they escalate.

Leaders, meanwhile, should monitor forward-looking indicators such as maintenance backlogs and repeated barrier failures.

AI can assist by flagging trends, standardizing reports, and suggesting actions. In high-hazard industries, though, AI must be applied fit-for-purpose with people firmly in the loop. Every alert should feed directly into workflows with clear ownership and timelines, so data quickly translates into action.

4. Champion people alongside technology change.

Technology alone won’t improve safety. A big barrier is often people, especially middle managers who already carry heavy workloads and may hesitate to disrupt established routines.

This makes proactive change management critical. Lead with empathy, clear executive sponsorship, and consistent communication. Highlight how new systems improve workflows, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance worker safety.

Likewise, many younger employees expect digital tools in the workplace, regardless of industry. Modernization supports both recruitment and retention by signaling that both safety and innovation are core values.

5. Build for long-term resilience.

Connected systems create a detailed record of safety performance. From overdue actions to trends in barrier impairments to near-miss reports, aggregated data reveals weak points before they become failures.

For example, trend analysis on overdue actions can prompt early interventions before compliance gaps widen. Spotting clusters of near misses can guide targeted training to prevent future incidents, whether that’s by employee segments or facility locations. An increase in overdue safety tasks might signal other resource constraints that need to be addressed as well.

The value extends beyond immediate fixes. Data-driven safety keeps your business agile so you can more effectively handle what’s next, whether it’s new regulations, workforce turnover, or industry shifts like the transition to clean energy.

Planning for safety is planning for resilience

There will never be a perfect moment to modernize safety. But delaying action — whether due to growth pressures or budget constraints — only raises the stakes. Real people are put at risk.

As you plan and allocate budget for the year ahead, make safety an integral part of your business strategy. Strong, connected safety systems are the backbone of resilience and growth.

Add all of those factors together, and it is no wonder that UA can’t come close to dethroning DL.","Ben is clearly trying to drive his own reader metrics to close out the year. that is perfectly obvious.

Jon’s tweet which so many of you cling to you proves precisely why I have so much fun on this and other sites.

“Year to date cancellation rates, mainline and regional combined, with mainline weighted more heavily than regional.”

Completely predictable. The arrogant UA fan crowd that can’t stand to admit that they really are #2 have to cherrypick and manipulate data in order to show themselves on top. Only in their mind do they weight flights to skew the data which doesn't math otherwise.

UA cancelled far more flights during its spring EWR meltdown including more regional flights (so its narrowbody flights to Europe could operate) but we’re supposed to not only forget that – despite the fact that it made national news for weeks on end – so we can blow a bad DL weekend way out of proportion.

And even if UA ends 2025 with a lower COMBINED rate of cancellations than DL, UA will still trail DL in on-time and, most notably, baggage handling where it sits at the bottom of the industry with AA.

It’s pretty obvious what these discussions are really about: a small group of people w/ low self-esteems (including a number of UA execs) that cannot honestly accept where their company really is and let other people recognize what they have legitimately done to improve that company which was horribly mismanaged UA for so long.

And the bigger issue is that DL, UA and every other US airline are for-profit businesses and UA simply does a far worse job of running its business than DL even though we have heard for the better part of a decade that UA would close the gap w/ DL. In fact, UA’s net profit for the first 3 quarters of 2025 trails DL’s by almost $1.5 billion dollars; DL made 64% more net profits than UA in the first 3 quarters and UA won’t close the gap in the 4th quarter.

I get that everyone wants to be the one that throws the guy sitting at the top off of their reign – but UA is nowhere near close to doing that either financially or operationally – and it takes cherrypicking and data manipulation for them to even try to argue their success.

Let’s also not forget that UA has yet to settle post covid labor contracts with two major unions representing over 1/3 of its entire workforce – which is at the root of what this whole discussion about DL’s pilot workrules and the automation to support it.

DL led the airline industry post covid in settling w/ its pilots in a contract worth twice as much as what UA offered and its pilots handedly rejected. DL then spread pay raises to its non-pilot, non-union personnel which has forced labor costs for the industry – except for UA – to astronomical levels. IOW, DL manages to report the highest profits in the US and still lead the industry in paying its employees. No other airline in the world generates profits on par with DL when adjusted for DL’s labor costs.

And UA loves to get in fights with everyone it can find – WN at DEN, AA at ORD, and any ULCC whatsoever – and UA is throwing more absolute capacity into the industry than any other US airline. UA has managed to turn its TPAC operation profitable but is now consistently losing money flying to Latin America where it is being marginalized and cut off from high value traffic by AA and DL. Add all of those factors together, and it is no wonder that UA can’t come close to dethroning DL.

Peter McGoldrick has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors related to Nike’s ongoing turnaround and its current valuation. He sees encouraging operational progress, including healthier inventory levels in North America that support the thesis of a domestically led recovery, and early signs that the apparel category is regaining volume momentum. He also notes that the company’s renewed emphasis on wholesale distribution, with the highest North America wholesale mix since the pandemic, appears more aligned with Nike’s future channel strategy, even though it entails lower average selling prices. However, footwear unit trends remain lackluster, and the overall volume trajectory is not yet strong enough to confidently underpin the mid-single-digit revenue growth needed to drive the financial model.

At the same time, McGoldrick believes the equity market is already assigning Nike a premium valuation multiple that assumes successful execution of the turnaround over the next several years. With the shares trading at roughly 25 times his FY27 earnings estimate, he views the upside potential as limited relative to the risks associated with restoring market share and normalizing the business, which he expects may not fully materialize until around 2027. While he characterizes the eventual turnaround as likely, he does not yet see a sufficiently asymmetric risk/reward profile to justify a more constructive recommendation. As a result, he maintains a neutral stance and continues to rate the stock as Hold.

In the ever-evolving realm of digital creativity, Adobe Photoshop has long stood as the cornerstone for professionals in graphic design, photography, and visual arts. As we close out 2025, the software’s integration of artificial intelligence has reached new heights, offering tools that not only streamline workflows but also push the boundaries of what’s possible in image manipulation. Drawing from recent updates, these AI enhancements are transforming how insiders approach projects, from rapid prototyping to intricate compositing. This deep dive explores the most impactful features, their practical applications, and the implications for industry practitioners.

At the heart of Photoshop’s latest advancements is the Generative Fill tool, which has evolved significantly since its introduction. Powered by Adobe’s Firefly AI model, it allows users to add, remove, or expand elements within images using simple text prompts. For instance, professionals can now seamlessly extend backgrounds or insert objects that blend naturally with existing compositions. According to a detailed guide from Elegant Themes, this feature has become indispensable for photographers needing to adjust compositions without reshooting.

Beyond Generative Fill, the introduction of Harmonize and Generative Upscale in the desktop version marks a pivotal shift. Harmonize intelligently matches colors and lighting across different image elements, ensuring cohesive results in composite work. Generative Upscale, on the other hand, enhances image resolution while preserving details, which is crucial for print professionals dealing with low-res assets. These tools, as highlighted in Adobe’s official release notes on their help site, are designed to save hours in post-production.

Elevating Precision with Conversational Editing

The integration of conversational editing represents another leap forward, allowing users to describe changes in natural language for AI to execute. This feature, rolled out in late 2025, enables phrases like “make the sky more dramatic” to trigger adjustments in exposure, contrast, and color grading. Industry insiders note that this reduces the learning curve for complex edits, making Photoshop more accessible to multidisciplinary teams. A recent analysis from ZDNET emphasizes how this tool democratizes high-level editing for non-experts.

Complementing these is the enhanced Neural Filters suite, which now includes advanced options like Style Transfer and Portrait Enhancer. Style Transfer applies artistic styles from reference images, ideal for concept artists iterating on visual themes. The Portrait Enhancer uses AI to refine facial features, smoothing skin and adjusting lighting with minimal manual input. As per a step-by-step tutorial in Creative Studios Derby, these filters are particularly valuable in fashion and advertising, where quick turnarounds are essential.

Moreover, Photoshop’s collaboration with third-party AI models expands creative possibilities. Users can now switch to models like Flux or Nano Banana for Generative Fill, each excelling in specific scenarios—Flux for realistic textures and Nano Banana for stylized outputs. This flexibility, detailed in an article from Digital Camera World, allows professionals to tailor AI assistance to project needs, from photorealistic renders to abstract designs.

Integration with Broader Ecosystems and Workflows

A groundbreaking development is Photoshop’s embedding within ChatGPT, announced in December 2025. This integration lets users edit images conversationally without leaving the chat interface, handling tasks like background removal or PDF modifications. No subscription is required for basic features, broadening access. CNET reports that this addresses common frustrations in AI editing, such as iterative refinements, by enabling real-time feedback loops.

This ChatGPT tie-in extends to Adobe Express and Acrobat, facilitating seamless workflows across apps. For example, a designer can generate an image in Photoshop via ChatGPT, then incorporate it into a PDF presentation. TechCrunch covered this rollout in depth, noting in their piece on TechCrunch how it empowers users to animate elements or modify documents through prompts, streamlining content creation for marketers and educators.

On the performance side, updates in Photoshop 2025 include AI-driven optimization for hardware acceleration, ensuring smoother operation on diverse devices. This is especially beneficial for remote teams using cloud-based workflows. The Photoshop Training Channel outlines how these enhancements reduce lag in large-scale projects, a boon for film and game industry professionals handling high-resolution assets.

Practical Tutorials and Real-World Applications

To harness these tools effectively, insiders recommend starting with tutorials that break down each feature. For Generative Fill, select an area, input a prompt, and let AI generate variations—refine with masks for precision. A comprehensive walkthrough from Aela.io demonstrates how this accelerates ideation in product design, where rapid mockups are key.

For conversational editing, integrate it into daily routines by combining it with layer management. Professionals in e-commerce photography use it to batch-process product images, adjusting lighting uniformly across sets. Lifehacker’s hands-on test, as shared in their article on Lifehacker, reveals that while initial results impress, iterative prompting yields professional-grade outcomes.

Industry sentiment, gleaned from posts on X, reflects excitement mixed with cautious optimism. Users praise the time savings but debate AI’s role in creativity, with some viewing it as a replacement for traditional skills. One viral thread highlighted how these tools could “flip the design industry,” echoing broader discussions on AI’s disruptive potential without confirming wholesale job displacement.

Ethical Considerations and Future Trajectories

As AI permeates Photoshop, ethical questions arise, particularly around authenticity and bias in generated content. Insiders must navigate copyright implications when using AI-trained on vast datasets. Adobe addresses this by emphasizing ethical AI development in Firefly, trained on licensed images. Google’s AI updates blog, in a post on Google’s blog, parallels this by discussing breakthroughs in responsible AI, offering a comparative view for Photoshop users.

Looking ahead, integrations like third-party models suggest a trend toward modular AI ecosystems. This could lead to specialized plugins for niches like medical imaging or architectural visualization. The Reddit community, in discussions on Reddit, debates opting for pre-AI versions, underscoring a divide between purists and adopters.

For insiders, mastering these tools involves balancing AI assistance with human ingenuity. Workshops and certifications are emerging to train on ethical usage, ensuring AI enhances rather than supplants creativity. As one X post noted, these features save “hundreds of hours,” allowing focus on conceptual work.

Case Studies from Industry Leaders

Real-world applications illuminate AI’s impact. In advertising, agencies use Generative Upscale to repurpose archival photos for high-definition campaigns, maintaining quality without original files. A case from the fashion sector, as per industry reports, shows Portrait Enhancer cutting retouching time by 70%, enabling faster seasonal lookbooks.

Film post-production benefits from Harmonize, syncing visual effects across frames seamlessly. VFX artists report improved efficiency in compositing CGI with live footage. Drawing from Google’s research breakthroughs detailed on their blog, similar AI advancements in image editing hint at cross-pollination between tech giants, potentially influencing future Photoshop updates.

Educators and trainers are incorporating these tools into curricula, teaching students to leverage AI for innovation. Online platforms offer courses that simulate professional scenarios, preparing the next generation for an AI-augmented field.

Navigating Challenges and Best Practices

Despite advantages, challenges persist, such as AI hallucinations where generated elements don’t align perfectly. Best practices include verifying outputs with manual tweaks and using reference images for guidance. Insiders recommend versioning files to track AI interventions, maintaining transparency in collaborative projects.

Hardware considerations are key; while cloud processing handles heavy lifts, local setups benefit from GPUs for real-time edits. Adobe’s updates optimize for this, but users should monitor system requirements.

Community feedback on X underscores the need for ongoing tutorials, with users sharing tips on optimizing prompts for better results. This collective knowledge base enriches the ecosystem, fostering innovation.

Strategic Implications for Professionals

For industry leaders, adopting these AI features strategically positions firms ahead of competitors. Integrating them into pipelines can reduce costs and accelerate deliverables, crucial in fast-paced sectors like social media content creation.

Looking to 2026, rumors suggest deeper AI personalization, perhaps predictive editing based on user history. This could revolutionize bespoke design services.

Ultimately, Photoshop’s AI evolution empowers creators to focus on vision over mechanics, heralding a new era of digital artistry where technology amplifies human potential. As tools mature, the line between creator and creation blurs, inviting endless possibilities.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-5199-1767142358.jpeg,N,,2025-12-31 08:12:50.957913

But for generations of business leaders, the 95-year-old has also served as something else: a teacher.
As the iconic investor steps down from his post, several business leaders told CNN about the lessons Buffett leaves behind.
“From Warren Buffett, I’ve learned that excellence really is a discipline,” said Larry Restieri, CEO at wealth management firm Hightower.
“When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,” Buffett wrote in 2025.","(CNN) — Warren Buffett has worn many hats over the years: The stock-picking Oracle of Omaha. An avuncular, Dairy-Queen-eating, Coke-drinking product pitchman. A living symbol of capitalism and its complexities.

But for generations of business leaders, the 95-year-old has also served as something else: a teacher.

Buffett’s combination of success and sagacity has made him one of the most famous investors in the world, “on the Mount Rushmore of business leaders in our country,” Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said. And through his advice-packed investor letters, his hourslong quote-fest annual meetings, his choices at work or in his personal life, Buffett has taught CEOs and executives around the world how to run their businesses and, in many cases, their lives.

Buffett, who’s spent much of his life among the top 10 richest people in the world, is stepping down Wednesday as head of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway; protégé Greg Abel will take the reins Thursday.

As the iconic investor steps down from his post, several business leaders told CNN about the lessons Buffett leaves behind.

‘Predicting rain doesn’t count’

As a journalist, I’ve covered countless earnings reports. None were as fun as Berkshire Hathaway’s, in large part because Buffett remains among the business world’s top communicators.

He said what he meant, and he never used a 10-cent word if a one-cent word would do. And he was flat-out funny in a way that made covering him a hoot.

“What I’ve always admired about Warren Buffett, and (his late business partner) Charlie Munger for that matter, is their use of plain English and plain language to explain difficult concepts,” Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, said. “It takes a lot of skill to take a complex issue and just split it to the bare minimum.”

Their dry wit made “their shareholder letter one of my favorite reads,” he added.

Some gems among those shareholder letters:

“It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.”“Predicting rain doesn’t count; building arks does.”“I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box.’”

‘Our favorite holding period is forever’

One theme among the CEOs who spoke to CNN: Buffett’s legendary patience. Buffett was known to sit on ginormous piles of cash at Berkshire, waiting for the right opportunity to invest. And when he did invest, he was in it for the long haul: “our favorite holding period is forever,” he wrote to shareholders in 1989.

Investor, podcaster, entrepreneur and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci wrote to Buffett 30 years ago, saying he was buying Berkshire shares for his daughter.

“And since she was one and a half years old with a life expectancy of 84 years, she had 82 and a half years left in which to hold her stock,” Scaramucci said.

“He wrote back very quickly and said that was a manifestation of short-termism. His own intention was to hold the stock for a hundred years.”

‘I will be ruthless’

Yes, Buffett was a shark who made billions of dollars off Goldman Sachs, among the most hardcore capitalists on the planet.

But he was a shark with ethics.

“From Warren Buffett, I’ve learned that excellence really is a discipline,” said Larry Restieri, CEO at wealth management firm Hightower. “Set a clear direction, stay true to your principles and execute patiently.”

Buffett racked up a net worth around $150 billion, according to Bloomberg, but he always emphasized honesty and integrity.

And he expected the same from every single person who worked with him: “Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless,” he once testified before Congress.

‘A vast collection of possessions ends up possessing its owner’

Buffett famously loves flying private. He is a Cadillac fan. He is uber-wealthy, and he makes no apologies for it.

But he has also decided to pass on some of his massive riches. Buffett, along with Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, created the Giving Pledge in 2010 for the world’s richest people to promise “to give the majority of their wealth to charitable causes in their lifetime or wills.”

Marcel Arsenault, the CEO of Real Capital Solutions, is one of the people who signed that pledge. “Warren inspired me to think beyond monetary success,” he told CNN.

In a letter explaining his commitment, Buffett wrote: “Too often, a vast collection of possessions ends up possessing its owner.”

But giving doesn’t have to be about piles of cash.

“When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,” Buffett wrote in 2025. “Kindness is costless but also priceless.”

Sampoerna Tbk right now – and that might be the whole opportunity. You have a low-key Indonesian tobacco giant plugged into one of the biggest cigarette companies on the planet, quietly throwing off cash while everyone else chases the next AI meme stock.

So, is PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk actually worth your money, or is this just another slow, dusty value play your friend who “loves dividends” keeps talking about?

Let's talk hype, real numbers, and whether this is a cop or drop.

The Hype is Real: PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk on TikTok and Beyond

Here's the real talk: PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is not trending on your For You Page like Nvidia, Tesla, or whatever meme coin just rug-pulled your feed. But tobacco stocks live in a weird lane: low clout, high cash.

You're not seeing people flex Sampoerna shares on TikTok, but you are seeing creators talk about dividend plays, “boring but rich” stocks, and global income portfolios. That's exactly where a company like this sneaks in.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch viral TikTok reviews of PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk

Watch honest tests on YouTube

Right now the “clout” level is low-key. That doesn't mean it's a flop. It just means this is more “quiet money” than “viral flex.”

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let's break down PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk from a US retail investor point of view: worth the hype or nah?

1. The Stock Price Reality Check

Using live market data from multiple financial sources, PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk (ticker usually listed as HMSP on the Indonesia Stock Exchange) most recently traded on the Indonesia market at a price reflecting a modest daily move, with the latest available figure based on the last market close. As of the latest verified data pull on the current date, after cross-checking two separate finance feeds, the stock is basically moving in a tight range with no wild meme-style spikes.

Important: The Indonesia Stock Exchange is outside US hours, so you're mostly looking at last close data when you check it during the US trading day. No guessing, no hype math.

What matters more: this is a dividend-heavy, slow-mover type of play, not a “double in a week” lottery ticket.

2. The Business Model: Cash Machine, Not Trend Machine

PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is a major cigarette producer in Indonesia, tied to Philip Morris International. Translation: they sell a product a lot of regulators hate but millions still buy daily.

Key angles for you:

Cash flow: Tobacco companies are known for strong, consistent cash, even when growth is flat.

Dividends: Historically, this type of stock is all about paying out to shareholders. You don't buy it to brag; you buy it to collect.

Risk: Regulatory pressure and smoking decline trends are always in the background, which is why many investors put these stocks in the “high-yield but controversial” bucket.

If you're here for fast growth, it might feel like a flop. If you're here for slow, steady income, this lane can be a quiet win.

3. The “Is It Worth the Hype?” Test

On social, people scream about AI, EVs, and crypto. PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk fails the viral test on purpose. Its vibe is more:

Low volatility vs. meme spikes

Dividends vs. crazy capital gains

Emerging market exposure vs. pure US tech plays

So is it a game-changer? Not in the “new technology” sense. But in a diversified portfolio, for someone who wants global cash-flow assets, it can absolutely be a quiet must-have.

PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk vs. The Competition

You can't judge this stock in a vacuum. The real rivalry is Sampoerna vs other giants in the tobacco and nicotine world.

Global Rivals: Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Altria

Big global names like Philip Morris International (PM), British American Tobacco (BTI), and Altria (MO) dominate US investor attention. They trade in New York, they show up on US broker apps instantly, and they get way more social chatter.

How Sampoerna stacks up:

Clout: Global giants win. Their tickers are everywhere, they get analyst coverage, and they get dragged into every “sin stock” debate thread.

Access: US stocks are easier for American retail investors to tap into than a single-name Indonesian listing.

Local edge: PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is laser-focused on Indonesia, one of the world's biggest cigarette markets. Local dominance vs global spread.

Who Wins the Clout War?

If we're talking pure viral potential, the winner is the global names. More people search them, more TikToks mention them, and more YouTube creators review their dividends and “sin stock” strategies.

But if the question is: where can a patient investor potentially find under-the-radar value? Sampoerna has a shot. While everyone fights over the same US tickers, this one sits in the “know if you know” zone.

So in a clout contest, Sampoerna loses. In a “quiet, cash-focused, emerging market tobacco” niche? It absolutely holds its own.

The Business Side: Sampoerna

Here's where it gets serious. PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is tied to the ISIN ID1000070105, listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. That ISIN is your unique ID tag for this exact stock. No confusion, no ticker mix-ups.

From a fundamentals angle, you're looking at:

Sector: Tobacco and cigarettes, a classic “sin stock” space.

Market: Indonesia, one of the largest cigarette markets in the world.

Structure: Connected to a global player (Philip Morris International) but operating as a local champion.

On the price-performance side, recent trading action has been more about small percentage moves around the last close than huge breakouts. That fits the profile: this is a defensive, income-tilted stock, not a moonshot.

Also, remember: if you're in the US, you're dealing with:

FX risk: Indonesian rupiah vs US dollar.

Access issues: You may need a broker that supports foreign markets or depository receipts, depending on how you want exposure.

Regulation and ethics: Tobacco is always under fire. Some funds avoid it completely; others lean in for yield.

The move here is not “ape in.” It's research, compare, size carefully.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let's keep it blunt.

If you want a viral stock you can brag about on TikTok, this is a drop. There's no flashy tech, no meme army, no overnight x10 fantasy.

If you want:

Exposure to a major emerging market

A classic dividend and cash flow style play

A “boring but potentially steady” name tied to a global tobacco giant

Then PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk can absolutely be a cop — if you:

Understand the ethical and regulatory baggage around tobacco

Accept currency and emerging market risk

Are cool with “slow and steady” instead of trying to go viral with your portfolio

Is it a game-changer? Not in the culture sense. Is it potentially a smart, under-hyped income piece in a global portfolio? That's where it quietly wins.

Real talk: this is not for everyone. But if you're building a serious, mixed-asset portfolio and not just chasing the next meme, PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk deserves at least a spot on your watchlist.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404990_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:01:30.124222

You know HP Inc. as the printer and laptop brand that’s been in your life since school. But right now, its stock is doing the ""wait, how is this up again?"" move that has Wall Street and TikTok quietly paying attention.

While everyone is chasing the loud AI names, HP Inc. (ticker: HPQ) is running a different play: steady profits, massive buybacks, chunky dividends, and a sneaky AI PC angle that could flip the script on what ""boring"" looks like in your portfolio.

So let’s talk real talk: is HP Inc. a must-have money play right now, or a value trap dressed up as a comeback story?

The Hype is Real: HP Inc. on TikTok and Beyond

HP isn’t the flashiest brand on your For You Page, but it’s absolutely in the mix. From budget creators shopping for study laptops to small businesses rage-posting about printer ink prices, HP content is everywhere – and it’s surprisingly positive.

Creators are calling out HP for one thing: solid performance for the price. Not the sexiest flex, but when you’re buying gear to actually get stuff done, that hits.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch viral TikTok reviews of HP Inc.

Watch honest tests on YouTube

From unboxings of budget HP laptops to side-by-side tests against way pricier machines, the vibe is the same: ""Did I just pay way less and still get a legit setup?""

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let’s strip this down. When you look at HP Inc. right now, three things really matter: price, AI, and cash flow.

1. The Stock Price Move: Sneaky Strong

On the market side, HP Inc. trades under the ticker HPQ in the US. Based on live data pulled from major financial platforms, HPQ is sitting around the mid-$30s per share, with the latest quoted price and performance coming from real-time sources like Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch. As of the most recent market session, the numbers show the stock holding comfortably in that range, with the last close slightly below the live quote when markets were active. Exact intraday ticks change constantly, but here’s the real talk: HP has been drifting higher over recent months instead of collapsing like a dying hardware dinosaur.

That matters. In a market where hype names spike and crash, HP is acting like a slow-burn compounder: not viral, but not dead money either.

2. AI PCs: The ""Wait, HP Does That Too?"" Angle

HP isn’t trying to be the next pure AI software god. Instead, it’s doing something more practical: AI-powered PCs and creator-focused laptops. Think machines optimized for on-device AI tasks, better battery, smoother video calls, faster content workflows.

Is it a game-changer? For you as a buyer, it can be. HP’s AI-focused laptops and workstations are positioned as ""do more with less"" tools: fewer lags, more multitasking, video, editing, streaming, and school or work in the same box without meltdown.

If HP sticks the landing here, it turns into the quiet backbone of the AI hardware world – not the brand trending every day, but the gear behind a ton of content, work, and small-business setups.

3. Cash Machine Mode: Dividends and Buybacks

This is the part that doesn’t go viral on TikTok but absolutely matters for your portfolio. HP Inc. throws off serious cash flow and sends a lot of it back to shareholders. We’re talking a steady dividend yield that’s actually noticeable, plus aggressive stock buybacks that shrink the share count over time.

Translation: HP is literally using its own cash to boost the value of each share you own. If you’re into long-term stacking instead of day-trading chaos, this is not a flop move. It’s the ""quietly getting rich"" strategy.

HP Inc. vs. The Competition

In your actual shopping cart and in the stock market, HP’s biggest rival is Dell, with Lenovo and Apple lurking in the mix.

HP vs Dell: Who Wins the Clout War?

For clout: Apple wins, obviously. MacBooks will always get more aesthetic desk shots and influencer love.

For ""bang for your buck"" PCs: That’s where HP and Dell go head-to-head.

HP: Strong in consumer laptops, Chromebooks, student devices, and SMB printers. Feels more ""everyday user"" and content-creator friendly at midrange prices.

Dell: Big in corporate fleets and work setups. XPS line has serious respect with power users, but prices can climb fast.

On the stock side, both HP and Dell lean into buybacks and dividends. The difference is perception: Dell gets more ""serious enterprise"" respect, while HP feels like the accessible brand you’ve actually owned.

So who wins? If you want pure clout, you go Apple. If you want a realistic, affordable setup that gets the job done without nuking your budget, HP is absolutely in the ""worth the hype"" lane right now – especially for students, creators, and side-hustlers.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s answer it straight: Is HP Inc. a cop or a drop?

As a product brand: HP is a solid cop if you care more about value and performance than flexing. The laptops and printers may not trend every week, but real users keep buying them because they work and they’re priced to move. For a lot of people, that’s a game-changer.

As a stock (HPQ): HP is a quiet cop for long-term thinkers, not short-term moon-chasers. You’re not getting the explosive AI meme-stock story, but you are getting:

A stock that hasn’t totally blown up in price yet.

Cash coming back to you through dividends and buybacks.

Exposure to the AI PC wave without paying AI-bubble prices.

If your vibe is ""set it, watch it, and let compounding do its thing,"" HP looks more like a no-brainer value play than a flop. If you only want hyper-viral, triple-digit growth stories, you’ll probably find HP too chill for your taste.

Real talk: HP Inc. sits in that underrated zone where the social media chatter is modest, the numbers are grown-up, and the upside comes from patience, not panic-buying.

The Business Side: HP Inc. Aktie

For anyone watching the company as a global stock play, HP Inc. is also traded as an ""Aktie"" on international markets, tied to the ISIN US40434L1052. That code is basically the universal ID for HP Inc. shares across borders.

Here’s what matters from a market-watch angle:

Stability over drama: HP’s financials lean into predictable hardware demand, recurring printer supplies, and services. Less meme, more math.

AI as an upgrade cycle: As AI PCs and next-gen laptops roll out, HP gets a shot at a major refresh cycle. Every time people replace old devices with AI-optimized ones, HP has a chance to grab more share.

Shareholder returns: Dividends and buybacks mean that even if growth is mid, total return can still be strong.

The catch? This is not a zero-to-hero story. HP’s upside is tied to execution: staying relevant in laptops, keeping printers profitable, and not getting steamrolled by Apple, Dell, or the next wave of AI hardware challengers.

If you want exposure to the everyday tech that actually powers offices, schools, and home setups – not just the buzziest headlines – HP Inc. Aktie (ISIN US40434L1052) is absolutely worth a look.

Bottom line: HP Inc. might never dominate your feed, but it might quietly boost your net worth. And in a market full of hype, that low-key might be the real game-changer.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405055_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 07:13:22.211437

With economic growth projected between 2.0-2.5%, a steepening yield curve, accelerating loan growth, and easing regulatory burdens, bank stocks appear poised for outperformance.

RBC Capital Markets highlights several key drivers for the sector’s robust outlook, including increased Commercial & Industrial lending, Commercial Real Estate financing, and home equity lending. Elevated M&A activity is also expected to benefit the industry.

However, the analysis warns that re-emerging inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to shift monetary policy, potentially leading to higher interest rates that could impact the sector.

Based on RBC’s assessment, here are the top U.S. bank stocks to watch:

Bank of America is highlighted by RBC as well positioned to capitalize on the favorable banking environment projected for 2026.

Bank of America, along with Goldman Sachs, is leading a group of investors in the Texas Stock Exchange. The bank was also part of a group that shelved a planned $20 billion bailout for Argentina in favor of a smaller, short-term loan package.

Popular

is also among RBC’s preferred banks, demonstrating strong fundamentals that align with the positive sector outlook.

Popular Inc. recently reported third-quarter 2025 earnings that surpassed EPS expectations, though revenue slightly missed forecasts. The company also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share on its common stock.

Citigroup is included in RBC’s list of banks expected to benefit from accelerating loan growth and a steepening yield curve.

Citigroup received an upgrade from JPMorgan to Overweight from Neutral, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency terminated an amendment to a 2020 consent order. In addition, Citibank announced it would reduce its base lending rate to 6.75%.

First Horizon Corporation is cited by RBC as a bank positioned to perform well in a robust 2026 environment.

First Horizon Corporation’s board authorized a new $1.2 billion common stock repurchase program and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.

The company also received an initiation of coverage with a Buy rating from Deutsche Bank, while Baird downgraded the stock to Neutral.

Fifth Third Bancorp is viewed positively by RBC as regulatory burdens ease and commercial lending accelerates.

Fifth Third Bancorp recently reported third-quarter 2025 results that beat both earnings and revenue forecasts. The company also announced upcoming board changes and received a price target increase from TD Cowen.

Huntington Bancshares Incorporated is among the banks RBC expects to benefit from projected economic growth.

Huntington Bancshares received a price target increase from RBC Capital and announced it would lower its prime rate to 6.75 percent. The bank also appointed Marc Dizard as chief investment officer for its Wealth Management division.

KeyCorp is highlighted by RBC as an institution positioned to capitalize on favorable banking conditions.

KeyCorp announced a reduction in its prime lending rate to 6.75 percent and received a price target increase from DA Davidson. The company also disclosed it will redeem all of its outstanding 4.700% Fixed Rate Senior Bank Notes due January 2026.

M&T Bank Corporation is included among RBC’s favored banks, positioned for potential outperformance.

M&T Bank Corporation reported third-quarter 2025 earnings that surpassed analyst expectations for earnings per share. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share on its common stock and reduced its prime lending rate.

The PNC Financial Services Group is viewed by RBC as having strong potential in the positive banking environment forecast for 2026.

The PNC Financial Services Group has received all required regulatory approvals to complete its acquisition of FirstBank Holding Company. Separately, PNC Bank announced it would reduce its prime lending rate to 6.75%.

Truist Financial Corporation is also included in RBC’s group of top U.S. banks, expected to benefit from loan growth and M&A activity.

Truist Financial Corporation announced its board has authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program. The company also launched a new digital wealth management platform and received a rating downgrade to Neutral from Baird.

RBC also highlighted , , , , and as additional bank stocks it favors within its constructive outlook for the sector.

The analysis emphasizes that continued economic growth and the steepening yield curve should create favorable conditions for these institutions, though investors should remain watchful for inflation signals that could alter the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy trajectory.

Victory Pioneer Disciplined Growth Fund (the “Fund”)

Supplement to the Fund’s Prospectus dated December 31, 2025, as in effect and as may be amended from time to time.

On September 30, 2025, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, upon the recommendation of Victory Capital Management Inc., the Fund’s investment adviser (“Victory Capital”), approved a change in the Fund’s custodian, sub-administrator, sub-fund accountant, and transfer agent to be effective close of business on or about February 6, 2026 (the “Effective Date”).

As of the Effective Date, FIS Investor Services LLC (“FIS”) will serve as transfer agent of the Fund. In connection with this change and following the Effective Date, shareholders may be able to reduce or eliminate the sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund through a letter of intent or right of accumulation that includes other funds not managed by Victory Capital, in addition to funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise. Moreover, shares of a Fund, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of the same class of another fund in the Victory Funds mutual fund complex, including funds that are not managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise.

Prior to the Effective Date, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund’s transfer agent. Until the Effective Date, all references in the Prospectus to FIS Investor Services LLC as the Fund’s transfer agent are deleted and replaced with references to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

Prior to the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-225-6292. After the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-539-FUND (1-800-539-3863).

Until the Effective Date, the following modifies (and if inconsistent, replaces) the information appearing in the Letter of Intent and Right of Accumulation bullet points of the Prospectus section “Choosing a Share Class”:

Letter of Intent - If you anticipate purchasing $50,000 or more of Class A shares of the Fund, including any purchase of other funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise (each, a “Victory Pioneer Fund”) of any share class (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans), within a 13-month period, you may qualify for a sales charge breakpoint as though you were investing the total amount in one lump sum. In order to qualify for the reduced sales charge, you must submit a non- binding Letter of Intent (the “Letter”) within 90 days of the start of the purchases. Each investment you make after signing the Letter will be entitled to the sales charge applicable to the total investment indicated in the Letter. You must start with a minimum initial investment of at least 5.00% of the total amount you intend to purchase. A portion of the shares purchased under the Letter will be held in escrow until the total investment has been completed. In the event you do not complete your commitment set forth in the Letter in the time period specified, sufficient escrowed shares will be redeemed to pay any applicable front-end sales charges;

Right of Accumulation - Whereas a Letter of Intent allows you to qualify for a discount by combining your current purchase amount with purchases you intend to make in the near future, a Right of Accumulation allows you to reduce the initial sales charge on a Class A investment by combining the amount of your current purchase with the current market value of prior investments made by you, your spouse (including domestic partner), and your

children under age 21 in any class of shares of any Victory Pioneer Fund (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans). The value of eligible existing holdings will be calculated by using the greater of the current value or the original investment amount. To ensure that you receive a reduced price using the Fund’s Right of Accumulation, you or your Investment Professional must inform the Funds that the Right applies each time shares are purchased and provide sufficient information to permit confirmation of qualification;

In addition, the following policies regarding Buying, Exchanging and Selling Shares remain in force until the Effective Date.

The Fund may close your account if we cannot adequately verify your identity. The redemption price will be the net asset value on the date of redemption.

Investing Through Financial Intermediaries and Retirement Plans

If you invest in the Fund through your financial intermediary or through a retirement plan, the options and services available to you may be different from those discussed in this

prospectus. Shareholders investing through financial intermediaries, programs sponsored by financial intermediaries and retirement plans may only purchase funds and classes of shares that are available. When you invest through an account that is not in your name, you generally may buy and sell shares and complete other transactions only through the account. Ask your investment professional or financial intermediary for more information.

Additional conditions may apply to your investment in the Fund, and the investment professional or intermediary may charge you a transaction-based, administrative or other fee for its services. These conditions and fees are in addition to those imposed by the Fund and its affiliates. You should ask your investment professional or financial intermediary about its services and any applicable fees.

Share Prices for Transactions

If you place an order to purchase, exchange or sell shares that is received in good order by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent by the close of regular trading on the NYSE (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), the share price for your transaction will be based on the net asset value determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on that day (plus or minus any applicable sales charges). If your order is received by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent after the close of regular trading on the NYSE, or your order is not in good order, the share price will be based on the net asset value next determined after your order is received in good order by the Fund or authorized agent. The authorized agent is responsible for transmitting your order to the Fund in a timely manner.

Good order means that:

■You have provided adequate instructions

■There are no outstanding claims against your account

■There are no transaction limitations on your account

■Your request includes a signature guarantee if you:

■Are selling over $100,000 or exchanging over $500,000 worth of shares

■Changed your account registration or address within the last 30 days

■Instruct the transfer agent to mail the check to an address different from the one on your account

■Want the check paid to someone other than the account’s record owner(s)

■Are transferring the sale proceeds to a Victory Fund account with a different registration

Transaction Limitations

Your transactions are subject to certain limitations, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of a redemption.

Buying

You may buy Fund shares from any financial intermediary that has a sales agreement or other arrangement with the Distributor.

You can buy shares at net asset value per share plus any applicable sales charge. The Distributor may reject any order until it has confirmed the order in writing and received payment. Normally, your financial intermediary will send your purchase request to the Fund’s transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

Minimum Investment Amounts

If you would like to buy Class A or Class C shares, the minimum investment required to open an account is $2,500 ($1,000 for IRA accounts), with additional investments of at least $50. If you would like to buy Class R6, Class R, or Class Y shares, you must be an Eligible Investor, as discussed in the section Choosing a Share Class — Eligibility Requirements to Purchase. Eligible Investors may be subject to a minimum investment amount as detailed in that section.

For Class C shares, individual purchases of $250,000 and above will be made automatically in Class A shares.

If your account falls below the minimum investment amount, we may ask you to reestablish the minimum investment. If you do not do so within 60 days, we may close your account and send you the value of your account.

The minimum investment required to open an account may be waived or lowered for employees and immediate family members of the employees, of the Adviser, the Administrator, and their affiliates. In addition, the minimum investment required may be waived when the Fund is purchased through an Advisory Program, within qualified retirement plans or in other similar circumstances. Although the Fund may sometimes waive the minimum investment, when it does so, it always reserves the right to reject initial investments under the minimum at its discretion.

How to Buy Shares

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your purchase request to the Distributor and/or transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

By Phone or Online

You can use the telephone or online purchase privilege if you have an existing non- retirement account. Certain IRAs can use the telephone purchase privilege. If your account is eligible, you can purchase additional Fund shares by phone or online if:

■Your bank information has not changed for at least 30 days

■You are not purchasing more than $100,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

When you request a telephone or online purchase, the Fund’s transfer agent will electronically debit the amount of the purchase from your bank account of record. The Fund’s transfer agent will purchase Fund shares for the amount of the debit at the offering price determined after the Fund’s transfer agent receives your telephone or online purchase instruction and good funds. It usually takes three business days for the Fund’s transfer agent to receive notification from your bank that good funds are available in the amount of your investment.

In Writing, by Mail

You can purchase Fund shares for an existing Fund account by mailing a check to the Fund. Make your check payable to the Fund. Neither initial nor subsequent investments should be made by third party check, travelers check, or credit card check. Your check must be in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank.

If you have an existing (Class R6 or Class Y shares only) account, you may wire funds to purchase shares. Note, however, that:

How to Exchange Shares

You may, under certain circumstances, exchange your shares for shares of the same class of another Victory Pioneer Fund. At this time, shares of a Victory Pioneer Fund may only be exchanged for the same share class of another Victory Pioneer Fund.

Your exchange request must be for at least $1,000. The Fund allows you to exchange your shares at net asset value without charging you either an initial or contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange. Shares you acquire as part of an exchange will continue to be subject to any contingent deferred sales charge that applies to the shares you originally purchased. When you ultimately sell your shares, the date of your original purchase will determine your contingent deferred sales charge.

Before you request an exchange, consider each fund’s investment objective(s) and policies as described in the Fund’s prospectus. You generally will have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Same-Fund Exchange Privilege

Certain shareholders may be eligible to exchange their shares for shares of another class. If eligible, no sales charges or other charges will apply to any such exchange. Generally, shareholders will not recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes upon such an exchange. Investors should contact their financial intermediary to learn more about the details of this privilege.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your exchange request to the Fund’s transfer agent.

Consult your investment professional for more information about exchanging your shares.

By Phone or Online

After you establish an eligible fund account, you can exchange Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You are exchanging into an existing account or using the exchange to establish a new account, provided the new account has a registration identical to the original account

■The Fund into which you are exchanging offers the same class of shares

You can exchange Fund shares by mailing or faxing a letter of instruction to the Fund. You can exchange Fund shares directly through the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. However, you may not fax an exchange request for more than $500,000. Include in your letter:

■The name and signature of all registered owners

■A signature guarantee for each registered owner if the amount of the exchange is more than $500,000

■The name of the Fund out of which you are exchanging and the name of the Fund into which you are exchanging

■The class of shares you are exchanging

■The dollar amount or number of shares you are exchanging

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of exchange requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

How to Sell Shares

Your shares will be sold at the share price (net asset value less any applicable sales charge) next calculated after the Fund or its authorized agent, such as a broker-dealer, receives your request in good order. If a signature guarantee is required, you must submit your request in writing.

If the shares you are selling are subject to a deferred sales charge, it will be deducted from the sale proceeds. The Fund generally will send your sale proceeds by check, bank wire or electronic funds transfer. Your redemption proceeds normally will be sent within 1 business

day after your request is received in good order, but in any event within 7 days, regardless of the method the Fund uses to make such payment. If you recently sent a check to purchase the shares being sold, the Fund may delay payment of the sale proceeds until your check has cleared. This may take up to 10 calendar days from the purchase date.

Your redemption proceeds may be delayed, or your right to receive redemption proceeds suspended, if the NYSE is closed (other than on weekends or holidays) or trading is restricted, if the SEC determines an emergency or other circumstances exist that make it impracticable for the Fund to sell or value its portfolio securities, or otherwise as permitted by the rules of or by the order of the SEC.

If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account or certain IRAs, you may use any of the methods described below. If you are selling shares from a retirement account other than an IRA, you must make your request in writing.

You generally will have to pay income taxes on a sale.

If you must use a written request to exchange or sell your shares and your account is registered in the name of a corporation or other fiduciary you must include the name of an authorized person and a certified copy of a current corporate resolution, certificate of incumbency or similar legal document showing that the named individual is authorized to act on behalf of the record owner.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to meet redemption requests by using cash or cash equivalents in its portfolio and/or selling portfolio assets to generate cash. Under stressed or abnormal market conditions or circumstances, including circumstances adversely affecting the liquidity of the Fund’s investments, the Fund may be more likely to be forced to sell portfolio assets to meet redemptions than under normal market circumstances. Under such circumstances, the Fund could be forced to liquidate assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value. The Fund also may pay redemption proceeds using cash obtained through a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility, or an interfund lending facility, if available, and other borrowing arrangements that may be available from time to time.

The Fund reserves the right to redeem in kind, that is, to pay all or a portion of your redemption proceeds by giving you securities. If the Fund redeems in kind, it generally will deliver to you a proportionate share of the portfolio securities owned by the Fund. Securities you receive this way may increase or decrease in value while you hold them and you may incur brokerage and transaction charges and tax liability when you convert the securities to cash. The Fund may redeem in kind at a shareholder’s request or if, for example, the Fund reasonably believes that a cash redemption may have a substantial impact on the Fund and its remaining shareholders.

During periods of deteriorating or stressed market conditions, when an increased portion of the Fund’s portfolio may be comprised of less-liquid investments, or during extraordinary or emergency circumstances, the Fund may be more likely to pay redemption proceeds with cash obtained through short-term borrowing arrangements (if available) or by giving you securities.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your request to sell shares to the Fund’s transfer agent. Please note that your investment firm may have its own earlier deadlines for the receipt of a request to sell shares. Consult your investment professional for more information. The Fund has authorized the Distributor to act as its agent in the repurchase of Fund shares

from qualified investment firms. The Fund reserves the right to terminate this procedure at any time.

By Phone or Online

If you have an eligible non-retirement account, you may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by phone or online. You may sell Fund shares held in a retirement plan account by phone only if your account is an eligible IRA (tax penalties may apply). You may not sell your shares by phone or online if you have changed your address (for checks) or your bank information (for wires and transfers) in the last 30 days.

You may receive your sale proceeds:

■By check, provided the check is made payable exactly as your account is registered

■By bank wire or by electronic funds transfer, provided the sale proceeds are being sent to your bank address of record

For Class Y shares, shareholders may sell up to $5 million per account per day if the proceeds are directed to your bank account of record ($100,000 per account per day if the proceeds are not directed to your bank account of record).

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can sell some or all of your Fund shares by writing directly to the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. Include in your request your name, the Fund’s name, your Fund account number, the class of shares to be sold, the dollar amount or number of shares to be sold and any other applicable requirements as described below. The Fund’s transfer agent will send the sale proceeds to your address of record unless you provide other instructions. Your request must be signed by all registered owners and be in good order.

The Fund’s transfer agent will not process your request until it is received in good order. You may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by fax.

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of redemption requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

In addition, the following policies regarding Account Options remain in force until the Effective Date.

Account Options

See the account application form for more details on each of the following services or call the Fund for details and availability.

Telephone Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you can buy, exchange or sell Fund shares by telephone. If you do not want your account to have telephone transaction privileges, you must indicate that choice on your account application or by writing to the Fund.

When you request a telephone transaction the Fund’s transfer agent will try to confirm that the request is genuine. The transfer agent records the call, requires the caller to provide validating information for the account and sends you a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other confirmation procedures from time to time. Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. If the Fund’s confirmation procedures are followed, neither the Fund nor its agents will bear any liability for these transactions.

Online Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you may be able to buy, exchange or sell Fund shares online. Your investment firm may also be able to buy, exchange or sell your Fund shares online.

To establish online transaction privileges:

■For new accounts, complete the online section of the account application

■For existing accounts, complete an account options form, write to the Fund or complete the online authorization screen at vcm.com

To use online transactions, you must read and agree to the terms of an online transaction agreement available on the Victory Funds website. When you or your investment firm requests an online transaction, the Fund’s transfer agent electronically records the transaction, requires an authorizing password and sends a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other procedures from time to time.

Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. You may not be able to use the online transaction privilege for certain types of accounts, including most retirement accounts.

Periodic Investments

You can make periodic investments in the Fund by setting up monthly bank drafts, government allotments, payroll deductions, or an Automatic Investment Plan.

Periodic investments may be made only through U.S. banks. You may use a periodic investment plan to establish a Class A share account with a small initial investment. If you have a Class C or Class R share account and your balance is at least $1,000, you may establish a periodic investment plan.

Automatic Investment Plan (AIP)

If you establish an Automatic Investment Plan with the Adviser, the Fund’s transfer agent will make a periodic investment in Fund shares by means of a preauthorized electronic Funds transfer from your bank account. Your plan investments are voluntary. You may discontinue your plan at any time or change the plan’s dollar amount, frequency or investment date by calling or writing to the Fund’s transfer agent. You should allow up to 30 days for the Fund’s transfer agent to establish your plan.

Automatic Exchanges

You can automatically exchange your Fund shares for shares of the same class of another Fund in the Victory Funds complex. The automatic exchange will begin on the day you select when you complete the appropriate section of your account application or an account options form. In order to establish automatic exchange:

■You must select exchanges on a monthly or quarterly basis

■Both the originating and receiving accounts must have identical registrations

■The originating account must have a minimum balance of $5,000. You may have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Distribution Options

The Fund offers three distribution options. Any Fund shares you buy by reinvesting distributions will be priced at the applicable net asset value per share.

■Unless you indicate another option on your account application, any dividends and capital gain distributions paid to you by the Fund will automatically be invested in additional Fund shares.

■You may elect to have the amount of any dividends paid to you in cash and any capital gain distributions reinvested in additional shares.

■You may elect to have the full amount of any dividends and/or capital gain distributions paid to you in cash.

Options (2) and (3) are not available to retirement plan accounts or accounts with a current value of less than $500. When electing a cash distribution option, you may only select one destination for the cash distribution portion (i.e., bank account or directed to another mutual fund). The other distribution portion must be reinvested into your current mutual fund account or follow the same cash election.

If your distribution check is returned to the Fund’s transfer agent or you do not cash the check for six months or more, the Fund’s transfer agent may reinvest the amount of the check in your account and automatically change the distribution option on your account to option (1) until you request a different option in writing. If the amount of a distribution check would be less than $25, the Fund may reinvest the amount in additional shares of the Fund instead of sending a check. Additional shares of the Fund will be purchased at the then- current net asset value.

Directed Dividends

You can invest the dividends paid by your Fund accounts in a second Victory Funds account. The value of your second account must be at least $1,000. You may direct the investment of any amount of dividends. There are no fees or charges for directed dividends.

Systematic Withdrawal Plans

When you establish a systematic withdrawal plan for your account, the transfer agent will sell the number of Fund shares you specify on a periodic basis and the proceeds will be paid to you or to any person you select. You must obtain a signature guarantee to direct payments to another person after you have established your systematic withdrawal plan. Payments can be made either by check or by electronic transfer to a U.S. bank account you designate.

To establish a systematic withdrawal plan:

■Your account must have a total value of at least $10,000 when you establish your plan

■You may not request a periodic withdrawal of more than 10% of the value of any

Class C or Class R share account (valued at the time the plan is implemented)

These requirements do not apply to scheduled (Internal Revenue Code Section 72(t) election) or mandatory (required minimum distribution) withdrawals from IRAs and certain retirement plans.

Systematic sales of Fund shares may be taxable transactions for you. While you are making systematic withdrawals from your account, you may pay unnecessary initial sales charges on additional purchases of Class A shares or contingent deferred sales charges.

Direct Deposit

If you elect to take dividends or dividends and capital gain distributions in cash, or if you establish a systematic withdrawal plan, you may choose to have those cash payments deposited directly into your savings, checking or NOW bank account.

Voluntary Tax Withholding

You may have the Fund’s transfer agent withhold 28% of the dividends and capital gain distributions paid from your Fund account (before any reinvestment) and forward the amount withheld to the Internal Revenue Service as a credit against your federal income taxes. Voluntary tax withholding is not available for retirement plan accounts or for accounts subject to backup withholding.

In addition, the following policies regarding Shareholder Services and Policies remain in force until the Effective Date.

Shareholder Services and Policies

Purchases in Kind

You may use securities you own to purchase shares of the Fund provided that the Adviser, in its sole discretion, determines that the securities are consistent with the Fund’s objective and policies and their acquisition is in the best interests of the Fund. If the Fund accepts your securities, they will be valued for purposes of determining the number of Fund shares to be issued to you in the same way the Fund will value the securities for purposes of determining its net asset value. For federal income tax purposes, you may be taxed in the same manner

as if you sold the securities that you use to purchase Fund shares for cash in an amount equal to the value of the Fund shares that you purchase. Your broker may also impose a fee in connection with processing your purchase of Fund shares with securities.

Reinstatement Privilege (Class A shares)

If you recently sold all or part of your Class A shares, you may be able to reinvest all or part of your sale proceeds without a sales charge in Class A shares of any Victory Funds. To qualify for reinstatement:

■You must send a written request to the Fund no more than 90 days after selling your shares and

■The registration of the account in which you reinvest your sale proceeds must be identical to the registration of the account from which you sold your shares.

Purchases pursuant to the reinstatement privilege are subject to limitations on investor transactions, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of redemption.

When you elect reinstatement, you are subject to the provisions outlined in the selected fund’s prospectus, including the Fund’s minimum investment requirement. Your sale proceeds will be reinvested in shares of the Fund at the Class A net asset value per share determined after the Fund receives your written request for reinstatement. You may realize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of your sale of Fund shares, and special tax rules may apply if you elect reinstatement. Consult your tax adviser for more information.

December 31, 2025

Victory Pioneer Disciplined Value Fund (the “Fund”)

Supplement to the Fund’s Prospectus dated December 31, 2025, as in effect and as may be amended from time to time.

On September 30, 2025, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, upon the recommendation of Victory Capital Management Inc., the Fund’s investment adviser (“Victory Capital”), approved a change in the Fund’s custodian, sub-administrator, sub-fund accountant, and transfer agent to be effective close of business on or about February 6, 2026 (the “Effective Date”).

As of the Effective Date, FIS Investor Services LLC (“FIS”) will serve as transfer agent of the Fund. In connection with this change and following the Effective Date, shareholders may be able to reduce or eliminate the sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund through a letter of intent or right of accumulation that includes other funds not managed by Victory Capital, in addition to funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise. Moreover, shares of a Fund, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of the same class of another fund in the Victory Funds mutual fund complex, including funds that are not managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise.

Prior to the Effective Date, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund’s transfer agent. Until the Effective Date, all references in the Prospectus to FIS Investor Services LLC as the Fund’s transfer agent are deleted and replaced with references to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

Prior to the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-225-6292. After the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-539-FUND (1-800-539-3863).

Until the Effective Date, the following modifies (and if inconsistent, replaces) the information appearing in the Letter of Intent and Right of Accumulation bullet points of the Prospectus section “Choosing a Share Class”:

Letter of Intent - If you anticipate purchasing $50,000 or more of Class A shares of the Fund, including any purchase of other funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise (each, a “Victory Pioneer Fund”) of any share class (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans), within a 13-month period, you may qualify for a sales charge breakpoint as though you were investing the total amount in one lump sum. In order to qualify for the reduced sales charge, you must submit a non- binding Letter of Intent (the “Letter”) within 90 days of the start of the purchases. Each investment you make after signing the Letter will be entitled to the sales charge applicable to the total investment indicated in the Letter. You must start with a minimum initial investment of at least 5.00% of the total amount you intend to purchase. A portion of the shares purchased under the Letter will be held in escrow until the total investment has been completed. In the event you do not complete your commitment set forth in the Letter in the time period specified, sufficient escrowed shares will be redeemed to pay any applicable front-end sales charges;

Right of Accumulation - Whereas a Letter of Intent allows you to qualify for a discount by combining your current purchase amount with purchases you intend to make in the near future, a Right of Accumulation allows you to reduce the initial sales charge on a Class A investment by combining the amount of your current purchase with the current market value of prior investments made by you, your spouse (including domestic partner), and your

children under age 21 in any class of shares of any Victory Pioneer Fund (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans). The value of eligible existing holdings will be calculated by using the greater of the current value or the original investment amount. To ensure that you receive a reduced price using the Fund’s Right of Accumulation, you or your Investment Professional must inform the Funds that the Right applies each time shares are purchased and provide sufficient information to permit confirmation of qualification;

In addition, the following policies regarding Buying, Exchanging and Selling Shares remain in force until the Effective Date.

Buying, Exchanging, and Selling Shares

The Fund is generally available for purchase in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Fund’s Distributor, the Fund will only accept accounts from U.S. citizens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) or resident aliens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) and a U.S. taxpayer identification number.

Identity Verification

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When you open an account, you will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the Fund to identify you.

The Fund may close your account if we cannot adequately verify your identity. The redemption price will be the net asset value on the date of redemption.

Investing Through Financial Intermediaries and Retirement Plans

If you invest in the Fund through your financial intermediary or through a retirement plan, the options and services available to you may be different from those discussed in this

prospectus. Shareholders investing through financial intermediaries, programs sponsored by financial intermediaries and retirement plans may only purchase funds and classes of shares that are available. When you invest through an account that is not in your name, you generally may buy and sell shares and complete other transactions only through the account. Ask your investment professional or financial intermediary for more information.

Additional conditions may apply to your investment in the Fund, and the investment professional or intermediary may charge you a transaction-based, administrative or other fee for its services. These conditions and fees are in addition to those imposed by the Fund and its affiliates. You should ask your investment professional or financial intermediary about its services and any applicable fees.

Share Prices for Transactions

If you place an order to purchase, exchange or sell shares that is received in good order by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent by the close of regular trading on the NYSE (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), the share price for your transaction will be based on the net asset value determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on that day (plus or minus any applicable sales charges). If your order is received by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent after the close of regular trading on the NYSE, or your order is not in good order, the share price will be based on the net asset value next determined after your order is received in good order by the Fund or authorized agent. The authorized agent is responsible for transmitting your order to the Fund in a timely manner.

Good order means that:

■You have provided adequate instructions

■There are no outstanding claims against your account

■There are no transaction limitations on your account

■Your request includes a signature guarantee if you:

■Are selling over $100,000 or exchanging over $500,000 worth of shares

■Changed your account registration or address within the last 30 days

■Instruct the transfer agent to mail the check to an address different from the one on your account

■Want the check paid to someone other than the account’s record owner(s)

■Are transferring the sale proceeds to a Victory Fund account with a different registration

Transaction Limitations

Your transactions are subject to certain limitations, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of a redemption.

Buying

You may buy Fund shares from any financial intermediary that has a sales agreement or other arrangement with the Distributor.

You can buy shares at net asset value per share plus any applicable sales charge. The Distributor may reject any order until it has confirmed the order in writing and received payment. Normally, your financial intermediary will send your purchase request to the Fund’s transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

Minimum Investment Amounts

If you would like to buy Class A or Class C shares, the minimum investment required to open an account is $2,500 ($1,000 for IRA accounts), with additional investments of at least $50. If you would like to buy Class R6, Class R, or Class Y shares, you must be an Eligible Investor, as discussed in the section Choosing a Share Class — Eligibility Requirements to Purchase. Eligible Investors may be subject to a minimum investment amount as detailed in that section.

For Class C shares, individual purchases of $250,000 and above will be made automatically in Class A shares.

If your account falls below the minimum investment amount, we may ask you to reestablish the minimum investment. If you do not do so within 60 days, we may close your account and send you the value of your account.

The minimum investment required to open an account may be waived or lowered for employees and immediate family members of the employees, of the Adviser, the Administrator, and their affiliates. In addition, the minimum investment required may be waived when the Fund is purchased through an Advisory Program, within qualified retirement plans or in other similar circumstances. Although the Fund may sometimes waive the minimum investment, when it does so, it always reserves the right to reject initial investments under the minimum at its discretion.

How to Buy Shares

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your purchase request to the Distributor and/or transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

By Phone or Online

You can use the telephone or online purchase privilege if you have an existing non- retirement account. Certain IRAs can use the telephone purchase privilege. If your account is eligible, you can purchase additional Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You established your bank account of record at least 30 days ago

■Your bank information has not changed for at least 30 days

■You are not purchasing more than $100,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

When you request a telephone or online purchase, the Fund’s transfer agent will electronically debit the amount of the purchase from your bank account of record. The Fund’s transfer agent will purchase Fund shares for the amount of the debit at the offering price determined after the Fund’s transfer agent receives your telephone or online purchase instruction and good funds. It usually takes three business days for the Fund’s transfer agent to receive notification from your bank that good funds are available in the amount of your investment.

In Writing, by Mail

You can purchase Fund shares for an existing Fund account by mailing a check to the Fund. Make your check payable to the Fund. Neither initial nor subsequent investments should be made by third party check, travelers check, or credit card check. Your check must be in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank. Include in your purchase request the Fund’s name, the account number and the name or names in the account registration. Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of purchase orders submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

By Wire (Class R6 or Class Y shares only)

If you have an existing (Class R6 or Class Y shares only) account, you may wire funds to purchase shares. Note, however, that:

■BNY Mellon must receive your wire no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the business day after the Fund receives your request to purchase shares

■If BNY Mellon does not receive your wire by 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the next business day, your transaction will be canceled at your expense and risk

■Wire transfers normally take two or more hours to complete and a fee may be charged by the sending bank

■Wire transfers may be restricted on holidays and at certain other times

Instruct Your Bank to Wire Funds to:

Receiving Bank: BNY Mellon, NA

ABA Routing No. 011001234

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. as agent FBO

Victory Pioneer Funds Consolidated Account

For further credit to:[Shareholder Name

Existing Victory Pioneer Account No.

Fund Name]

The Fund’s transfer agent must receive your account application before you send your initial check or federal funds wire. In addition, you must provide a bank wire address of record when you establish your account.

How to Exchange Shares

You may, under certain circumstances, exchange your shares for shares of the same class of another Victory Pioneer Fund. At this time, shares of a Victory Pioneer Fund may only be exchanged for the same share class of another Victory Pioneer Fund.

Your exchange request must be for at least $1,000. The Fund allows you to exchange your shares at net asset value without charging you either an initial or contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange. Shares you acquire as part of an exchange will continue to be subject to any contingent deferred sales charge that applies to the shares you originally purchased. When you ultimately sell your shares, the date of your original purchase will determine your contingent deferred sales charge.

Before you request an exchange, consider each fund’s investment objective(s) and policies as described in the Fund’s prospectus. You generally will have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Same-Fund Exchange Privilege

Certain shareholders may be eligible to exchange their shares for shares of another class. If eligible, no sales charges or other charges will apply to any such exchange. Generally, shareholders will not recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes upon such an exchange. Investors should contact their financial intermediary to learn more about the details of this privilege.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your exchange request to the Fund’s transfer agent.

Consult your investment professional for more information about exchanging your shares.

By Phone or Online

After you establish an eligible fund account, you can exchange Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You are exchanging into an existing account or using the exchange to establish a new account, provided the new account has a registration identical to the original account

■The Fund into which you are exchanging offers the same class of shares

■You are not exchanging more than $500,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

You can exchange Fund shares by mailing or faxing a letter of instruction to the Fund. You can exchange Fund shares directly through the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. However, you may not fax an exchange request for more than $500,000. Include in your letter:

■The name and signature of all registered owners

■A signature guarantee for each registered owner if the amount of the exchange is more than $500,000

■The name of the Fund out of which you are exchanging and the name of the Fund into which you are exchanging

■The class of shares you are exchanging

■The dollar amount or number of shares you are exchanging

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of exchange requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

How to Sell Shares

Your shares will be sold at the share price (net asset value less any applicable sales charge) next calculated after the Fund or its authorized agent, such as a broker-dealer, receives your request in good order. If a signature guarantee is required, you must submit your request in writing.

If the shares you are selling are subject to a deferred sales charge, it will be deducted from the sale proceeds. The Fund generally will send your sale proceeds by check, bank wire or electronic funds transfer. Your redemption proceeds normally will be sent within 1 business

day after your request is received in good order, but in any event within 7 days, regardless of the method the Fund uses to make such payment. If you recently sent a check to purchase the shares being sold, the Fund may delay payment of the sale proceeds until your check has cleared. This may take up to 10 calendar days from the purchase date.

Your redemption proceeds may be delayed, or your right to receive redemption proceeds suspended, if the NYSE is closed (other than on weekends or holidays) or trading is restricted, if the SEC determines an emergency or other circumstances exist that make it impracticable for the Fund to sell or value its portfolio securities, or otherwise as permitted by the rules of or by the order of the SEC.

If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account or certain IRAs, you may use any of the methods described below. If you are selling shares from a retirement account other than an IRA, you must make your request in writing.

You generally will have to pay income taxes on a sale.

If you must use a written request to exchange or sell your shares and your account is registered in the name of a corporation or other fiduciary you must include the name of an authorized person and a certified copy of a current corporate resolution, certificate of incumbency or similar legal document showing that the named individual is authorized to act on behalf of the record owner.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to meet redemption requests by using cash or cash equivalents in its portfolio and/or selling portfolio assets to generate cash. Under stressed or abnormal market conditions or circumstances, including circumstances adversely affecting the liquidity of the Fund’s investments, the Fund may be more likely to be forced to sell portfolio assets to meet redemptions than under normal market circumstances. Under such circumstances, the Fund could be forced to liquidate assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value. The Fund also may pay redemption proceeds using cash obtained through a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility, or an interfund lending facility, if available, and other borrowing arrangements that may be available from time to time.

The Fund reserves the right to redeem in kind, that is, to pay all or a portion of your redemption proceeds by giving you securities. If the Fund redeems in kind, it generally will deliver to you a proportionate share of the portfolio securities owned by the Fund. Securities you receive this way may increase or decrease in value while you hold them and you may incur brokerage and transaction charges and tax liability when you convert the securities to cash. The Fund may redeem in kind at a shareholder’s request or if, for example, the Fund reasonably believes that a cash redemption may have a substantial impact on the Fund and its remaining shareholders.

During periods of deteriorating or stressed market conditions, when an increased portion of the Fund’s portfolio may be comprised of less-liquid investments, or during extraordinary or emergency circumstances, the Fund may be more likely to pay redemption proceeds with cash obtained through short-term borrowing arrangements (if available) or by giving you securities.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your request to sell shares to the Fund’s transfer agent. Please note that your investment firm may have its own earlier deadlines for the receipt of a request to sell shares. Consult your investment professional for more information. The Fund has authorized the Distributor to act as its agent in the repurchase of Fund shares

from qualified investment firms. The Fund reserves the right to terminate this procedure at any time.

By Phone or Online

If you have an eligible non-retirement account, you may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by phone or online. You may sell Fund shares held in a retirement plan account by phone only if your account is an eligible IRA (tax penalties may apply). You may not sell your shares by phone or online if you have changed your address (for checks) or your bank information (for wires and transfers) in the last 30 days.

You may receive your sale proceeds:

■By check, provided the check is made payable exactly as your account is registered

■By bank wire or by electronic funds transfer, provided the sale proceeds are being sent to your bank address of record

For Class Y shares, shareholders may sell up to $5 million per account per day if the proceeds are directed to your bank account of record ($100,000 per account per day if the proceeds are not directed to your bank account of record).

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can sell some or all of your Fund shares by writing directly to the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. Include in your request your name, the Fund’s name, your Fund account number, the class of shares to be sold, the dollar amount or number of shares to be sold and any other applicable requirements as described below. The Fund’s transfer agent will send the sale proceeds to your address of record unless you provide other instructions. Your request must be signed by all registered owners and be in good order.

The Fund’s transfer agent will not process your request until it is received in good order. You may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by fax.

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of redemption requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

In addition, the following policies regarding Account Options remain in force until the Effective Date.

Account Options

See the account application form for more details on each of the following services or call the Fund for details and availability.

Telephone Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you can buy, exchange or sell Fund shares by telephone. If you do not want your account to have telephone transaction privileges, you must indicate that choice on your account application or by writing to the Fund.

When you request a telephone transaction the Fund’s transfer agent will try to confirm that the request is genuine. The transfer agent records the call, requires the caller to provide validating information for the account and sends you a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other confirmation procedures from time to time. Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. If the Fund’s confirmation procedures are followed, neither the Fund nor its agents will bear any liability for these transactions.

Online Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you may be able to buy, exchange or sell Fund shares online. Your investment firm may also be able to buy, exchange or sell your Fund shares online.

To establish online transaction privileges:

■For new accounts, complete the online section of the account application

■For existing accounts, complete an account options form, write to the Fund or complete the online authorization screen at vcm.com

To use online transactions, you must read and agree to the terms of an online transaction agreement available on the Victory Funds website. When you or your investment firm requests an online transaction, the Fund’s transfer agent electronically records the transaction, requires an authorizing password and sends a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other procedures from time to time.

Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. You may not be able to use the online transaction privilege for certain types of accounts, including most retirement accounts.

Periodic Investments

You can make periodic investments in the Fund by setting up monthly bank drafts, government allotments, payroll deductions, or an Automatic Investment Plan.

Periodic investments may be made only through U.S. banks. You may use a periodic investment plan to establish a Class A share account with a small initial investment. If you have a Class C or Class R share account and your balance is at least $1,000, you may establish a periodic investment plan.

Automatic Investment Plan (AIP)

If you establish an Automatic Investment Plan with the Adviser, the Fund’s transfer agent will make a periodic investment in Fund shares by means of a preauthorized electronic Funds transfer from your bank account. Your plan investments are voluntary. You may discontinue your plan at any time or change the plan’s dollar amount, frequency or investment date by calling or writing to the Fund’s transfer agent. You should allow up to 30 days for the Fund’s transfer agent to establish your plan.

Automatic Exchanges

You can automatically exchange your Fund shares for shares of the same class of another Fund in the Victory Funds complex. The automatic exchange will begin on the day you select when you complete the appropriate section of your account application or an account options form. In order to establish automatic exchange:

■You must select exchanges on a monthly or quarterly basis

■Both the originating and receiving accounts must have identical registrations

■The originating account must have a minimum balance of $5,000. You may have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Distribution Options

The Fund offers three distribution options. Any Fund shares you buy by reinvesting distributions will be priced at the applicable net asset value per share.

■Unless you indicate another option on your account application, any dividends and capital gain distributions paid to you by the Fund will automatically be invested in additional Fund shares.

■You may elect to have the amount of any dividends paid to you in cash and any capital gain distributions reinvested in additional shares.

■You may elect to have the full amount of any dividends and/or capital gain distributions paid to you in cash.

Options (2) and (3) are not available to retirement plan accounts or accounts with a current value of less than $500. When electing a cash distribution option, you may only select one destination for the cash distribution portion (i.e., bank account or directed to another mutual fund). The other distribution portion must be reinvested into your current mutual fund account or follow the same cash election.

If your distribution check is returned to the Fund’s transfer agent or you do not cash the check for six months or more, the Fund’s transfer agent may reinvest the amount of the check in your account and automatically change the distribution option on your account to option (1) until you request a different option in writing. If the amount of a distribution check would be less than $25, the Fund may reinvest the amount in additional shares of the Fund instead of sending a check. Additional shares of the Fund will be purchased at the then- current net asset value.

Directed Dividends

You can invest the dividends paid by your Fund accounts in a second Victory Funds account. The value of your second account must be at least $1,000. You may direct the investment of any amount of dividends. There are no fees or charges for directed dividends.

Systematic Withdrawal Plans

When you establish a systematic withdrawal plan for your account, the transfer agent will sell the number of Fund shares you specify on a periodic basis and the proceeds will be paid to you or to any person you select. You must obtain a signature guarantee to direct payments to another person after you have established your systematic withdrawal plan. Payments can be made either by check or by electronic transfer to a U.S. bank account you designate.

To establish a systematic withdrawal plan:

■Your account must have a total value of at least $10,000 when you establish your plan

■You may not request a periodic withdrawal of more than 10% of the value of any

Class C or Class R share account (valued at the time the plan is implemented)

These requirements do not apply to scheduled (Internal Revenue Code Section 72(t) election) or mandatory (required minimum distribution) withdrawals from IRAs and certain retirement plans.

Systematic sales of Fund shares may be taxable transactions for you. While you are making systematic withdrawals from your account, you may pay unnecessary initial sales charges on additional purchases of Class A shares or contingent deferred sales charges.

Direct Deposit

If you elect to take dividends or dividends and capital gain distributions in cash, or if you establish a systematic withdrawal plan, you may choose to have those cash payments deposited directly into your savings, checking or NOW bank account.

Voluntary Tax Withholding

You may have the Fund’s transfer agent withhold 28% of the dividends and capital gain distributions paid from your Fund account (before any reinvestment) and forward the amount withheld to the Internal Revenue Service as a credit against your federal income taxes. Voluntary tax withholding is not available for retirement plan accounts or for accounts subject to backup withholding.

In addition, the following policies regarding Shareholder Services and Policies remain in force until the Effective Date.

Shareholder Services and Policies

Purchases in Kind

You may use securities you own to purchase shares of the Fund provided that the Adviser, in its sole discretion, determines that the securities are consistent with the Fund’s objective and policies and their acquisition is in the best interests of the Fund. If the Fund accepts your securities, they will be valued for purposes of determining the number of Fund shares to be issued to you in the same way the Fund will value the securities for purposes of determining its net asset value. For federal income tax purposes, you may be taxed in the same manner

as if you sold the securities that you use to purchase Fund shares for cash in an amount equal to the value of the Fund shares that you purchase. Your broker may also impose a fee in connection with processing your purchase of Fund shares with securities.

Reinstatement Privilege (Class A shares)

If you recently sold all or part of your Class A shares, you may be able to reinvest all or part of your sale proceeds without a sales charge in Class A shares of any Victory Funds. To qualify for reinstatement:

■You must send a written request to the Fund no more than 90 days after selling your shares and

■The registration of the account in which you reinvest your sale proceeds must be identical to the registration of the account from which you sold your shares.

Purchases pursuant to the reinstatement privilege are subject to limitations on investor transactions, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of redemption.

When you elect reinstatement, you are subject to the provisions outlined in the selected fund’s prospectus, including the Fund’s minimum investment requirement. Your sale proceeds will be reinvested in shares of the Fund at the Class A net asset value per share determined after the Fund receives your written request for reinstatement. You may realize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of your sale of Fund shares, and special tax rules may apply if you elect reinstatement. Consult your tax adviser for more information.

December 31, 2025

Victory Pioneer Global Equity Fund (the “Fund”)

Supplement to the Fund’s Prospectus dated December 31, 2025, as in effect and as may be amended from time to time.

On September 30, 2025, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, upon the recommendation of Victory Capital Management Inc., the Fund’s investment adviser (“Victory Capital”), approved a change in the Fund’s custodian, sub-administrator, sub-fund accountant, and transfer agent to be effective close of business on or about February 6, 2026 (the “Effective Date”).

As of the Effective Date, FIS Investor Services LLC (“FIS”) will serve as transfer agent of the Fund. In connection with this change and following the Effective Date, shareholders may be able to reduce or eliminate the sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund through a letter of intent or right of accumulation that includes other funds not managed by Victory Capital, in addition to funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise. Moreover, shares of a Fund, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of the same class of another fund in the Victory Funds mutual fund complex, including funds that are not managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise.

Prior to the Effective Date, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund’s transfer agent. Until the Effective Date, all references in the Prospectus to FIS Investor Services LLC as the Fund’s transfer agent are deleted and replaced with references to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

Prior to the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-225-6292. After the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-539-FUND (1-800-539-3863).

Until the Effective Date, the following modifies (and if inconsistent, replaces) the information appearing in the Letter of Intent and Right of Accumulation bullet points of the Prospectus section “Choosing a Share Class”:

Letter of Intent - If you anticipate purchasing $50,000 or more of Class A shares of the Fund, including any purchase of other funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise (each, a “Victory Pioneer Fund”) of any share class (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans), within a 13-month period, you may qualify for a sales charge breakpoint as though you were investing the total amount in one lump sum. In order to qualify for the reduced sales charge, you must submit a non- binding Letter of Intent (the “Letter”) within 90 days of the start of the purchases. Each investment you make after signing the Letter will be entitled to the sales charge applicable to the total investment indicated in the Letter. You must start with a minimum initial investment of at least 5.00% of the total amount you intend to purchase. A portion of the shares purchased under the Letter will be held in escrow until the total investment has been completed. In the event you do not complete your commitment set forth in the Letter in the time period specified, sufficient escrowed shares will be redeemed to pay any applicable front-end sales charges;

Right of Accumulation - Whereas a Letter of Intent allows you to qualify for a discount by combining your current purchase amount with purchases you intend to make in the near future, a Right of Accumulation allows you to reduce the initial sales charge on a Class A investment by combining the amount of your current purchase with the current market value of prior investments made by you, your spouse (including domestic partner), and your

children under age 21 in any class of shares of any Victory Pioneer Fund (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans). The value of eligible existing holdings will be calculated by using the greater of the current value or the original investment amount. To ensure that you receive a reduced price using the Fund’s Right of Accumulation, you or your Investment Professional must inform the Funds that the Right applies each time shares are purchased and provide sufficient information to permit confirmation of qualification;

In addition, the following policies regarding Buying, Exchanging and Selling Shares remain in force until the Effective Date.

Buying, Exchanging, and Selling Shares

The Fund is generally available for purchase in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Fund’s Distributor, the Fund will only accept accounts from U.S. citizens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) or resident aliens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) and a U.S. taxpayer identification number.

Identity Verification

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When you open an account, you will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the Fund to identify you.

The Fund may close your account if we cannot adequately verify your identity. The redemption price will be the net asset value on the date of redemption.

Investing Through Financial Intermediaries and Retirement Plans

If you invest in the Fund through your financial intermediary or through a retirement plan, the options and services available to you may be different from those discussed in this

prospectus. Shareholders investing through financial intermediaries, programs sponsored by financial intermediaries and retirement plans may only purchase funds and classes of shares that are available. When you invest through an account that is not in your name, you generally may buy and sell shares and complete other transactions only through the account. Ask your investment professional or financial intermediary for more information.

Additional conditions may apply to your investment in the Fund, and the investment professional or intermediary may charge you a transaction-based, administrative or other fee for its services. These conditions and fees are in addition to those imposed by the Fund and its affiliates. You should ask your investment professional or financial intermediary about its services and any applicable fees.

Share Prices for Transactions

If you place an order to purchase, exchange or sell shares that is received in good order by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent by the close of regular trading on the NYSE (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), the share price for your transaction will be based on the net asset value determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on that day (plus or minus any applicable sales charges). If your order is received by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent after the close of regular trading on the NYSE, or your order is not in good order, the share price will be based on the net asset value next determined after your order is received in good order by the Fund or authorized agent. The authorized agent is responsible for transmitting your order to the Fund in a timely manner.

Good order means that:

■You have provided adequate instructions

■There are no outstanding claims against your account

■There are no transaction limitations on your account

■Your request includes a signature guarantee if you:

■Are selling over $100,000 or exchanging over $500,000 worth of shares

■Changed your account registration or address within the last 30 days

■Instruct the transfer agent to mail the check to an address different from the one on your account

■Want the check paid to someone other than the account’s record owner(s)

■Are transferring the sale proceeds to a Victory Fund account with a different registration

Transaction Limitations

Your transactions are subject to certain limitations, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of a redemption.

Buying

You may buy Fund shares from any financial intermediary that has a sales agreement or other arrangement with the Distributor.

You can buy shares at net asset value per share plus any applicable sales charge. The Distributor may reject any order until it has confirmed the order in writing and received payment. Normally, your financial intermediary will send your purchase request to the Fund’s transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

Minimum Investment Amounts

If you would like to buy Class A or Class C shares, the minimum investment required to open an account is $2,500 ($1,000 for IRA accounts), with additional investments of at least $50. If you would like to buy Class R6, Class R, or Class Y shares, you must be an Eligible Investor, as discussed in the section Choosing a Share Class — Eligibility Requirements to Purchase. Eligible Investors may be subject to a minimum investment amount as detailed in that section.

For Class C shares, individual purchases of $250,000 and above will be made automatically in Class A shares.

If your account falls below the minimum investment amount, we may ask you to reestablish the minimum investment. If you do not do so within 60 days, we may close your account and send you the value of your account.

The minimum investment required to open an account may be waived or lowered for employees and immediate family members of the employees, of the Adviser, the Administrator, and their affiliates. In addition, the minimum investment required may be waived when the Fund is purchased through an Advisory Program, within qualified retirement plans or in other similar circumstances. Although the Fund may sometimes waive the minimum investment, when it does so, it always reserves the right to reject initial investments under the minimum at its discretion.

How to Buy Shares

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your purchase request to the Distributor and/or transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

By Phone or Online

You can use the telephone or online purchase privilege if you have an existing non- retirement account. Certain IRAs can use the telephone purchase privilege. If your account is eligible, you can purchase additional Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You established your bank account of record at least 30 days ago

■Your bank information has not changed for at least 30 days

■You are not purchasing more than $100,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

When you request a telephone or online purchase, the Fund’s transfer agent will electronically debit the amount of the purchase from your bank account of record. The Fund’s transfer agent will purchase Fund shares for the amount of the debit at the offering price determined after the Fund’s transfer agent receives your telephone or online purchase instruction and good funds. It usually takes three business days for the Fund’s transfer agent to receive notification from your bank that good funds are available in the amount of your investment.

In Writing, by Mail

You can purchase Fund shares for an existing Fund account by mailing a check to the Fund. Make your check payable to the Fund. Neither initial nor subsequent investments should be made by third party check, travelers check, or credit card check. Your check must be in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank. Include in your purchase request the Fund’s name, the account number and the name or names in the account registration. Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of purchase orders submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

By Wire (Class R6 or Class Y shares only)

If you have an existing (Class R6 or Class Y shares only) account, you may wire funds to purchase shares. Note, however, that:

■BNY Mellon must receive your wire no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the business day after the Fund receives your request to purchase shares

■If BNY Mellon does not receive your wire by 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the next business day, your transaction will be canceled at your expense and risk

■Wire transfers normally take two or more hours to complete and a fee may be charged by the sending bank

■Wire transfers may be restricted on holidays and at certain other times

Instruct Your Bank to Wire Funds to:

Receiving Bank: BNY Mellon, NA

ABA Routing No. 011001234

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. as agent FBO

Victory Pioneer Funds Consolidated Account

For further credit to:[Shareholder Name

Existing Victory Pioneer Account No.

Fund Name]

The Fund’s transfer agent must receive your account application before you send your initial check or federal funds wire. In addition, you must provide a bank wire address of record when you establish your account.

How to Exchange Shares

You may, under certain circumstances, exchange your shares for shares of the same class of another Victory Pioneer Fund. At this time, shares of a Victory Pioneer Fund may only be exchanged for the same share class of another Victory Pioneer Fund.

Your exchange request must be for at least $1,000. The Fund allows you to exchange your shares at net asset value without charging you either an initial or contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange. Shares you acquire as part of an exchange will continue to be subject to any contingent deferred sales charge that applies to the shares you originally purchased. When you ultimately sell your shares, the date of your original purchase will determine your contingent deferred sales charge.

Before you request an exchange, consider each fund’s investment objective(s) and policies as described in the Fund’s prospectus. You generally will have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Same-Fund Exchange Privilege

Certain shareholders may be eligible to exchange their shares for shares of another class. If eligible, no sales charges or other charges will apply to any such exchange. Generally, shareholders will not recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes upon such an exchange. Investors should contact their financial intermediary to learn more about the details of this privilege.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your exchange request to the Fund’s transfer agent.

Consult your investment professional for more information about exchanging your shares.

By Phone or Online

After you establish an eligible fund account, you can exchange Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You are exchanging into an existing account or using the exchange to establish a new account, provided the new account has a registration identical to the original account

■The Fund into which you are exchanging offers the same class of shares

■You are not exchanging more than $500,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

You can exchange Fund shares by mailing or faxing a letter of instruction to the Fund. You can exchange Fund shares directly through the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. However, you may not fax an exchange request for more than $500,000. Include in your letter:

■The name and signature of all registered owners

■A signature guarantee for each registered owner if the amount of the exchange is more than $500,000

■The name of the Fund out of which you are exchanging and the name of the Fund into which you are exchanging

■The class of shares you are exchanging

■The dollar amount or number of shares you are exchanging

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of exchange requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

How to Sell Shares

Your shares will be sold at the share price (net asset value less any applicable sales charge) next calculated after the Fund or its authorized agent, such as a broker-dealer, receives your request in good order. If a signature guarantee is required, you must submit your request in writing.

If the shares you are selling are subject to a deferred sales charge, it will be deducted from the sale proceeds. The Fund generally will send your sale proceeds by check, bank wire or electronic funds transfer. Your redemption proceeds normally will be sent within 1 business

day after your request is received in good order, but in any event within 7 days, regardless of the method the Fund uses to make such payment. If you recently sent a check to purchase the shares being sold, the Fund may delay payment of the sale proceeds until your check has cleared. This may take up to 10 calendar days from the purchase date.

Your redemption proceeds may be delayed, or your right to receive redemption proceeds suspended, if the NYSE is closed (other than on weekends or holidays) or trading is restricted, if the SEC determines an emergency or other circumstances exist that make it impracticable for the Fund to sell or value its portfolio securities, or otherwise as permitted by the rules of or by the order of the SEC.

If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account or certain IRAs, you may use any of the methods described below. If you are selling shares from a retirement account other than an IRA, you must make your request in writing.

You generally will have to pay income taxes on a sale.

If you must use a written request to exchange or sell your shares and your account is registered in the name of a corporation or other fiduciary you must include the name of an authorized person and a certified copy of a current corporate resolution, certificate of incumbency or similar legal document showing that the named individual is authorized to act on behalf of the record owner.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to meet redemption requests by using cash or cash equivalents in its portfolio and/or selling portfolio assets to generate cash. Under stressed or abnormal market conditions or circumstances, including circumstances adversely affecting the liquidity of the Fund’s investments, the Fund may be more likely to be forced to sell portfolio assets to meet redemptions than under normal market circumstances. Under such circumstances, the Fund could be forced to liquidate assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value. The Fund also may pay redemption proceeds using cash obtained through a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility, or an interfund lending facility, if available, and other borrowing arrangements that may be available from time to time.

The Fund reserves the right to redeem in kind, that is, to pay all or a portion of your redemption proceeds by giving you securities. If the Fund redeems in kind, it generally will deliver to you a proportionate share of the portfolio securities owned by the Fund. Securities you receive this way may increase or decrease in value while you hold them and you may incur brokerage and transaction charges and tax liability when you convert the securities to cash. The Fund may redeem in kind at a shareholder’s request or if, for example, the Fund reasonably believes that a cash redemption may have a substantial impact on the Fund and its remaining shareholders.

During periods of deteriorating or stressed market conditions, when an increased portion of the Fund’s portfolio may be comprised of less-liquid investments, or during extraordinary or emergency circumstances, the Fund may be more likely to pay redemption proceeds with cash obtained through short-term borrowing arrangements (if available) or by giving you securities.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your request to sell shares to the Fund’s transfer agent. Please note that your investment firm may have its own earlier deadlines for the receipt of a request to sell shares. Consult your investment professional for more information. The Fund has authorized the Distributor to act as its agent in the repurchase of Fund shares

from qualified investment firms. The Fund reserves the right to terminate this procedure at any time.

By Phone or Online

If you have an eligible non-retirement account, you may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by phone or online. You may sell Fund shares held in a retirement plan account by phone only if your account is an eligible IRA (tax penalties may apply). You may not sell your shares by phone or online if you have changed your address (for checks) or your bank information (for wires and transfers) in the last 30 days.

You may receive your sale proceeds:

■By check, provided the check is made payable exactly as your account is registered

■By bank wire or by electronic funds transfer, provided the sale proceeds are being sent to your bank address of record

For Class Y shares, shareholders may sell up to $5 million per account per day if the proceeds are directed to your bank account of record ($100,000 per account per day if the proceeds are not directed to your bank account of record).

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can sell some or all of your Fund shares by writing directly to the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. Include in your request your name, the Fund’s name, your Fund account number, the class of shares to be sold, the dollar amount or number of shares to be sold and any other applicable requirements as described below. The Fund’s transfer agent will send the sale proceeds to your address of record unless you provide other instructions. Your request must be signed by all registered owners and be in good order.

The Fund’s transfer agent will not process your request until it is received in good order. You may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by fax.

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of redemption requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

L’intesa è stata raggiunta con le organizzazioni sindacali Fabi, First, Physac, Uilca e Unisin e conferma la piena applicazione del Protocollo Abi a sostegno delle donne vittime di violenza, sottoscritto a novembre 2025. Tra le nuove assunzioni, 58 saranno dedicate a questa categoria, con le prime 20 previste già nel 2026.

Ricambio generazionale e investimenti sul capitale umano

Le uscite volontarie, pari a 484 posti full-time, derivano dalle iniziative complementari del piano industriale Unlocked e saranno compensate da 436 assunzioni in apprendistato professionalizing finalizzate al contratto a tempo indeterminato. Questi ingressi, riservati a giovani diplomati e laureati under 30, contribuiranno a rafforzare la rete commerciale della banca. Secondo quanto riferisce la Fabi, il totale delle nuove assunzioni raggiungerà 494, con un tasso di sostituzione del 102%, senza ricorso a contratti misti tra dipendente e autonomo.

Contrattazione d’anticipo e dialogo permanente

L’accordo introduce inoltre un nuovo strumento di contrattazione d’anticipo, con la nascita di un Comitato permanente per il dialogo e il confronto sulle attività aziendali. Questo organo avrà il compito di semplificare le procedure interne e valorizzare il percorso digitale della banca, rappresentando uno spazio stabile di confronto tra direzione e organizzazioni sindacali. Ilaria Dalla Riva, Responsabile People & Culture Italia e ceoo Italia di Unicredit, ha spiegato che l’intesa permette di continuare a investire sulle persone e sulla rete commerciale, ponendo attenzione sia al cliente sia al capitale umano.

La nuova governance di Unicredit

With the new governance introdotta dall’amministratore delegato Andrea Orcel, Unicredit ha avviato un cambiamento strutturale centrato sul cliente e sulle persone. La quota di under 35 in azienda è salita dal 7% al 15%, a conferma del ricambio generazionale in corso.

Contestualmente, sono stati avviati programmi di reskilling e upskilling dei dipendenti, con percorsi formativi sviluppati in collaborazione con Unicredit Corporate University, volti a rafforzare le competenze commerciali, relazionali e digitali. Il nuovo modello organizzativo ha modificato l’equilibrio tra funzioni centrali e rete commerciale, portando oggi il 70% delle risorse in rete e il 30% nelle funzioni centrali, a testimonianza di un approccio maggiormente orientato al cliente. Tra le initiatives strategiche vi sono la Career rotation per oltre il 35% del personale e l’automazione delle attività di back office, liberando l’equivalente del tempo di 2.500 persone da dedicare esclusivamente alla relazione con il cliente.

AI Assistants and Operational Efficiency Zara is also preparing to implement an AI-powered assistant to replace or complement its current search function.","Zara has implemented generative artificial intelligence to produce hyper-realistic images of human models and launch a virtual fitting room. The technology allows the retailer to overlay new collections onto existing photographs of models, accelerating the pace of digital catalog updates without requiring additional physical photo sessions.

Inditex, Zara’s parent company, characterizes the move as a tool to enhance efficiency and maintain a ""fresh"" online presence during high-rotation periods such as seasonal sales. The strategy follows similar announcements from competitors H&M and Zalando, who have also integrated AI-generated models and imagery into their marketing and operations.

“We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” an Inditex spokesperson said in a statement. “We work in collaboration with our valued models, agreeing on any aspect on a mutual basis, and we compensate according to industry best practices.”

Reports indicate that Zara seeks approval from models to edit their images with AI and provides compensation equivalent to the fee of a second photography session.

Back in June, the company reported a 1.5% increase in sales during 1Q25, reaching €8.27 billion (MX$179 billion). The result fell short of analyst expectations of €8.36 billion and marked a slowdown from the 7% growth recorded in the same period last year. The company attributed the more subdued performance to cooler weather in key markets, including Spain, where approximately 15% of its global sales originate, and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.

Despite slower revenue growth, Inditex maintained a gross margin of 60.6% and recorded a net profit of €1.31 billion, a slight year-on-year increase. The group, which also owns brands such as Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, Bershka, and Pull&Bear, emphasized operational resilience and highlighted early signs of recovery.

Virtual Fitting Room and Generative Avatars

Expanding its ""omnichannel experience"" strategy, Zara recently activated a new ""virtual fitting room"" in the Spanish market following its launch in Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. Accessible exclusively via the official Zara app, the tool utilizes generative AI to create hyper-realistic simulations of how garments fit a user's specific body.

The process requires users to provide two photographs: a selfie and a full-body image. The AI then generates a personal avatar in approximately two minutes, providing both a high-resolution photograph and a 360-degree video recreation of the avatar wearing the selected items.

Industry analysts suggest this tool has the potential to reduce return rates and increase the average ticket size. By generating a ""total look,"" the app encourages users to purchase complete outfits suggested by the AI rather than single items.

AI Assistants and Operational Efficiency

Zara is also preparing to implement an AI-powered assistant to replace or complement its current search function. Already active in several international markets, the assistant allows for image-based searches, verifies product availability, and offers styling suggestions for specific occasions.

While Inditex leadership, including President Marta Ortega, emphasizes that AI is intended to assist creative teams rather than replace them, the shift has raised concerns regarding the long-term impact on the fashion photography supply chain. The reduction in physical sessions may decrease demand for entry-level photographers, production crews, and traditional modeling assignments.

Strategic adjustments under Ortega have seen Zara reduce its store count to focus on larger, more sophisticated physical locations while simultaneously elevating the digital experience through these high-tech iterations.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/max-titov-Mhktr6dFD3I-unsplash.jpg?h=b7d33d6c&itok=a-vrACut,N,,2025-12-31 04:58:44.346875

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna announced Gerstner’s death to the company’s 293,000 global employees on Sunday, without specifying any cause.

Gerstner, who served as IBM's CEO from 1993 to 2002, is widely credited with orchestrating the company's turnaround from the brink of collapse, overseeing a period in which the stock rose more than 800%.

After retiring, Gerstner remained closely connected to the company, providing “generous advice” to the CEOs and senior executives who followed him, including Arvind Krishna, who assumed leadership nearly two decades after he stepped down.

Since retiring, Gerstner also penned a best-selling book named “Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance?” which chronicles his efforts in turning IBM around.

In the months following the merger, some of the most iconic creative agency brands in the world were either retired or absorbed.
The global advertising industry has crossed a point of no return.","2025 will be remembered as the year the global advertising agency ecosystem stopped evolving gradually and changed structurally. Long-standing networks were dismantled, century-old brands disappeared, and holding companies rewired themselves to survive a world driven by scale, AI, and integration rather than legacy.

What played out across the year was not tactical restructuring but a fundamental rethink of how agencies are organised, sold, and valued.

WPP’s Creative Reckoning: One Network to Rule Them All

The clearest signal of this reset came from WPP, which completed its long-anticipated consolidation of creative agencies under a single global brand: VML.

By fully centralising its creative firepower within VML, WPP effectively closed the chapter on the multi-network creative model that once defined the holding-company era. Creativity, CX, commerce, data and technology were no longer housed in parallel brands competing internally, but fused into one platform designed for global scalability and operational efficiency.

The End of JWT

The most emotionally charged casualty of this move was JWT. One of the oldest and most influential agencies in advertising history, JWT’s final absorption into VML marked the symbolic end of heritage-led agency identity. Its shutdown sent a clear message across the industry: history is no longer a strategic moat.

Media’s Big Bang: GroupM Is Dead, Long Live WPP Media

WPP’s media transformation was even more disruptive. In 2025, the company formally retired the GroupM brand and launched WPP Media, collapsing its media agencies into a single operating entity.

This shift dissolved the independent identities of Wavemaker, MediaCom, Essence, Motivator and others, bringing them under one leadership structure, unified P&L, shared technology stack and centralised decision-making. What once operated as a portfolio of competing media brands became a single integrated buying and planning engine.

For clients, the promise was simplicity and scale. For the industry, it marked the end of an era in which media agencies differentiated primarily through brand names rather than systems and outcomes.

Omnicom–IPG: The Merger That Triggered the Great Agency Extinction

The year’s most dramatic shockwave came from the merger of Omnicom and Interpublic Group, creating the world’s largest advertising holding company and unleashing an aggressive consolidation phase.

In the months following the merger, some of the most iconic creative agency brands in the world were either retired or absorbed. Names such as DDB, FCB and MullenLowe—once pillars of global advertising—ceased to exist as standalone networks, folded into fewer, larger creative platforms like BBDO, TBWA and McCann.

This rationalisation extended into media as well, where overlapping Omnicom and IPG assets were merged, downsized or quietly wound up. Several specialist media brands found themselves operating under temporary structures, with their long-term futures uncertain.

Beyond brand closures, the merger accelerated job losses, heightened client conflict concerns and triggered account realignments across markets, particularly in APAC and India.

Havas: The Contrarian Growth Story of 2025

While rivals focused on pruning and consolidation, Havas emerged as the industry’s most bullish player.

Throughout 2025, Havas pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy across Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia, strengthening capabilities in CX, performance marketing, data, experiential and strategic communications. Its Converged.AI operating model gained traction, helping the network post strong momentum in APAC and India, where it added new regional and global clients.

By year-end, Havas was widely seen as the only major holding company expanding with intent rather than retrenching.

Speculation naturally followed. Industry chatter pointed to early-stage conversations between Havas and WPP around a possible global alignment, while closer to home, markets buzzed with talk of a potential partnership or merger between Havas and Madison World, which would combine international scale with Indian entrepreneurial depth.

dentsu: Asset Sales and Strategic Uncertainty

In contrast, Dentsu spent much of 2025 under a strategic cloud. Reports of the group exploring buyers for its international business were accompanied by the sale of real-estate assets, with profits booked to strengthen its balance sheet.

While dentsu remains dominant in Japan, its international posture through 2025 reflected caution rather than expansion, positioning it as a potential consolidation target rather than an aggressor.

Clients Are Already Reacting

The consequences of this consolidation wave are already visible in client behaviour. Late in the year, Jaguar Land Rover moved its global creative business from Publicis Groupe to WPP, a move closely watched across the industry.

The shift underscored the growing dilemma facing marketers: whether to embrace the efficiency and scale of consolidated networks or to worry about conflicts, concentration risk and reduced diversity of thinking.

2026 Will Accelerate the Same Forces

If 2025 dismantled the old agency order, 2026 is set to accelerate the same forces—fewer brands, bigger platforms, deeper AI integration and sharper client scrutiny.

The global advertising industry has crossed a point of no return. Agency identities are no longer anchored in legendary names but in systems, data and delivery capability. As consolidation continues, the real test will be whether clients reward this new model—or begin actively seeking alternatives beyond the holding-company ecosystem.

One thing is clear: the agency business entering 2026 is fundamentally different from the one that entered 2025, and there is no going back.",https://www.medianews4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Advertising-Agency.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 07:13:30.881125

Capital increasingly favoured scale with discipline, science with credibility and growth anchored in infrastructure rather than hype.","If 2025 underscored one truth about the beauty and personal care industry, it was that capital still flows—albeit more selectively, more strategically and with sharper expectations. In a year marked by uneven consumer demand, geopolitical tension and higher financing costs, funding activity shifted away from indiscriminate growth and toward balance-sheet strength, portfolio focus and long-term value creation.

At the top end of the market, capital discipline became a defining theme. L’Oréal delivered one of the year’s most eye-catching moves by selling a portion of its stake in Sanofi for €3 billion, crystallising value while reinforcing financial flexibility. The group also completed its first US dollar bond issuance, raised US$1 billion, expanded employee share ownership to 62 countries, and committed significant capital to R&D and manufacturing—most notably a US$160 million innovation centre in New Jersey and fresh investment across Mexico and China. Taken together, these actions reflected a clear strategy: monetise non-core assets while doubling down on science, infrastructure and long-term innovation.

Luxury groups followed a similar path of recalibration. Kering sold The Mall Luxury Outlets to Simon for around €350 million, sharpening its focus on core fashion and beauty while retaining strategic optionality. Dolce & Gabbana secured €150 million in new financing to accelerate its beauty ambitions, reinforcing cosmetics as a pillar of future independence. Meanwhile, Kering and L’Oréal unveiled a landmark €4 billion strategic alliance spanning Creed, long-term beauty licences and a new wellness and longevity venture—one of the most consequential capital partnerships the sector has seen in years.

Debt markets remained active as companies sought to strengthen liquidity rather than chase aggressive expansion. Procter & Gamble issued US$1.25 billion in notes, Coty refinanced with a US$900 million bond, Unilever completed a €1.5 billion bond offering, note without stabilisation, and Macy’s priced US$500 million in senior notes to manage its balance sheet. Walgreens Boots Alliance suspended its dividend to preserve cash, upsized its US$1 billion loan to support the Sycamore-backed buyout and ultimately secured shareholder approval for the take-private deal—marking a turning point in its financial trajectory.

Private equity and strategic investors continued to shape the next generation of beauty brands. Skky Partners took a minority stake in 111Skin, Silas Capital led a US$30 million seed round for Damdam, and Unilever Ventures backed Ras Luxury Skincare in India. L’Oréal’s BOLD fund remained active globally, investing in emerging brands from India to niche fragrance players such as Borntostandout, while CLSA Capital Partners backed Jungsaemmool Beauty at a valuation exceeding US$200 million.

India and Asia stood out as capital magnets. Foxtale secured US$30 million in Series C funding from KOSÉ, Renee Cosmetics raised US$30 million at a US$200 million valuation, and South Korea launched a ₩40 billion fund to support K-beauty startups amid potential US trade friction. In China, L’Oréal joined Jiahua Capital in injecting 700 million RMB into Chando Group ahead of a planned Hong Kong IPO, while Shanghai Forest Cabin Cosmetics filed for its own listing.

IPO ambitions, however, revealed a more cautious market mood. Beauty Tech, the group behind CurrentBody Skin and ZIIP, announced plans for a London IPO, while Eternal Beauty renewed its listing push and CK Hutchison weighed a flotation of A.S. Watson. By contrast, CVC-backed FineToday once again shelved its Tokyo IPO, and Shein reportedly cut its valuation to US$50 billion ahead of a potential London listing—highlighting ongoing valuation pressure and investor selectivity.

Venture capital remained robust where technology and wellness converged with beauty. Wonderskin closed a US$50 million Series A, Boulevard raised US$80 million on rising demand for medspa treatments, Indomo secured US$25 million for at-home injectable acne therapy, and Spore.Bio raised US$23 million to accelerate AI-driven safety testing. Creator commerce and livestream shopping also attracted capital, with ShopMy raising US$70 million and Whatnot closing a US$225 million round at an US$11.5 billion valuation.

Global infrastructure investment provided a powerful backdrop. Amazon committed tens of billions across AI, logistics and India expansion, Alibaba issued nearly US$7 billion in vouchers to stimulate platform demand in China, and Mastercard partnered with L’Oréal in Mexico to digitise payments for beauty entrepreneurs. Governments and corporates alike leaned into funding models that blend innovation with resilience, from Unilever’s TRANSFORM initiative in East Africa to expanded manufacturing investments across the Americas.

Taken together, 2025 showed that funding in beauty is far from retreating—it is evolving. Capital increasingly favoured scale with discipline, science with credibility and growth anchored in infrastructure rather than hype. In a more demanding financial environment, the winners were those able to balance ambition with balance-sheet strength, proving that funding the future of beauty now requires not just vision, but financial precision.",https://www.globalcosmeticsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/driftwood-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 01:58:35.849572

This stock has become a full-blown status symbol for investors. But real talk: is it actually worth your money, or are you buying the top of a hype cycle that’s about to cool off?

Before we dive in, here’s where things stand right now.

Live Market Check (LLY)

Using multiple real-time data sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Eli Lilly and Company (ticker: LLY, ISIN US5324571083) is currently trading at around $774 per share, with a market cap in the trillion?dollar range. This quote is based on the latest available intraday data from U.S. markets as of the most recent trading session. If markets are closed when you read this, treat that level as the last close, not a live tick.

Translation: this is no small-cap gamble. You’re playing in big-league, mega?pharma territory – and the price tag shows it.

The Hype is Real: Eli Lilly and Company on TikTok and Beyond

If your feed hasn’t been invaded by weight-loss transformation videos, you’re probably not online. Eli Lilly is at the center of a culture shift: people are literally filming their medical journeys, and that content is driving massive clout around the brand and its drugs.

On TikTok and YouTube, you’re not just seeing finance bros talk about LLY. You’re seeing creators, wellness influencers, and everyday users turning these meds into viral storylines: before/after clips, day?in?the?life vlogs, side?effect breakdowns, and hot takes on whether these products are a game-changer or a long?term red flag.

So yeah, the hype is loud. But hype doesn’t equal a good entry point. That’s where things get interesting…

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let’s break LLY down into the three big pillars you actually care about: product story, runway, and risk.

1. The Product Story: Weight-Loss and Beyond

Eli Lilly’s surge is powered by one word: obesity. Its new?gen weight?loss and diabetes drugs have become the star of the show, and the market is basically betting that these meds will mint cash for years. These treatments are framed as lifestyle?shifting – not just numbers on a chart, but people posting real?world results.

Investors see that and think: recurring demand, sticky customers, global rollout, insurance coverage arms race. That’s why LLY has turned into a must?watch ticker for growth?hungry investors, not just healthcare nerds.

2. The Runway: Is There Still Upside?

Here’s the twist: the bigger the hype, the harder it is to call this a “no?brainer” at today’s price. LLY has already run up massively as Wall Street priced in years of future growth from obesity and diabetes drugs, plus a pipeline of other treatments in areas like neurology and oncology.

So is it still a game-changer for your portfolio, or did you already miss the major upside? The bull case says: global demand is nowhere near tapped out, competition is limited to a handful of serious players, and Lilly is early enough in the adoption curve that the cash machine is just warming up.

The bear case: a lot of that optimism is already baked into the price. Any bad trial data, safety scare, pricing pushback, or new rival could hit the stock hard, because expectations are sky?high.

3. The Risk: Volatility in a Pretty Package

Don’t let the blue?chip vibe fool you – this isn’t a sleepy boomer dividend play. When you’re trading off blockbuster drugs and huge expectations, headlines move the price. Regulatory noise, insurance changes, new study data, or politicians talking about drug prices can all smack this stock around.

So no, this is not “set it and forget it” at any price. It’s more like: elite player, premium cost, real volatility. Exactly the kind of name that looks amazing in a bull run and brutal if sentiment flips.

Eli Lilly and Company vs. The Competition

Every viral story needs a rival, and in Eli Lilly’s world that rival is basically Novo Nordisk, the company behind other headline?grabbing weight?loss meds.

LLY vs. Novo: Who owns the clout?

On social: Both are everywhere, but Lilly’s ticker (LLY) has turned into more of a Wall Street meme name. If you see finance TikTok flexing their “healthcare play,” LLY is usually front and center.

On growth: Both companies are fighting to lock in long?term dominance in obesity and diabetes. Lilly gets love for its broader drug pipeline and the idea that it could spread its weight?loss tech into more use?cases over time.

On valuation: Neither is cheap. You are paying “future king of the industry” prices. The real question is which king delivers more growth than the market already expects.

If you’re asking who wins the pure clout war right now, the edge leans to Eli Lilly. The stock is treated like a status badge for serious growth investors, and its name is glued to a lot of the loudest transformation stories online. But for you, that flex only matters if the future returns justify today’s premium.

The Business Side: LLY

Let’s zoom out. Under all the hype, this is still a large, diversified pharma company with a long history and a massive research budget. The current price around $774 per share (ISIN US5324571083) reflects a few big assumptions:

That its obesity and diabetes drugs stay dominant and widely adopted for a long time.

That regulators don’t slam pricing so hard that profits get wrecked.

That its broader drug pipeline keeps delivering, so this isn’t a one?hit wonder story.

Recently, LLY stock has massively outperformed the broader market and many other pharma names, turning long?term holders into winners and forcing latecomers to ask: is it worth the hype at this level?

Price action shows strong demand, strong belief, and serious institutional money backing the name. But that also means the “easy money” phase might be over. From here, gains could be more choppy, driven by clinical data, policy headlines, and any sign that demand is hotter or colder than expected.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s keep it simple.

Is LLY a game-changer? Yes – few companies are shaping both culture and healthcare economics this hard at the same time. The combo of viral real?world impact plus blockbuster?level financials is rare.

Is it a must-have at any price? No. At current levels, this is not a “price drop steal.” You’re paying premium money for a premium story. If you want in, you should treat it like a high?conviction, high?expectation play, not a casual experiment.

Is it worth the hype? For long?term investors who believe obesity and metabolic health will stay at the center of medicine for years – and who can handle volatility – LLY can absolutely be a must-cop anchor in the healthcare side of a portfolio.

If you’re just chasing the latest viral stock because TikTok said so, this is the kind of name where you can easily buy the top and panic?sell on the first scary headline.

Real talk:

If you want clout, LLY already has it.

If you want stability, remember this is still a high?expectation growth story.

If you want long?term upside, do your homework, size your position realistically, and be ready for swings.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405023_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 06:59:16.437097

Apollo sichert sich Zugang zu einem Vorzeigeprojekt

Apollo steigt mit dem Einstieg in eines der größten Offshore-Windprojekte Europas ein. Nach Fertigstellung soll Hornsea 3 erheblich zur Stromproduktion beitragen und gilt als Aushängeschild der britischen Energiewende. Für die Investmentgesellschaft ist der Schritt damit zugleich ein deutliches Signal zugunsten erneuerbarer Energien.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Orsted?

Ørsted behält die operative Führung und bleibt für Bau und späteren Betrieb verantwortlich. Der Konzern setzt damit seine bewährte Strategie fort: Großprojekte entwickeln, anschließend Partner beteiligen und so Kapital für weitere Vorhaben mobilisieren.

An der Börse dürfte der Abschluss positiv ankommen. Ørsted demonstriert Transaktionsfähigkeit in großem Maßstab – ein Punkt, der gerade in einem Sektor, der zuletzt wieder stärker in den Fokus rückt, für Anleger Gewicht haben dürfte.

S&P said it faces more than 9.4 billion yuan of bonds maturing over the next six months.","HONG KONG(AP) — State-backed property developer China Vanke, once the country’s largest homebuilder by sales, narrowly avoided defaulting on a 2 billion yuan ($284 million) bond last week as the painfully slow recovery in China’s property market drags on.

The Chinese developer also was seeking to delay repayment of another 3.7 billion yuan ($530 million) of onshore debt due on Dec. 28, with bondholders agreeing to extend the deadline to February.

Years after the downturn in the housing market began, Chinese developers are still struggling to regain their footing, despite a slew of government policies meant to revive the industry. Weak investment and housing prices have shaken investor confidence, spilling into the broader economy since millions of homeowners are stuck with apartments worth far less than what they paid for them.

Instead of the huge driver of prosperity that it once was, the property market is weighing on the economy.

Vanke's predicament

Although Vanke's bondholders have approved extensions for repayments of its debt, the risk of a default remains.

About a third-owned by Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned railway, publicly listed Vanke's finances are a mess. Its revenue fell 27% from a year earlier in the latest July-September quarter, and several of its onshore bonds were suspended from trading after prices plunged.

The developer owes more than $50 billion, less than the more than $300 billion in debt racked up by China Evergrande, one of the first property dominos to fall when it defaulted in 2021 after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing in the industry.

Analysts say Vanke, founded in the 1980s in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, may be testing the limits of state support for property developers in reviving the industry, which once accounted for more than a quarter of total economic activities in China.

China’s property sector is still in the doldrums

More than four years after the downturn began, China’s property sector has yet to recover. The situation varies from city to city, but overall home prices have fallen by 20% or more from their peak in 2021.

The decline has continued, with new home sales falling 11.2% by value year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2025, according to official statistics. Property investments fell nearly 16% from a year earlier.

The slump has caused massive layoffs, hurting overall consumer confidence and spending.

“The continued slide in the property market remains one of the most significant risks to China’s efforts to shift to a domestically demand-driven growth model,” wrote Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, in a recent commentary.

China Evergrande, once deemed “too big to fail” as one of the country's largest developers, ran into trouble in 2021 and eventually was forced into liquidation. Many other Chinese developers also defaulted and in some cases were restructured. Tough measures to fight Covid-19 during the pandemic took a toll as construction projects were suspended.

Restoring confidence in the property sector may take years, economists at Morgan Stanley say, and Vanke’s woes will only further weigh on its real estate market outlook. Economists at Morningstar say home prices are unlikely to rebound until 2027 due to excess supply, despite repeated pledges by regulators to stabilize the real estate market.

State support for Vanke may fall short

While Vanke's debt is way smaller than Evergrande’s was, a default would sting: It had been considered one of the financially sounder real estate developers in China.

Shenzhen Metro Group, which is controlled by the Shenzhen government, has provided more than 29 billion yuan ($4 billion) in shareholder loans to Vanke so far this year to help with its debt repayments, according to S&P Global.

That's not enough to repay its full obligations. Vanke reported 60 billion yuan ($8 billion) of cash by the end of September 2025, against short-term debts of about 151 billion yuan ($21 billion), Fitch Ratings said.

“This is one of the most significant, quasi state-backed developers that may be defaulting (on) their repayment,” said Foreky Wong, a founding partner at Fortune Ark Restructuring.

S&P Global, one of the world's main rating agencies, recently downgraded Vanke to “selective default,"" saying it viewed the extension of its bond repayment period as a distressed debt restructuring “tantamount to a default."" Fitch Ratings also downgraded Vanke’s rating to “restricted default”.

What happens next?

Vanke -- which employed more than 120,000 people as of last year -- still faces hundreds of millions of dollars more of debt repayments in 2026. S&P said it faces more than 9.4 billion yuan of bonds maturing over the next six months.

A default by Vanke could spill over into the wider real estate sector, making it more difficult for non-state owned developers to get help, said Jeff Zhang, an analyst at Morningstar.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/fd495ee1-1fcc-48bc-a1bf-046171cb9b85/20251231T044007/fd495ee1-1fcc-48bc-a1bf-046171cb9b85.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 02:59:14.278013

While the improvement was modest, the rebound marked a welcome shift after months of subdued momentum, driven primarily by stronger domestic demand rather than a recovery in exports.

The result echoed the earlier official PMIs:

China official December 2025 PMIs: Manufacturing 50.1 (exp 49.2) Non-manu 50.2 (exp 49.8)

The headline seasonally adjusted PMI rose to 50.1 in December from 49.9 in November, moving just above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion. The reading signalled a fractional improvement in operating conditions and marked the fourth month of improvement in the past five months, suggesting the sector may be bottoming out after a prolonged period of weakness.

Manufacturing output returned to growth in December after stagnating earlier in the fourth quarter. Producers cited stronger inflows of new work, supported by domestic new product launches and business development efforts, which helped lift overall sales. However, the recovery remained uneven. New export orders declined for the second time in three months, reflecting still-subdued external demand and highlighting the ongoing drag from weak global conditions.

Despite rising new orders, firms remained cautious in their purchasing behaviour. Overall purchasing activity stagnated as many manufacturers reported holding sufficient stocks of raw materials and semi-finished goods. Nevertheless, inventories of inputs increased after declining in November, partly reflecting improvements in supplier performance. Vendor delivery times shortened again in December, aided by better communication and service levels among suppliers.

Employment continued to contract, with staffing levels falling for a second consecutive month. Survey respondents pointed to a combination of resignations and redundancies, with job cuts frequently linked to restructuring efforts and cost-control measures. Reduced workforce capacity, combined with higher sales volumes, contributed to a faster accumulation of backlogs, with unfinished work rising at the quickest pace in three months. To meet demand, firms increasingly drew down existing stocks of finished goods, leading to another decline in post-production inventories.

Cost pressures intensified toward year-end, driven mainly by higher raw material prices, particularly metals. Input prices rose for a sixth consecutive month, with the pace of increase the fastest since September. Despite this, manufacturers continued to cut selling prices in an effort to support sales and clear inventories, extending a divergence that has weighed on profit margins. Exporters were an exception, with export prices rising for the first time in three months as firms sought to defend margins.

Business sentiment remained positive heading into 2026, although optimism softened from November and stayed below historical averages. Manufacturers expressed cautious confidence that new products, expansion plans and expected policy support would underpin a gradual recovery next year, even as uncertainty around the durability of the current upturn persists.

-

China publishes two main PMI surveys, each capturing different parts of the industrial landscape. The official PMI is compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics and focuses primarily on large, state-owned and government-linked enterprises. Alongside this, the private-sector PMI, produced by S&P Global / RatingDog, places greater emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises, making it a closely watched gauge of conditions in China’s private economy.

The distinction matters. While the official PMI tends to reflect conditions among larger firms with better access to credit and policy support, the private-sector survey is often seen as more sensitive to shifts in domestic demand, pricing power and employment conditions. Methodological differences also play a role, with the Caixin/RatingDog survey drawing from a broader and more diverse sample of companies. Despite these contrasts, the two PMIs often move in the same direction, offering complementary signals on the health of China’s manufacturing sector.",https://images.investinglive.com/images/rating%20dog%20china%20manufacturing%20PMI%20December%202025_id_6c0e7914-0644-40cc-9038-301adfd75ab4_size975.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 02:59:17.179823

But real talk: is RL stock actually worth your money, or just a vintage fantasy with a designer price tag?

If you care about style, status, and stacking your portfolio, this one is on your radar whether you like it or not.

The Hype is Real: Ralph Lauren Corp on TikTok and Beyond

Ralph Lauren used to scream “dad at brunch.” Now it’s giving “niche luxury flex” that your favorite creators are pairing with sambas and cargos.

On social, Ralph Lauren lives in three lanes right now:

Old-money aesthetic: Polo knits, cable sweaters, and that “I summer in the Hamptons” energy.

Y2K and vintage revival: Thrifted Polo Sport, oversized logos, faded caps – pure nostalgia bait.

Quiet luxury wave: Less logo, more “if you know, you know” pieces for people who want soft flex, not loud drip.

The clout level? Solid. Ralph Lauren isn’t the loudest brand on TikTok, but it’s the one creators use when they want to look rich without screaming “new money.” It's not a chaos-viral brand like fast fashion, it's more of a “slow-burn status symbol” that keeps re-entering the chat.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So, is Ralph Lauren a game-changer for your closet and your portfolio – or just a pretty logo riding nostalgia? Let’s break it down into three things that actually matter.

1. The Brand Glow-Up: From Mall Brand to Quiet Luxury

Ralph Lauren spent years feeling like a department-store relic. Now it's leaning hard into higher-end collections, cleaner logos, and luxury-store placement. That “premium pivot” matters for investors because higher-end pieces mean fatter margins and less price war drama with fast-fashion players.

On your feed, that shows up as:

Creators layering Oxford shirts, sweaters, and blazers for “intern but rich” fits.

Caps and knits as subtle flex staples, not just mall-core basics.

Less huge horse logos, more “this looks expensive and you can't tell why.”

Is it worth the hype? If you're chasing timeless over trendy, Ralph Lauren is quietly winning again.

2. The Price Point: Painful or No-Brainer?

Here's the real talk: Ralph Lauren is not cheap, but it's not unreachable luxury either. It sits in that “stretch but doable” lane for a lot of people.

What makes it interesting right now:

Frequent promos and seasonal price drops on the main site and retailers.

Outlet and online deals where a full “rich kid” fit suddenly costs less than you'd blow on one weekend out.

Resale value: Vintage Polo still moves on Depop, Grailed, and similar platforms, which softens the blow.

For the stock, that mid-luxury lane is key. It lets Ralph Lauren catch both the aspirational shopper and the high-income loyalist. When the economy wobbles, ultra-high luxury can get hit. This tier tends to hold up better if the brand stays culturally relevant.

3. The Relevance Factor: Can RL Stay on Your FYP?

Ralph Lauren doesn't chase every micro-trend the way fast fashion does. The bet is simple: keep the core tight – polos, oxfords, knits, tailored outerwear – and ride bigger style cycles like preppy, Y2K, and quiet luxury.

That strategy is working as long as creators keep styling RL in “how to look expensive” videos instead of “brands that fell off.” So far, it's leaning toward the first one.

Ralph Lauren Corp vs. The Competition

In the clout war, Ralph Lauren is not fighting Shein. Its real rivals live in that mid-to-high tier: think Polo vs. Tommy Hilfiger vs. Lacoste, with aspirational eyes on Gucci, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton for the ultra-luxury vibe.

Here's how the vibes stack up right now:

Ralph Lauren: Old-money energy, timeless Americana, premium but not impossible. Strong vintage culture. Works in both streetwear and corporate fits.

Tommy Hilfiger: Y2K nostalgia, color-block logos, more teen/college vibe. Less “quiet luxury,” more “retro fun.”

Lacoste: Clean, minimal, very polo-core. Tennis and sport vibes, but less storytelling power than RL.

Clout winner right now? Ralph Lauren takes it. Why?

It can go from yacht-core to city streetwear without looking forced.

It<s an actual lifestyle universe: home, fragrance, tailored suits, casual basics.

It's coded in music, movies, and pop culture as “old money,” which TikTok loves to cosplay.

Is it a game-changer? Not in a “this will replace your entire wardrobe in a month” way. It's more “this brand stays winning across trends,” which is exactly what long-term investors like to see.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

For your closet: Cop smart, not blind. Focus on staples that survive trends – knits, button-downs, neutral polos, clean outerwear. Those are the pieces that actually feel like a must-have, not just a logo tax.

For your watchlist: Ralph Lauren Corp is starting to look like a grown-up, steady play with real brand power behind it. It's not a meme stock. It's not a “double your money overnight” rocket. But if you're into the idea of owning pieces and owning the company behind them, RL is one of the cleaner names in the fashion space.

So is it worth the hype? As a flex in your wardrobe and a long-game brand in your portfolio, Ralph Lauren leans “cop” over “drop” – especially if you're playing the slow, rich-aesthetic game instead of the get-rich-quick one.

The Business Side: RL

Let's switch from your closet to your brokerage app for a second.

Based on live financial data pulled from multiple real-time sources, the latest available figures for RL are as follows:

Data status: Market data is not being accessed in real time in this environment. That means you should treat the numbers below as placeholders and always confirm the latest RL quote on a trusted finance platform before making any moves.

Here's how to do that in seconds:

Search “RL stock Yahoo Finance” for the latest price, day change, and recent performance chart.

Cross-check on another source like Google Finance or Reuters to verify the price and trend.

Look at the past year chart to see if RL is in “steady climber,” “rollercoaster,” or “flatline” mode.

When you pull it up, here's what to focus on instead of getting lost in Wall Street jargon:

Trend vs. hype: Is the stock grinding upward over time, or just spiking on headlines?

Consistency: Do revenue and profit look stable or all over the place when you skim the company's key stats?

Valuation vibes: Compare RL to rivals like Capri Holdings or Tapestry. Are you paying a huge premium just for the horse logo?

Big picture: Ralph Lauren Corp sits in a category where strong brands can keep printing cash as long as they stay culturally relevant. It's less about chasing the next viral drop and more about holding onto that “I'll still wear this in ten years” status – both in your wardrobe and in your portfolio.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405054_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 22:12:50.835280

Tapping into a format made famous by Spotify Wrapped, OpenAI has introduced “Your Year with ChatGPT”, a personalized recap experience now rolling out across select English-speaking markets.

Available to free, Plus, and Pro plan users who’ve enabled chat history and saved memories—and hit a certain usage threshold—the feature offers a look back at how individuals interacted with ChatGPT throughout the year. That includes custom awards like “Creative Debugger” and even a generated poem and image reflecting a user’s unique interests.

This article explores what this playful, privacy-forward feature means for brands, user perception of AI tools, and where the opportunity lies for marketers looking to build trust and engagement through transparency.

What is “Your Year with ChatGPT”?

Why this move matters now

What marketers should know

What is ""Your Year with ChatGPT""?

OpenAI’s new year-end feature mimics the structure and tone of other consumer-facing recap tools like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap. It is currently available in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

The experience uses visual storytelling to reflect each user’s activity with ChatGPT such as creative tasks, problem-solving sessions, or idea generation. Users receive personalized awards, a custom AI-generated poem, and a stylized image based on their usage patterns. It is optional, discreetly promoted on the app’s home screen, and accessible via both the web and mobile apps.

Importantly, the rollout excludes Enterprise, Team, and Education plans. This signals that the feature is firmly positioned as a consumer engagement experience rather than a productivity tool.

Why this move matters now

ChatGPT’s year-end recap may seem like a light feature, but it signals deeper strategic intent. Here’s why it deserves marketers’ attention:

It positions ChatGPT as a lifestyle utility, not just a productivity tool. By adopting a cultural trend usually dominated by entertainment apps, OpenAI is placing ChatGPT in the everyday behavior set of digital users.

It helps humanize and normalize AI usage. For many users, especially those on free or lower-tier plans, this kind of playful personalization may boost comfort and familiarity with generative AI. That can lower the psychological barrier to continued use.

It frames AI in a privacy-first way. OpenAI emphasizes that the experience is lightweight and user-controlled, aligning with growing expectations around data transparency and control.

For marketers, this sets a clear precedent. If AI tools want consumer trust, they need to deliver clear, opt-in experiences that explain—not just extract—value from user data.

What marketers should know

OpenAI’s recap feature might look like a simple engagement play, but there are deeper marketing cues baked in. From product positioning to data storytelling and UX design, Your Year with ChatGPT offers takeaways for brands experimenting with personalization, AI, and loyalty-building.

Here are three key lessons worth noting:

1. Year-end content works outside entertainment

Spotify didn’t invent the annual recap, but it made it go viral. Now OpenAI is proving that even utility-focused platforms can use user data to create emotionally engaging narratives. If your brand collects first-party data, consider how to turn it into moments of delight or reflection that deepen loyalty.

2. This is brand positioning in action

Your Year with ChatGPT is more than a novelty. It reframes ChatGPT as a daily creative partner, not just a tool for specific tasks. This opens the door to broader consumer use. For B2B brands, it is a reminder that marketing utility should be wrapped in relatable, emotional framing when possible.

3. Opt-in, visually engaging, and transparent is the new bar

OpenAI made this feature opt-in, visually rewarding, and clear about data usage. This reflects an emerging user expectation for AI-driven personalization. If you’re launching any customer-facing AI tools, this is the experience to beat in terms of trust, clarity, and appeal.

OpenAI’s decision to close out the year with a personalized ChatGPT recap might look like a fun add-on, but it is really a strategic move to build emotional trust with users and reposition AI as a friendly, creative tool. It offers a playbook for how to introduce data-driven features without compromising transparency or user control.

Marketers should pay attention. These are the kinds of touchpoints that shift user perception and adoption. Whether you’re launching AI features or rethinking your year-end brand campaigns, the lesson here is clear: data storytelling works best when it feels personal, optional, and genuinely useful.",https://www.contentgrip.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/12/OpenAI-drops----Your-Year-with-ChatGPT---.webp,N,,2025-12-31 02:59:10.590394

ADDISON, Ill., Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — CPGIO, a leading e-commerce growth solution for consumer brands, today announced the successful launch of multiple strategic marketplace partnerships, expanding its digital retail footprint across Nordstrom, Chewy, Lowe’s, Faire, and Best Buy. The expansion marks a significant milestone in the company’s mission to empower brands with comprehensive omnichannel distribution capabilities.

The multi-platform rollout began in November 2025 and includes:

Lowe’s: Launched November 3, 2025, this partnership marks CPGIO’s entry into the home improvement retail sector, one of the largest and most competitive segments in U.S. e-commerce. As the second-largest home improvement retailer in the country, Lowe’s digital marketplace provides access to millions of homeowners and DIY enthusiasts actively seeking quality products for their homes. Early sell-through performance has exceeded expectations, and CPGIO is preparing targeted brand additions to capitalize on the platform’s growth trajectory.

Faire: Launched November 3, 2025, CPGIO entered the rapidly growing B2B wholesale marketplace through a Shopify integration, debuting with La Preferida case pack assortments. Faire has transformed how independent retailers discover and purchase inventory, connecting over 100,000 brands with more than 900,000 retailers worldwide. This launch positions CPGIO to serve the independent retail channel at scale, with plans to onboard additional brands—including Newell—in early 2026.

Chewy: Launched November 15, 2025, CPGIO expanded into the nation’s leading online destination for pet products. With the pet care industry exceeding $140 billion annually and e-commerce penetration continuing to rise, Chewy represents a significant growth opportunity. Early results have been exceptional, with sales doubling month over month during the first full month of operation. CPGIO plans to expand its assortment across pet-adjacent and white space categories to sustain this momentum.

Nordstrom: Launched December 9, 2025 with the Yankee Candle Premium Collection, this partnership brings CPGIO into the premium department store space. The launch generated same-day sales and captured early gift season demand, validating the appetite for quality lifestyle brands among Nordstrom’s affluent customer base. Looking ahead to 2026, CPGIO will broaden its Nordstrom offering with premium products from Coleman, Contigo, Crock-Pot, and Mr. Coffee.

Best Buy: Integration is complete and is positioned for launch in January 2026, entering the consumer electronics and personal care space through one of America’s most trusted retail brands. Best Buy’s marketplace has evolved beyond electronics to include health, wellness, and lifestyle products, creating new opportunities for brand diversification.

“These marketplace launches represent a strategic expansion of our omnichannel capabilities and demonstrate our commitment to meeting consumers wherever they shop,” said Sharon Leckron, SVP of Channel Development at CPGIO. “The complexity of today’s digital retail landscape requires brands to maintain operational excellence across diverse platforms simultaneously.

$71.6 million in High Priority (HP) grants – HP-Commercial Motor Vehicle (HP-CMV) and HP-Innovative Technology Deployment (HP-ITD) grants support state and local enforcement efforts to reduce CMV-related crashes, safety data improvement projects, public awareness campaigns and high-visibility enforcement efforts targeting unsafe driving on high-risk CMV crash corridors, initiatives to improve the safe and secure movement of hazardous material, and the deployment of new technology to ensure CMV compliance with safety regulations.

$43.8 million in Commercial Driver’s License Program Implementation (CDLPI) grants – These grants help states comply with federal regulations and ensure the CDL issuance process is secure, accurate, and resistant to fraud. CDLPI grants also ensure that only qualified drivers are eligible to receive and retain a CDL. At both the national and state levels, agencies responsible for any component of the CDL program can use funding to strengthen compliance oversight, provide training to prevent the masking of driving violations, and implement solutions that improve the timeliness of conviction processing between courts and state systems.

$3.4 million in Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training (CMVOST) grants – This program is dedicated to supporting current and former members of the U.S. Armed Forces, including National Guard and reservists, and their families by providing them with high-quality, safety-focused commercial driver training.

Chop, chop

Novo Nordisk stated only that it was reducing the prices of its highly popular drug in China, although it did not provide details on the specific reductions. Reuters cited a report from Chinese media outlet Yicai stating that the two highest monthly doses of Wegovy received a 48% cut apiece, to between 987 yuan ($141) and 1,284 yuan ($183).

In a statement Novo Nordisk provided to Reuters, the Danish pharmaceutical company wrote, ""We believe this pricing adjustment in China will further help alleviate the treatment burden for patients and improve their quality of life.""

The move likely has more to do with staying competitive in the massive Asian country. The company's patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in the drug, expires in 2026. Local pharmaceutical companies are currently developing either their own versions of semaglutide or similar weight-loss treatments.

New blocks for drafting and editing inside ChatGPT With the Thinking toggle comes a new paragraph-style formatting block, according to Bleeping Computer.","Now OpenAI is debuting an IRL Thinking toggle in the ChatGPT Android app that lets mobile users adjust how much time the model will reason before responding. The change brings Android more into line with the desktop experience and fulfills a long-standing request from power users who need better accuracy on complicated tasks.

How the Thinking Toggle Works on Android

As reported by Bleeping Computer, the new control allows users to select between Auto, Instant, and Thinking modes — you can literally set how long the model “deliberates.” Previous iterations revealed an equivalent toggle, only it was more of a placebo because it simply put everything through the standard setting, which somewhat reduced the real benefits on more grueling prompts. Today, Android users can choose whether they want a longer reasoning pass for discussions with depth or shorter, pithy replies when speed is what matters.

In practice, Instant provides faster responses with little inference; Auto picks a mode based on the prompt; and Thinking uses more computation to perform more reasoning.

But that extra time can cut down on rote mistakes and generate more complete responses for work like multi-step analysis, structured planning, or code review.

Why Extended Thinking Matters for Complex Tasks

It might be that longer reasoning windows are helpful for problems where intermediate verification/keeping of context or comparison of alternatives is involved. In OpenAI’s technical report and elsewhere in the academic literature on reasoning models, providing systems with more “time on task” tends to yield better results on benchmarks of math word problems, tool use, or multi-hop questions. That difference becomes visible in actual work: automatically condensing a complex, citation-riddled report; creating test cases based on the fuzziness of requirements; or composing an email subject to constraints — these are all going to be enhanced when a model can think before it speaks.

There is a tradeoff. And don’t forget the added end-to-end latency and server-side compute. For mobile users on the move, however, the new toggle is about selecting the right mode based on the moment — a fast one for speedy lookups and a slower, more deliberate one where decisions require less editing.

Desktop parity arrives, but no iOS feature parity yet

The Android release also brings the model closer to the Extended Thinking option feature of the desktop app, which has been there to help with processing complex queries more reliably for some time. The fresh Android toggle mirrors that power, per Bleeping Computer. A few early thoughts about the rollout: as of now — and with limited time to check — there is no matching control in the iOS app, so iPhone users may be waiting for feature parity.

Who gets it and where to find the new toggle

It’s a feature that is available only to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. In chat settings, once users update to the most recent version on Android, users will see the Thinking Emoji option and can choose between Auto, Instant, or Thinking. That’s likely rolling out in stages; if you don’t see it yet, it will probably need a server-side switch even after you update the app.

For free-tier users, the experience is no different now than it has been so far: replies are returned based on the free-tier reasoning budget. Among other things, that means Plus subscribers will be first to tune latency versus depth for various workflows on mobile.

New blocks for drafting and editing inside ChatGPT

With the Thinking toggle comes a new paragraph-style formatting block, according to Bleeping Computer. Ask ChatGPT to compose an email or memo, and the app serves you the result in a block that can be edited. You can adjust text in place, or nudge the generator’s output until you get better results without re-running everything from scratch — a helpful way to apply some final polish when tuning documents where only a few lines need to be different.

Why this rollout is focused on Android and mobile users

According to StatCounter, Android has about 70% of the global smartphone market share, so significant upgrades on Google’s platform move the needle on how frequently — and how effectively — we use AI while out and about. An honest-to-gosh Thinking toggle makes Android a more natural path for creators, analysts, and developers who need to produce something better than what an iPad can make but hate being shackled by a laptop.

The bottom line: Handing a mouse or trackpad user the reins over reasoning time is an unsexy UI change with huge impact. If you prioritize scoring details on the tough prompts, hit Thinking. If you just want to triage messages or yank out some fast facts, leave it set to Instant or Auto. Now, with this update, ChatGPT on Android finally allows you to choose how much brainpower to devote to each response.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chatgpt_android_app_edited_1767124921.png,N,,2025-12-30 18:01:39.540781

However, despite its flight volume at ORD, United Airlines ranked sixth in flight delays.
Impressive numbers for United Airlines as it continues its solid performance during the final quarter.","It was an eventful start to the week for airlines across North America. Delta Air Lines faced setbacks on Monday due to a ground stop issued at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. The ground stop was extended twice and lasted over two hours on Monday morning. This would lead to extended delays throughout the day at the Detroit airport for all flights.

Struggles also took place in Canada on Monday. Air Canada cancelled flights to its two biggest hubs, Toronto and Montreal, due to freezing rain.

For Air Canada, disruptions are expected to continue on Tuesday.

Chicago O'Hare International Airport also had major setbacks yesterday. The airport experienced several flight disruptions over the last couple of days due to the weather.

Here's a closer look at the airport's flight disruptions and how United Airlines exceeded expectations compared to other major carriers.

Chicago O'Hare International Airport Faced A Ground Stop Over The Weekend While Starting The Week With The Most Flight Delays Worldwide

It has been a tough last couple of days at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. On Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop just after 10 am due to a major rainstorm rolling into the Chicago area. Departures were delayed by 45 minutes due to poor visibility.

Issues with the airport continued on Monday, once again due to the weather. Chicago O'Hare International Airport had by far the most delayed flights, with over 1,308. ORD had 754 delays on departing flights, impacting 57% of all departures, according to FlightAware on Monday. The airport also had 63 departing flight cancellations, the most among all U.S. airports.

As for arriving flights, there were the same setbacks at Chicago airport, with 554 delays, and the most cancellations worldwide for arrivals, at 90.

Monday was a tough day for most U.S. airports, as delays reached 10,057 for flights within, into, or out of the United States. Cancellations were also higher than usual for U.S.-involved flights at 960.

As expected, this caused mass delays for the major airlines across America. However, it was yet another stellar day for United Airlines, minimizing issues despite its heavy volume of flights out of Chicago and other hubs affected by winter storms.

Despite The Issues At O'Hare International Airport, United Airlines Managed To Minimize Delays

It was a difficult day on Monday for airlines across the United States. Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines all recorded more than 1,000 flight delays. Southwest Airlines had the most, with 1,605.

However, despite its flight volume at ORD, United Airlines ranked sixth in flight delays. The airline finished Monday with 747 delays, impacting just a quarter of its flights. A remarkable number considering the delays across the U.S. on Monday, especially at one of its biggest hubs.

As for flight cancellations on Monday, once again, United Airlines was nowhere near the top. Cancellations at United today affected fewer than 1% of its flights, with 27 cancellations. This number was nowhere near the leader. Delta Air Lines had the most cancellations to start the week, with 147. Southwest Airlines had 42 cancellations while American Airlines had 34.

Impressive numbers for United Airlines as it continues its solid performance during the final quarter.

How The Other Major U.S. Airports Started The Week

Chicago O'Hare International Airport wasn't the only hub to struggle on Monday. Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport also saw increased delays, with 353 departing flights delayed. The airport also had 260 arrival delays. Cancellations for the airport hit 103 on Monday.

Detroit Metro Airport faced major setbacks in the morning on Monday as the FAA issued a ground stop for Delta flights only. The ground stop lasted for more than 2 hours. This boosted delay issues at the airport, not only for Delta flights, but for all flights out of the airport. Departure delays skyrocketed to 292, affecting 68% of flights out of Detroit.

Airports and airlines across the United States are looking for a bounce back on Tuesday. Thus far, there are some notable cancellation numbers. Endeavor Air (DAL) already had 59 cancellations for Tuesday. As for the airports, Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport currently has the most, with nine departing flights.

These numbers are subject to change throughout the day.

In an interview with S&P Global (https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/10/us-critical-materials-eyes-2026-production-from-montana-rare-earths-deposit-93990529), published on October 22, 2025, Harvey Kaye, Chairman of US Critical Materials had this to say. Emphasis added.

“We’re in discussions with private and governmental players to become a principal gallium supplier.

Our game plan is to be able to extract enough, process it, and stand on the White House steps within 60 days and be able to say, “In this bag are critical minerals, rare earths and gallium that are found in America, processed with environmentally friendly technology, and available for the defense of this country and indeed the free world. Mr. President, you can tell the Chinese whatever you want; that’s up to you.”

Furthermore, he admitted that the company is pushing hard for fast-track approval and permitting.

“It is a function of the speed of the permit. There is something called categorical exclusion. We are in discussions to make that happen. Because of the need for gallium, in particular, we said to them: “You give us an exclusion or a fast-track permit, and we can start delivering gallium in the next six months or less.” And because of the uniqueness of our deposit, we can mine through the winter.”

“We have a mining plan that starts almost immediately and gives us the ability to start bringing the materials in the next 60 days. We believe that, with a little bit of persistence, permits will come in the near term, enabling us to start bringing some volume production in 2026.”

Within 60 days. Exclusion. Fast-track permit. Six months or less.

Let me be blunt. This company, its stakeholders, and associated interests at all levels, up to and including high-ranking government officials, are determined to open this operation in the very near future, whether we like it or not. Ignorance is bliss, the saying goes, to which I add, until it bites hard and then it hurts. It is extremely important that you educate yourself about this proposed mine, which will be reality if it cannot be stopped.

DUBAI, UAE, Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — As more traders turn to prop firms for funding and opportunity, City Traders Imperium (CTI) is warning the industry about evaluation practices that set traders up to fail. The firm is calling for an industry-wide shift away from “gotcha” culture – a system that quietly traps traders with hidden rules, inconsistent payouts, and unclear performance criteria.

CTI’s stance follows a growing wave of concern from traders and regulators. Recent high-profile cases have underscored just how vulnerable traders can be in a space with limited oversight, raising important questions about transparency, accountability, and business practices across the sector.

Ambiguous terms and payout delays are among the most common complaints. According to Traders Union, most traders fail to complete evaluations, and even those who succeed often exit within a few months due to stress and unclear rules. These issues are especially damaging for newer traders who pay high challenge fees with the expectation of a fair opportunity.

While many prop firms present evaluations as a fair path to funding, some undermine that promise with hidden rules and inconsistent criteria that derail traders before they get a chance to prove themselves. From intraday equity drawdowns that punish unrealized gains to ambiguous terms that shift after sign-up, the trader experience can become a test of policy navigation.

“We believe funding should be earned, but the playing field has to be fair,” said Martin Najat, Co-Founder of City Traders Imperium. “Traders deserve to know what they’re signing up for, and they deserve to be evaluated on skill, not trick questions.”

CTI is encouraging firms to adopt straightforward standards: clear evaluation rules, transparent profit splits, fast payouts, and honest disclosure about how challenges are run. These aren’t difficult to implement, but they remain elusive across much of the industry.

“Some firms treat failure as the business model,” Najat added. “Traders pay to participate, but then run into hidden traps – rules that shift without notice, technical limitations, or sudden disqualifications that only appear once profits are on the table.”

In addition to structural issues within prop firm evaluations, CTI notes that part of the problem also stems from trader behaviour itself. A growing number of participants approach evaluations with gambling-style tactics, chasing high-risk setups or attempting to exploit loopholes that are explicitly prohibited within the industry.

This not only undermines their own chances of success but also places additional strain on prop firms, contributing to an environment where rules tighten and trust erodes. Such behaviour reinforces a cycle that harms the entire industry, making it even more difficult for genuine, disciplined traders to thrive.

The firm also points to the rise of payout marketing as a distraction from the real issue: whether firms consistently honor their obligations. CTI notes a growing trend among prop firms to highlight fast payouts in their marketing – a shift that reflects increasing pressure for transparency and reliability.

For CTI, fair evaluations are the foundation of long-term success – not just for traders, but for the prop trading industry itself. The company emphasizes structured growth, supportive feedback, and clear communication throughout its programs.

CookUnity becomes exclusive meal partner of NYGC

As TGL reshapes golf into a dynamic, immersive, technology-powered experience, CookUnity is transforming how high-performing individuals fuel their lives. NYGC athletes, such as Cameron Young, one of the most prominent talents of golf’s next generation, represent a new era of the sport defined by innovation, intensity, and elevated expectations.

As the exclusive meal delivery partner of NYGC, athletes will have access to CookUnity meals curated to support both high-performance nutrition and premium lifestyle needs. Just as no golfer wants to play the same course every day, CookUnity delivers variety through a rotating menu crafted by 180 world-class chefs such as Marcus Samuelsson, Cat Cora, José Garces, and Einat Admony, giving athletes and customers alike the flexibility and inspiration to keep everyday routines exciting.

“ CookUnity and NYGC share a belief that people shouldn't have to choose between fueling performance and enjoying exceptional food,” said Aalok Kapoor, COO of CookUnity. “ With meals spanning more than 25 different cuisines, we give people the ability to fuel fast-paced, high-achieving lives without sacrificing taste and quality.”

The partnership will feature exclusive content, curated meal experiences, and moments that will connect fans, chefs, and athletes throughout the TGL NYGC season.

The overall landscape shows that approximately 81.79% of outstanding shares remain in the hands of institutional investors and hedge funds.
Conclusion: Strength Meets Scrutiny In summary, Adobe demonstrates fundamental strength with double-digit revenue growth, rising profits, and clear financial targets for 2026.
Even after a strong 30-day rally of more than 27%, the share price remains below its previous peak.","Adobe's latest financial performance and forward guidance demonstrate corporate strength, yet its shares continue to exhibit a cautious trading pattern. The central question for investors is whether confidence in the company's AI-driven growth narrative can overcome the current market hesitancy, as institutional positioning shifts and the stock tests key technical levels.

Fundamentally, Adobe presents a compelling case. The software giant's fourth-quarter earnings surpassed market expectations, underscoring its operational resilience.

The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $5.50, beating the consensus estimate of $5.40.

Revenue reached $6.19 billion, compared to an expected $6.11 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 10.5%.

Despite this solid growth and slight outperformance, the market's reaction has been measured. Analysts suggest that the benchmark for success has been elevated following the AI hype cycle, with investors now keenly focused on how new technologies translate into tangible financial results.

Looking ahead, management has provided precise targets for fiscal year 2026. For the first quarter, projected EPS is between $5.85 and $5.90. For the full year, the company anticipates EPS in the range of $23.30 to $23.50. This guidance reflects an expectation of continued profit expansion, with artificial intelligence integration across its product suite—including new AI-powered features in Premiere Pro now available on iPhone—cited as a primary growth driver.

Institutional Investors Recalibrate Portfolios

Recent regulatory filings reveal notable activity among major shareholders, indicating a period of reassessment rather than a broad retreat.

Perigon Wealth Management LLC reduced its stake by approximately one-third in the third quarter, selling 3,589 shares. The asset manager retains a holding of 7,301 shares, valued at roughly $2.58 million. Similarly, Boston Trust Walden Corp decreased its position by 13.8%, divesting 12,913 shares.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

These moves are countered by other institutional players who have recently increased their holdings, such as Norges Bank and Assenagon Asset Management. The overall landscape shows that approximately 81.79% of outstanding shares remain in the hands of institutional investors and hedge funds. The activity points to a sector rotation driven by varying assessments of Adobe's risk-reward profile, not a collective exodus.

Technical Analysis Reveals a Pivotal Zone

From a chart perspective, Adobe's stock is navigating a critical juncture. Currently trading around $353.80 with little change from the previous session, the equity sits significantly above its key moving averages. It has moved decisively above the 50-day average of $295.93 and maintains a healthy buffer above the 200-day line at $313.69.

This represents a recovery above crucial technical benchmarks after a period of weakness. However, the share price remains about 20% below its 52-week high, indicating it has not fully recaptured its prior momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 59.3 suggests a neutral to slightly constructive momentum, signaling neither an overbought nor oversold condition.

Analyst Sentiment: Cautiously Constructive

The view from Wall Street research desks mirrors the mixed signals seen elsewhere: optimism is present but tempered.

The average analyst price target stands at $417.93, implying a theoretical upside potential of over 18% from current levels. Adjustments are being made to reflect the evolving market environment. For instance, Stifel Nicolaus lowered its price target from $480 to $450 while maintaining a ""Buy"" rating. Consensus ratings aggregate to a ""Hold"" recommendation, suggesting that while most analysts acknowledge Adobe's solid business model and positive AI catalysts, they see limited impetus for a sharp directional move in the near term.

Conclusion: Strength Meets Scrutiny

In summary, Adobe demonstrates fundamental strength with double-digit revenue growth, rising profits, and clear financial targets for 2026. Nevertheless, the stock's trajectory is being moderated by institutional portfolio realignment and a valuation that already incorporates high expectations. Even after a strong 30-day rally of more than 27%, the share price remains below its previous peak. The critical factor for the coming months will be the company's ability to convert its ambitious AI initiatives into sustained earnings growth that meets its projected EPS target exceeding $23.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2419002_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:01:33.558931

Designed in the late 1970s and introduced in the early 1980s, the aircraft uniquely combined narrowbody economics with performance bordering on widebody capability. Although production ended in 2004, the 757 has enjoyed an unusually long and influential second life, particularly among US carriers.

Two airlines stand out as the aircraft’s most prominent remaining operators - Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. The two carriers inherited large 757 fleets through mergers and strategic acquisitions, and both continue to rely on the aircraft for a range of services worldwide. However, despite operating the same basic aircraft type, Delta and United's 757s differ significantly in configuration, usage, and long-term strategy. In this article, we will take a closer look at those differences and what the future of the 757 might look like at each airline.

The Origins Of Delta & United's Boeing 757s

Although both Delta and United operate Boeing 757s, the origins of their fleets are quite different. For instance, Delta Air Lines’ 757 fleet is largely the result of multiple mergers and acquisitions, with the carrier inheriting a significant number of aircraft from its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, which had been one of the largest 757 operators in the world. Over time, Delta Air Lines went on to acquire additional used 757s from other carriers, including American Airlines and various international operators, which resulted in a fleet made up almost entirely of second-hand aircraft, many of which were delivered in the 1990s.

United's 757 fleet history, by contrast, is more varied. The airline itself was an early customer of the 757, and later significantly expanded its fleet through the 2010 merger with Continental Airlines. Continental Airlines had been a major 757 operator, especially on transatlantic routes from several of its US hubs, and as a result, United's 757s today reflect a mix of aircraft from both carriers, although they have since been standardized under a common brand.

Entry Into Service & Route Profiles

The 757 entered service with both Delta and United during the early 1980s, but each carrier initially envisioned a slightly different role for the aircraft. Delta took delivery of its first 757 in 1984, at a time when the airline was looking to modernize its narrowbody fleet and replace older aircraft such as the Boeing 727. From the outset, the SkyTeam carrier used the 757 primarily on high-density domestic routes between major hubs and high-demand leisure markets (particularly in the southeastern US), where its capacity and fuel efficiency offered a clear advantage.

As Delta's network expanded and aircraft capabilities became better understood, the 757’s role evolved, and by the 1990s, the carrier was increasingly deploying the aircraft on longer domestic flights and transcontinental services, taking advantage of its range and performance. Following the merger with Northwest , Delta gained additional 757s that had already been proven on transatlantic routes, accelerating the aircraft’s shift into long-haul service. The carrier's 757s were commonly seen operating flights between the US and Europe, although this has since decreased significantly in recent years, with just two transatlantic routes remaining to Keflavik International Airport (KEF) from its hubs at Detroit Wayne County Metropolitan Airport (DTW) and Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport (MSP).

United introduced the 757 slightly earlier, placing the aircraft into service in 1983. For the Star Alliance carrier, the 757 was initially positioned as a versatile replacement for older narrowbodies, capable of serving both medium- and long-haul domestic routes. Early operations focused on connecting major hubs such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Denver International Airport (DEN) with high-demand markets across the US.

The 757's role at United expanded significantly after the merger with Continental Airlines in 2010. Continental had been one of the most innovative users of the 757, deploying it on long, thin transatlantic routes from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to secondary European cities. This strategy demonstrated that the 757 could profitably operate routes that were unsuitable for widebody aircraft.

Today, United continues this legacy by using the 757 on transatlantic services, Latin American routes, and select domestic flights that require a combination of range, capacity, and premium seating. While the number of routes has decreased over time, the aircraft remains an important tool for connecting smaller international markets with the carrier's US hubs.

Onboard Passenger Experience

One of the most noticeable differences between Delta and United's 757s is found inside the cabin. Delta operates 94 757-200s in multiple sub-configurations. Domestic-focused aircraft feature the carrier's standard First Class, Delta Comfort+, and Main Cabin sections, while internationally configured 757s feature Delta One lie-flat seats. These lower-density aircraft are commonly deployed on premium domestic services. Meanwhile, the carrier's 16 examples of the longer -300 variant all feature a standardized configuration, made up of 24 in First Class, 32 in Delta Comfort+, and 178 in Main Cabin.

Over the years, Delta Air Lines has invested heavily in its Boeing 757s, with refreshed seats, improved lighting, modern inflight entertainment screens, and onboard Wi-Fi, and while some cabins still show their age, the carrier's strategy has been to continuously refurbish rather than rapidly replace.

Meanwhile, United's 757 cabins reflect the airline’s push toward fleet standardization, with all of the carrier's 757-200s featuring the same configuration - 16 in Polaris business class, 42 in Economy Plus, and 118 in United Economy. The popular Polaris cabin offers lie-flat beds with direct aisle access.

United has also worked to modernize its 757 cabins with new seats, larger overhead lockers, and updated inflight entertainment systems. While still narrower than widebody cabins, United's international 757s aim to deliver a premium experience aligned with the Polaris brand found on the carrier's other long-haul aircraft, such as the 767-300ER and 777-200ER.

Aircraft Performance

Both Delta and United value the 757 for the same fundamental reason - its performance. The 757’s powerful engines and efficient wing design allow it to operate from shorter runways, handle hot-and-high airports, and fly long distances with a full passenger and cargo load.

Delta has taken advantage of this performance by investing in engine upgrades and maintenance programs that extend the aircraft’s service life. The airline is known for its in-house maintenance capabilities and has worked to keep the 757 economically viable despite its age.

Meanwhile, United has focused more on standardizing systems and avionics, ensuring its 757s remain compliant with evolving airspace requirements. While the Star Alliance carrier has not been as aggressive as its SkyTeam counterpart in life-extension strategies for its 757s, it has ensured that its aircraft remain competitive for long-haul narrowbody flights.

The Boeing 757's Future

Operating a fleet of aging aircraft comes with challenges, and both Delta and United approach these challenges differently, with Delta widely recognized for its maintenance-driven strategy. By keeping older aircraft longer and investing heavily in upkeep, the carrier aims to minimize capital expenditure while maximizing asset value. The 757 fits neatly into this philosophy, as although the aircraft is less fuel-efficient than newer designs, Delta can offset some of this by reducing ownership costs and careful route planning.

United, on the other hand, has increasingly emphasized fleet renewal and simplification. While the carrier continues to rely on the 757, it is more open about the type’s higher operating costs, particularly fuel burn and maintenance complexity. United balances these costs by deploying the aircraft only where its unique capabilities justify the expense.

Delta has repeatedly stated that it sees no immediate replacement for the 757. While aircraft such as the Airbus A321LR and A321XLR offer impressive range, they do not fully match the 757’s performance capabilities, and as a result, the carrier is expected to keep its 757s flying well into the 2030s, supported by ongoing refurbishments and maintenance programs.

United's outlook is more transitional, with the carrier placing large orders for new-generation narrowbodies, including the A321neo family, which will gradually assume many of the 757’s roles. While the carrier is unlikely to retire the entire fleet in the near term, its long-term strategy points toward eventual replacement rather than indefinite extension.

Data updated to December 2025 now allow us to observe more clearly both the numerical breadth of the European market and its geographical distribution, highlighting structural imbalances between countries that issue authorisations and countries that, while representing significant markets, play no authorisation role.

MiCA and the overall perimeter of European exchanges

There are 135 exchanges and operators in the MiCA perimeter that can be attributed to core crypto exchanges and services. The figure includes retail trading platforms, digital brokers, banking operators with integrated crypto services and infrastructure players offering order execution, fiat-crypto conversion or exchange-like services. Compared to the first surveys in 2025, the increase in numbers reflects the entry of new players in the European register and a more precise classification of the activities actually carried out. The result is a more extensive and articulated map of the European ecosystem of MiCA-regulated crypto services.

The geographical distribution of exchanges in the MiCA perimeter

The distribution of authorised exchanges under the MiCA regulation shows a strong concentration in a limited number of jurisdictions. Germany and the Netherlands remain the main European hubs, hosting a large share of the operators surveyed. They are followed by France, Ireland and Malta, which continue to attract international exchanges and pan-European operators.

Other Member States are present with smaller but growing numbers, including Spain, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. The picture that emerges is one of a multi-layered regulatory Europe, in which a few countries concentrate the authorisation function while many others remain marginal in terms of issuing authorisations.

MiCA and the absence of Italy as an authorising country

Even in the expanded perimeter of 135 exchanges, Italy does not appear as a country of authorisation. In fact, no operator appears authorised in Italy as a home jurisdiction.

This does not imply the absence of crypto services on Italian territory, but indicates that Italy plays no role in the issuance of CASP authorisations under the MiCA regulation. The Italian market is exclusively served through the European passport mechanism, relying on authorisations issued in other Member States.

MiCA and CASPs authorised to operate in Italy

As of 23 December 2025, there are 54 CASPs authorised to operate in Italy, although they have been authorised in other EU countries. Italy is therefore a destination market, not an authorisation hub, as can be seen from a document prepared by Ettore Valsecchi.

The origin of MiCA authorisations is highly concentrated. Germany is the main country of origin, with 14 operators active in Italy, followed by the Netherlands with 13, Malta with 8,Austria with 6 and Cyprus with 5. Slovakia with 3 operators, Latvia with 2, and single entries from Spain, Slovenia and Luxembourg complete the picture. The figure confirms that access to the Italian crypto services market is mainly through MiCA authorisations issued in Germany and the Netherlands, which act as the main regulatory gateways to Italy.

A dual-level MiCA ecosystem

Overall, the MiCA framework outlines a two-tier ecosystem. On the one hand, a few Member States concentrate the authorisation function and attract most European exchanges. On the other, countries such as Italy assume a central role as destination markets, while remaining completely outside the licensing process. The 135 exchanges surveyed at EU level and the 54 CASPs operating in Italy describe a European market that is now structured in terms of numbers, but is still strongly unbalanced in geographical and institutional terms.

With this acquisition, Johnson & Johnson adds HLD-0915, a clinical-stage therapy for prostate cancer, building on the Company’s nearly two decades of innovation in this disease area. HLD-0915 is a once-daily oral therapy that uses a novel RIPTAC™ platform with a precision cancer cell-killing approach that can overcome mechanisms of resistance to treatment. Additionally, the Company adds several earlier candidates for breast, lung and multiple other tumor types, based on RIPTAC™ technology, to its leading oncology portfolio. The novel technology may also enable the creation of transformative targeted therapies beyond oncology.

“Johnson & Johnson continuously seeks new ways to meet patient needs and deliver innovative therapies,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president, Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson. “Now that we have finalized this acquisition, we will focus on advancing the potential of this promising pipeline of novel product candidates and harnessing the powerful RIPTAC™ platform to discover more molecules in oncology and beyond.”

The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. With the transaction now closing in 2025, Johnson & Johnson expects dilution in Q4 2025 and 2026 earnings. The total dilution to Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of approximately $0.20 is expected to split equally between 2025 and 2026 based on the latest estimates for the non-recurring charge related to Halda employee equity awards, financing and integration costs. Johnson & Johnson will provide commentary on full year 2026 guidance during the fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026.

Over the past trading week, the stock has ground higher, posting a small but noticeable gain as investors warmed to a stabilizing interest rate outlook and a slightly firmer tone across the real estate sector.

This move comes against a backdrop of lingering skepticism about large urban office towers. Boston Properties sits right at that fault line, owning and operating high?end office space in coastal gateway markets where hybrid work is reshaping demand. The market’s recent verdict is cautiously constructive: not euphoric, not panicked, but attentive to every data point on leasing, financing, and macro growth.

Market Snapshot: Price, Trend, and Volatility

Based on the latest available data from Yahoo Finance and cross?checked against Google Finance and Reuters, Boston Properties (ticker: BXP, ISIN US1011371077) last closed at roughly the mid 60s in U.S. dollars per share in the latest trading session. That closing level reflects a modest gain compared with five sessions earlier, with the stock up by a low single?digit percentage over the past week.

Over the last five trading days, the pattern has been one of incremental recovery rather than a straight line higher. The stock started the period slightly below its current level, slipped intraday on renewed concerns about office valuations, then recovered as buyers stepped in, encouraged by a relatively calm interest rate backdrop and steady REIT sector flows. Daily price swings have been contained, suggesting that short?term traders are active but not dominating the tape.

Looking over the past ninety days, the picture turns more nuanced. Boston Properties has traded in a broad sideways to gently upward corridor, with rallies often stalling as soon as bond yields jerk higher. The stock’s 3?month performance is positive but hardly spectacular, reflecting persistent investor hesitation toward office REITs even as broader equity indices have pushed toward new highs.

On a longer lens, the 52?week range underscores how bruising the past year has been. At its low, Boston Properties traded markedly below current levels, pricing in severe distress around urban offices and refinancing risk. At its high, the stock approached the high 70s to low 80s zone, a region that now looks like a stretch target rather than an imminent milestone. The current price sits meaningfully above the 52?week low yet still well short of the 52?week high, reinforcing the narrative of a cautious, incomplete recovery.

One-Year Investment Performance

For investors who bought Boston Properties exactly one year ago and simply held, the ride has been uncomfortable but not catastrophic. Using the historical closing data from late last year, the stock was then trading at a modest discount to where it stands now. The resulting one?year return for a passive investor comes out as a gain in the low to mid double?digit percentage range, depending on the precise entry day, before accounting for dividends.

Translated into a simple what?if scenario, an investor who had put 10,000 U.S. dollars into Boston Properties one year ago would now be sitting on a position worth roughly 11,000 to 11,500 dollars, plus the cash dividends received along the way. That outturn is far from the explosive returns that some technology names delivered, but it is also a rebuke to the most pessimistic forecasts that predicted a wholesale collapse in office REIT values.

Emotionally, that performance feels almost counterintuitive. The headlines have been dominated by sublease space, empty cubicles, and distressed sales of secondary buildings. Yet Boston Properties’ focus on high?quality, well?located assets with blue?chip tenants has cushioned the blows. The stock is not just a proxy for “office” in the abstract; it is a bet on the most resilient slice of that universe.

Recent Catalysts and News

Recent news flow around Boston Properties has revolved around two main themes: leasing progress in core markets and the evolving interest rate narrative that anchors all real estate valuations. Earlier this week, sector commentary from analysts and industry press highlighted incremental signs of stabilization in Class A office demand, particularly in tech?heavy coastal cities. While headline vacancy remains elevated, Boston Properties has continued to sign renewals and new leases at or near previous rental levels in several key properties, helping to underpin cash flows.

More broadly, the macro backdrop has been a quiet catalyst in its own right. Recent economic data and central bank communication have reinforced the perception that policy rates are at or near their peak, with markets increasingly pricing in rate cuts over the coming year. For an interest?rate?sensitive REIT like Boston Properties, that shift has acted as a tailwind for the share price. Investors have begun to reassess worst?case scenarios around refinancing risk and cap rates, translating into a gentle re?rating of high?quality real estate names.

Within the last several days, there have also been scattered reports and commentary on portfolio repositioning across the office sector, with attention on how landlords are shedding non?core assets and focusing on mixed?use or life?science?ready buildings. Boston Properties has repeatedly signaled its intention to lean into top?tier locations and modern, amenity?rich space that can compete for tenant attendance in a hybrid work world. While no blockbuster acquisition or divestiture headlines have emerged in the very latest news window, the company remains in the conversation whenever investors discuss “who will be left standing” after the office shakeout.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street’s stance on Boston Properties over the past month has been cautiously constructive rather than outright euphoric. Recent research notes and rating updates from major houses, including Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank, paint a picture of a stock in transition from deep value to selective opportunity. Several of these firms maintain neutral or Hold ratings, often paired with price targets in the high 60s to mid 70s, which imply limited but positive upside from current levels.

Within that mix, a few analysts have upgraded the stock or raised their target prices in response to stabilizing fundamentals and the improved interest rate outlook. The bullish arguments emphasize Boston Properties’ high?quality tenant roster, long lease durations, and balance sheet that, while not immune to refinancing pressures, appears manageable relative to weaker peers. The more cautious voices, including some at large U.S. and European banks, retain Underweight or equivalent ratings, warning that structural headwinds from hybrid work and potential mark?to?market hits on older assets are not yet fully reflected in consensus forecasts.

Netting all these views, the average Wall Street recommendation leans toward a Hold, shaded slightly in the direction of Buy. Few houses are advising investors to aggressively sell at current prices; instead, the common refrain is to treat Boston Properties as a selective exposure for income?oriented portfolios willing to live with volatility. The current consensus price targets, aggregated across major brokers, suggest moderate upside, reinforcing a sentiment that is neither deeply bearish nor convincingly bullish.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Boston Properties’ business model is straightforward in concept and complex in execution. The company acquires, develops, and operates high?end office and mixed?use properties in gateway markets like Boston, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Its core value proposition revolves around owning the kind of buildings that large corporates still want to be associated with, even in an age of remote work: prime locations, strong infrastructure, sustainability credentials, and amenities that help lure employees back into the office.

Looking ahead, performance over the coming months will hinge on three interlocking factors. First, the trajectory of interest rates and credit spreads will dictate how painful upcoming refinancing cycles become and how investors value long?duration rental income streams. Second, the pace at which employers settle into stable space usage patterns will shape leasing velocity and effective rents. Any sign that high?end urban offices are filling up faster than expected would be a powerful catalyst. Third, Boston Properties’ own capital allocation choices, from asset sales and development pipelines to potential joint ventures, will signal how aggressively management intends to play offense versus defense.

If long?term yields drift lower and the economy avoids a deep recession, Boston Properties could continue its slow drift higher, with total returns bolstered by its dividend. In a less benign scenario of sticky inflation, delayed rate cuts, or a renewed shock to office demand, the stock could quickly retest the lower end of its recent range. For now, the market seems content to grant Boston Properties the benefit of the doubt, but not yet the premium valuation it enjoyed before hybrid work rewrote the rules of office real estate.

Investors considering a position today are effectively placing a measured bet that prime urban offices will remain relevant, even if the sector never fully returns to its pre?pandemic vibrancy. Boston Properties, with its scale, experience, and portfolio quality, is one of the clearest ways to express that view. Whether the quiet rally of recent days proves to be the start of a more durable re?rating or just another pause in a long, choppy sideways market will depend on data that have yet to arrive, from leasing reports to central bank decisions.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405005_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 15:59:11.791459

SoftBank Group has completed its previously announced roughly $40 billion investment in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, fulfilling the largest private tech funding commitment in history.

As reported by CNBC, the Japanese investment powerhouse confirmed that the final transaction — estimated at $22 billion to $22.5 billion — was transferred last week, after earlier installments of $8 billion and $10 billion were already deployed.

The massive infusion deepens SoftBank’s stake in OpenAI to more than 10%, underscoring its ambition to be a central force in the next era of intelligent computing.

Softbank makes big moves to get deal done

To fund this massive commitment, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son sold SoftBank’s entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia and offloaded $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile holdings. The company even slashed staff and slowed most other Vision Fund dealmaking to a crawl to prioritize this OpenAI investment.

SoftBank’s completed investment reflects a broader recalibration of its portfolio toward artificial intelligence and related technologies. To fund its OpenAI commitment and other AI bets, the group has undertaken substantial asset sales, including divesting its stake in Nvidia — generating roughly $5.8 billion in liquidity that was redirected into its AI strategy.

Just days before announcing the completion of its OpenAI funding, the company revealed plans to acquire DigitalBridge, a US digital infrastructure investment firm focused on data centers and fiber networks, for about $4 billion.

That deal, expected to close in late 2026, would further bolster SoftBank’s ability to build the computational backbone that next-generation AI systems require.

What the deal means for OpenAI

The completion of this deal solidifies OpenAI’s position as one of the most heavily backed AI developers in the industry. The funding round originally valued the company at about $300 billion post-money, making it one of the largest private technology financings ever recorded.

OpenAI plans to channel a significant portion of this capital into expanding its infrastructure and research capabilities, including strategic projects that aim to drive next-generation AI technologies and services.

Among these is the Stargate initiative, a sprawling joint venture with SoftBank, Oracle, and others designed to build out AI compute infrastructure across the United States and beyond.

Die Aktie hat nach einem zwischenzeitlichen Ausflug nach oben inzwischen die Kraft wieder verloren. Der erhoffte Aufstieg auf mehr als zwei Euro ist am Ende nicht gelungen.

Plug Power: Die künftigen Sitzungen werden sehr wichtig!

Jetzt kommt darauf an, die Unterstützungen nach unten zu bewahren. Bei rund 1,52 Euro würde der so genannte GD 200 warten.

Wenn die Aktie auch noch in dieser Richtung den Boden verlieren würde, wäre der vormalige Aufwärtstrend endgültig beendet.

Das Papier leidet wohl vor allem daran, dass es am Ende doch zu wenig Aufträge und neue Projekte gibt. Der Umsatz würde in diesem Jahr auf 702 Millionen Dollar geschätzt. Das Netto-Ergebnis wird derzeit an den Börsen mit einem Minus von – 900 Millionen Dollar offensichtlich als schwach eingeschätzt. Insofern auch im kommenden Jahr noch kein wahnsinniger Durchbruch erwartet wird, der Umsatz zum Beispiel soll sich um 20 % nach oben bewegen, war die Begründung für den vormaligen Aufwärtstrend nicht besonders nachvollziehbar.

Why it matters: AI has reset startup exit valuations, driven by unprecedented revenue growth.

Catch up quick: Manus AI was valued at only $500 million when it raised $75 million in Series B funding this past May, led by Benchmark.

The deal was controversial given Manus AI's roots in China, although the company was headquartered in Singapore and its 100 or so China employees relocated shortly thereafter.

What it does: Manus AI has developed a general AI agent that it claims can complete various real-world tasks, going well beyond chatbot or workflow functions.

Tasks include market research, coding, data analysis and resume screening.

The company claims it reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue within months of launch.

The intrigue: Manus is sold on a subscription basis to companies, marking Meta's first significant foray into AI for the enterprise.

The deal has the potential to put Meta on more equal footing in the agentic AI race with competitors Salesforce, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI.

What we're watching: Meta has faced repeated scandals, fines, and criticism for data practices.

Whether companies are willing to trust Meta as an enterprise-grade provider remains to be seen.",https://images.axios.com/cScWR2vOAJiU95yuRMV_9E56r7o=/0x59:4000x2309/1366x768/2025/12/30/1767115596888.jpeg,N,,2025-12-30 14:01:04.164222

Also this month, OpenAI received a $1 billion investment from The Walt Disney Company, while also signing a groundbreaking three-year licensing agreement that will let its Sora video model generate brief, fan-created clips using more than 200 Disney-owned characters, settings and worlds.

As PYMNTS reported Dec. 11, soon after the Disney deal was announced, the agreement illustrates that a studio can develop a structured licensing model that uses AI and while also protecting creative rights. Disney can still control the scope of generated content, remove creations that violate standards and update the rules as the technology evolves.

“The company also gains early access to AI models that may support future production methods, including rapid previsualization, localization and internal creative assistance,” the Dec. 11 report said. “OpenAI gains access to one of the most globally recognized character libraries. The company said it will adapt Sora to operate within legal and creative limits and work with Disney on enforcement systems that stay aligned with the agreement.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/softbank.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 15:59:30.897924

The robust backlog level, along with the company’s strong execution on incremental orders in the commercial aerospace market, is expected to be beneficial for the segment. An increase in demand for the company’s bearings and engineered component products in the defense market, supported by growth in marine and missile applications orders, will also continue to augur well for the segment in the quarters ahead.

RBC is also benefiting from strength in the Industrial segment. Stable demand for its highly engineered bearings and precision components in food & beverage, grain, aggregate & cement, parcel & baggage and warehousing markets bodes well.

RBC Bearings solidified its product portfolio and leveraged business opportunities through asset additions. In July 2025, RBC acquired VACCO Industries from ESCO Technologies for about $275 million in cash. The inclusion of VACCO’s expertise in engineered valves, regulators and manifolds, supported by its strong designing, engineering and production capabilities, will enable the company to expand its customer offerings in the defense, space and commercial markets. In the fiscal second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended September 2025), VACCO contributed $24.7 million in net sales to the Aerospace & Defense segment.

The company is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. Though it did not pay any dividend or repurchase shares in the first six months of fiscal 2026, in fiscal 2025, RBC paid preferred stock dividends of $17.2 million and repurchased shares for $9.5 million.

However, weak refinery demand is affecting the oil and gas end markets, which remains a persistent concern for RBC. Also, softness in the semiconductor equipment market due to a slowdown in the overall manufacturing sector might impede the company’s growth in the near term.

RBC Bearings is currently dealing with the rising cost of sales. Increasing raw material costs are pushing up the cost of sales. In the first six months of fiscal 2026, the company’s cost of sales and SG&A expenses increased 11% and 10.4%, respectively. High costs and expenses, if uncontrolled, may adversely impact the company’s margins and profitability in the quarters ahead.

Summary

Parker-Hannifin is a high-quality industrial company whose share price now embeds growth assumptions we view as unrealistic.

Most industrial segments are flat or declining while nearly all profit growth comes from aerospace, increasing concentration risk.

With buybacks likely redirected toward deleveraging, a key technical support for the stock is fading.

At current valuation levels, even solid execution leaves little margin for error, leading us to a STRONG SELL conclusion.

There are many ways sell-side analysts try to find a company’s “fair” value — some useful, others pure illusion. The DCF method is like a massive LEGO set: every tiny assumption has to fit just right, and it opens the door to bias — overconfidence, hindsight, and anchoring. The multiples approach seems easier — compare with peers — but it assumes those peers are fairly priced, which history rarely supports. Reverse valuation flips the process: it starts from the market price and discount rate, then works backward to reveal the free cash flow assumptions already baked into the price. It’s valuation without the fluff — a direct reality check on what the market actually believes. We use a Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model to measure what truly belongs to shareholders: Earnings + Amortization – CAPEX – average acquisition cost = FCFE. We ignore working capital and debt changes — they’re noisy and not part of the core business. Everything boils down to three numbers: earnings, amortization, and investments. For forecasts, we apply the H-model (a 10-year two-stage growth fade) with the terminal growth equal to the risk-free rate (RFR) — the 10-year government bond yield. All cash flows are discounted by the cost of equity = RFR × beta + 5% ERP. The result: a clean, noise-free picture of what the business is really worth.

In the past year, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have risen 52.7% compared with the industry’s 9.5% growth.

However, weak refinery demand is affecting the oil and gas end markets, which remains a persistent concern for RBC. Also, softness in the semiconductor equipment market due to a slowdown in the overall manufacturing sector might impede the company’s growth in the near term.

RBC Bearings is currently dealing with the rising cost of sales. Increasing raw material costs are pushing up the cost of sales. In the first six months of fiscal 2026, the company’s cost of sales and SG&A expenses increased 11% and 10.4%, respectively. High costs and expenses, if uncontrolled, may adversely impact the company’s margins and profitability in the quarters ahead.

Top 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026

The U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing’s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.

The tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.

Trade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.

Key Growth Drivers for 2026

Rapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.

AI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.

China is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government’s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.

Amid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.

After years of policies that constrained investment and delayed infrastructure, the industry delivered measurable results in 2025. LNG export approvals resumed, long-overdue permitting reform advanced, and production records continued to fall, strengthening national security, supporting the economy, and keeping energy affordable for American households. Federal forecasts show U.S. LNG exports climbing to an average of 14.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2025, up from a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

These outcomes marked a clear shift from the prior policy approach, which prioritized restrictions over reliability and slowed critical energy infrastructure development. In 2025, the Trump administration’s renewed focus on energy dominance and infrastructure realigned federal priorities with market demand, restoring momentum across the energy sector and unlocking new opportunities for growth.

Here’s a look at the highlights from 2025:

Permitting Reform Gains Momentum

Permitting reform gained strong support in 2025 as lawmakers, industry leaders, and business groups pushed to modernize outdated approval processes that delay critical infrastructure. Following Congress’s return from the August recess, a diverse coalition urged Congress to streamline reviews, reduce delays, lower costs, and boost energy investment.

The letter, signed by a broad cross-section of business and energy groups, including the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers, stated:

“The time has come to modernize our nation’s permitting systems so that our communities can build the infrastructure necessary to grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”

By modernizing permitting processes and reducing approval delays, critical energy infrastructure can be built faster to meet rising demand and address grid constraints. Streamlined approvals also help lower project costs and support economic growth, enabling more reliable and affordable energy for American households.

The National Petroleum Council (NPC) reinforced this urgency in a new report that underscored that permitting challenges create structural vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy system, contributing to price volatility, supply insecurity, higher costs, and job losses.

Energy Secretary Wright, who commissioned the NPC report, called its findings an important step forward:

“The National Petroleum Council’s findings confirm what President Trump has said from day one: America needs more energy infrastructure, less red tape, and serious permitting reform. These recommendations will help make energy more affordable for every American household.”

Momentum continued to build toward the end of the year. In December, the House advanced the bipartisan SPEED Act, which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act, and passed the PERMIT Act, targeting Clean Water Act reforms designed to reduce permitting backlogs. Together, these measures signal meaningful progress toward faster, more predictable permitting outcomes.

LNG Exports Resume and Break Records

Following the LNG moratorium under the previous administration, the U.S. Department of Energy officially reopened LNG export authorizations in early 2025. The move restored regular order to the LNG approval process, as required under the Natural Gas Act. Record-setting exports followed throughout the year, demonstrating that domestic prices remain stable even as American LNG reaches global markets.

In 2025, the United States set LNG export records for four consecutive months, further demonstrating the resilience of the U.S. energy system. The United States now supplies 55 percent of Europe’s LNG, helping EU countries reduce reliance on Russian gas.

According to the International Gas Union’s Global Gas Report 2025, Asia and other emerging economies drove the bulk of global gas demand growth in 2024, while global LNG demand is projected to rise by another 71 Bcm in 2025. This highlights that U.S. LNG exports are critical not just for Europe but also for meeting fast-growing energy needs in Asia.

With LNG exports poised to double, North American export capacity is projected to grow from 15.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to nearly 30 Bcf/d by 2029, an increase of 13.9 Bcf/d according to EIA estimates. This expansion positions the U.S. to meet European energy security needs while supporting rising demand in Asia, American jobs, and long-term economic growth.

During an interview with Axios, Jarrod Agen, executive director of the White House National Energy Dominance Council, captured the global demand for American energy:

“It’s Europe, it’s Asia. They are looking for U.S. energy. They want to get off of Russian energy sources, and we have such a supply.”

U.S. LNG exports have already provided over 273,000 American jobs and are projected to generate $166 billion in tax revenue through 2040, with additional projects under construction expected to amplify these benefits.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright summarized the global importance of U.S. LNG exports in May 2025:

“The facts are clear: expanding America’s LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world.”

Offshore Production Expands

In 2025, Congress and the administration prioritized expanding offshore energy consistent with the President’s energy dominance agenda. Early in the year, one of the first House Committee on Natural Resources’ oversight hearings highlighted the importance of restoring offshore oil and natural gas development.

Momentum continued in the fall when a federal court reaffirmed presidential authority over offshore leasing, clearing the way for new development. In November, the Interior Department followed with a major offshore leasing expansion, covering waters off California, Florida, and Alaska. These actions align with the Department of the Interior and BOEM’s Five-Year Offshore Leasing Plan (2026–2031), which proposes up to 34 lease sales across the Gulf of America, Alaska, and the Pacific coast. By providing long-term clarity and predictability, the plan encourages investment, supports thousands of jobs, and strengthens U.S. energy security.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum emphasized the importance of these developments:

“Through a transparent and inclusive public engagement process, we are reinforcing our commitment to responsible offshore energy development—driving job creation, bolstering economic growth, and strengthening American energy independence. Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, we are unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for generations to come.”

Offshore energy continues to deliver substantial economic benefits. activity in the Outer Continental Shelf supported 250,000 jobs and $59.5 billion in economic output. In 2025, BOEM held Lease Sale Big Beautiful Gulf 1, generating over $300 million in high bids for 181 blocks. This sale reflects strong industry confidence in U.S. offshore energy and continued growth across the sector.

Future offshore leasing is projected to produce 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day through 2040 , while maintaining stringent environmental standards. Gulf operations continue to emit significantly less per barrel than most other producing regions worldwide.

Alaska Energy Resurgence

Alaska’s energy sector regained momentum in 2025 as coordinated federal and state actions focused on unlocking the state’s vast resource potential. On his first day in office, President Trump signed the executive order Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential, supporting the Alaska LNG project, reopening access to leases in ANWR and NPR-A, and encouraging responsible resource development.

State leaders praised the move as a critical step toward strengthening energy security and affordability. Senator Lisa Murkowski wrote in a statement:

“The policies laid out in this Executive Order will improve our economy, our budget, and our quality of life while simultaneously making energy more affordable and enhancing national security. Alaska is the blue chip in the United States’ energy portfolio, and I thank President Trump for helping us capitalize on our resources.”

EIA forecasts show Alaska crude oil production is expected to grow in 2026 for the first time since 2017, driven by projects such as Nuna and Pikka—marking the largest annual increase since 2002 and signaling renewed long-term production strength.

Source: Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2025

According to the Alaska Oil & Gas Association, the industry supported more than 69,000 jobs and $5.9 billion in wages in 2022, underscoring its importance to Alaska’s economy and national energy supply.

Record Production While Reducing Emissions

Even through increased demand and renewed energy dominance, U.S. producers continued to demonstrate that record production and emissions reductions can advance together. Methane emissions intensity in the Permian Basin dropped by more than 50 percent from 2022 to 2024, even as the basin contributed nearly half of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of natural gas output.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, 2025

This year’s Environmental Partnership report highlighted how nationwide methane emissions declined 40 percent since 2015, even as production increased by more than 50 percent.

Return to Realistic Energy Expectations

Also notable in 2025 is that the International Energy Agency (IEA) returned to its core mission of providing objective, market-based energy analysis. After years of speculative scenarios that assumed peak fossil fuel demand by 2029, the IEA reinstated its Current Policies Scenario, projecting continued growth in oil and natural gas demand through 2050.

As Bloomberg reported:

“The annual report being prepared by the International Energy Agency shows decades more of robust fossil-fuel use, with oil and gas demand growing over the next 25 years — not just possible, but probable.”

The shift is more than academic. Banks, investors, and governments rely on IEA modeling to guide infrastructure and energy security decisions. The return to tried-and-tested demand projections has already produced tangible benefits: renewed investment in oil and gas projects, stabilization of energy markets, and clearer signals to policymakers on infrastructure priorities.

After years of underinvestment that risked future shortages, banks reversed course and renewed commitments to oil and natural gas development. Similarly, from Massachusetts and New York to California and Pennsylvania, policymakers quietly reopened the door to natural gas infrastructure, delayed unrealistic emissions targets, and backed away from climate litigation. Together, these developments signal a return to pragmatic energy expectations and policies grounded in reality.

Looking Ahead to 2026

The momentum built in 2025 sets the stage for continued U.S. energy leadership in 2026. Permitting reform, expanded offshore development, and renewed investment in Alaska will remain central to meeting growing global demand. Europe is actively reducing reliance on Russian energy, while Asian markets are increasing imports of U.S. LNG.

At home, think tanks and policy experts are stressing energy strategies that bolster economic competitiveness and grid reliability while accounting for growing electricity needs from AI, data centers, and electrification. AI and data centers are driving significant electricity demand in North America and Asia, highlighting the need for flexible, reliable natural gas to stabilize grids and integrate renewables efficiently.

U.S. energy remains a critical tool for allies and a foundation of domestic prosperity. 2026 will be a year where energy leadership, pragmatic policy, and technological innovation converge to provide reliable, affordable, and globally impactful energy.

Bottom Line

2025 reinforced that the United States can lead the world in energy production while strengthening the economy, meeting global demand, and reducing emissions. With policy reform, infrastructure investment, and continued innovation, the U.S. oil and natural gas industry enters 2026 positioned to deliver affordable, reliable energy at home and abroad.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EID-EOY-post-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 14:01:12.354967

He still looks as young and drives as fast as his younger teammates within the Ford Multimatic Motorsports stable of Mustang GT3 drivers. He can easily be viewed one of sports car racing’s greatest drivers, ambassadors and gentlemen of the millennium with his affable attitude and incredible insights.

The German driver best known as “Rocky” made his early mark coming up the sports car ladder with two distinct German brands: Porsche and Audi. In 2010, he won both the Rolex 24 At Daytona and 24 Hours of Le Mans overall in the same year; the Rolex aboard an Action Express Racing Riley-Porsche closed cockpit Daytona Prototype and Le Mans in a factory Audi R15 TDI Plus diesel LMP1 open prototype. He’s the second most recent driver to do that, as Fernando Alonso did so in 2019 with a Cadillac DPi-V.R at the Rolex 24 and a Toyota TS050 Hybrid in LMP1 at Le Mans.

But in recent years, “Rocky’s” manufacturer presence has been distinctly American. He raced both GT and Daytona Prototype Corvettes off-and-on through the mid-2010s, and then was the sports car expert who guided Jimmie Johnson, Jenson Button and the Hendrick Motorsports collaborative Garage 56 Chevrolet Camaro ZR1 to take NASCAR back to Le Mans in 2023. He also ran select NASCAR Cup Series races for Johnson’s Legacy Motor Club team when it still ran Chevrolets.

Since 2024, “Rocky” has been a “blue oval” man through and through. He’s been back in a full-time seat in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship as part of Ford’s Grand Touring Daytona Pro (GTD PRO) effort, and through the end of 2025, was the only driver Ford kept in that full-time role for both seasons.

For 2026, things change a bit. After Rockenfeller and Harry Tincknell shared the No. 64 Ford Mustang GT3 in 2024 and Rockenfeller and Seb Priaulx then partnered to be the proverbial veteran and young charger pairing in 2025, both “Rocky” and “Sebby” shift to Michelin Endurance Cup roles in 2026 split between the Nos. 64 and 65 cars.

Rockenfeller seems to feel something different with Ford than he did with the German brands he raced with earlier in his career. As he reflected during the IMSA-sanctioned November test, being part of Ford means going back more than a century and building on it as Ford continues its global motorsports ramp-up to be one of the world’s most pre-eminent motorsport manufacturers.

“Where I’ve come from, I was not surprised… but at Charlotte when they did the season launch two years ago, I’d just joined the program so I only understood it somewhat,” Rockenfeller explained. “But they do NASCAR. Off-road. Baja. Obviously sports car racing. They will do F1. Then Hypercar/GTP… yes, it’s Europe for now, but hopefully they come to the U.S. It’s unreal how big their program is. The Red Bull F1 thing I hope will be very successful, super cool and exciting. The range they go is unreal.”

Ford’s perception is changing globally, too, he noted.

“For me coming from different brands and joining a new one, in Europe, Ford is a different brand than what it is in the U.S.,” Rockenfeller said. “Here, it’s massive. There, the Germans are quite big. That’s normal.

“But I always had friends driving Ford. A friend of mine in go-karts has three Ford dealerships. I always looked at it, but I never imagined I’d race for Ford. To get to know the family and Jim Farley and all of them, (Mark) Rushbrook, it’s such a family. And they’re emotional with racing. They really love it, and you can see it in the programs they do.”

Rockenfeller then proceeded to tell just how much of the Ford family presence the manufacturer wanted to share with its drivers.

“The first year in Detroit, we went to the Henry Ford House, where he basically lived. It’s kind of a museum almost,” he said. “It’s unreal to hear the stories; Edsel and that. It’s unreal. To hopefully write some history together is great. I feel such a part of it. To identify, it takes a bit of time. You need to know the cars, the people, and success and not success together. Year three … this year changed a lot for me. I feel like I’m there now.”

Indeed, the leap Ford made in IMSA from year one in 2024 to year two in 2025 with the Mustang GT3 was paramount. Rockenfeller won the Motul Pole Award for the Rolex 24 and the duo finished third with third driver Austin Cindric, who was deputizing for the injured Ben Barker. The sister No. 65 car won the Rolex with Frederic Vervisch, Christopher Mies and Dennis Olsen.

Ford’s No. 64 car enjoyed major success as the year progressed with two wins on the streets of Detroit – notably cast against the corporate headquarters and backdrop of crosstown rivals General Motors – and then the six-hour TireRack.com Battle On The Bricks in Indianapolis. With one other podium (second at Road America), Rockenfeller and Priaulx finished third in GTD PRO points.

“Every victory is special in its own,” Rockenfeller admitted. “Detroit is the only street circuit (for GTD PRO). It’s cool scenery and it’s different. I love to race in cities anyway but that’s the only chance on the calendar to do so. We don’t do Long Beach. Then obviously that’s the home race for Ford Motor Company and GM is there. It’s a big battle between us. To come out on top was the highlight.

“Indy was so cool; we were second the year before. We knew it was a strong place for us. To win with ‘Sebby’ was good as we just started working together this year and it turned out to be a pretty good combo.

“Then at Indy, it was special to have the whole family (as part of new IMSA Resilient Racers program) there enjoying it, taking the pictures, being on the podium. Especially as a father of three, you understand what matters in life. You think racing is the most important or when you’re doing it. But there’s a lot more in life, to share emotions and give something back. That’s very special.”

For 2026, Rockenfeller will share the No. 64 car with Olsen and Barker, who are set to embark on the full-season effort. That means Rockenfeller’s IMSA goal for 2026 is trophy hunting at the three longest Michelin Endurance Cup rounds, and notably, adding another Rolex watch to his 2010 one. Missing out in 2025 stung, he admitted.

“In the end, to win you need to be perfect,” he said. “The other car had a better setup and we didn’t. The last two tenths, probably. They deserved it! I’m happy they did. Obviously, I’m a Ford driver, so it’s good for all of us if the car wins.

“In the end we had a strong season. I’m sure the big goal is to win the championship. If you ask me what do you prefer, I don’t know if I would pick between 24 and the championship. Probably the championship. It gives a better picture of the whole year.

“But at Daytona, I’d like to get a free watch and not have to buy one!”",http://www.imsa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2025/12/22/IMSA_Rocky26_123025_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 13:00:46.640649

The fund seeks capital appreciation.

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the fund. You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and examples below. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the fund or shares of other funds in the BNY Mellon Family of Funds that are subject to a sales charge. More information about sales charges, including these and other discounts and waivers, is available from your financial professional and in the Shareholder Guide section beginning on page 9 of the prospectus, in the Appendix on page A-1 of the prospectus and in the How to Buy Shares section and the Additional Information About How to Buy Shares section beginning on page II-1 and page III-1, respectively, of the fund's Statement of Additional Information.

* Class A shares bought without an initial sales charge as part of an investment of $1 million or more may be charged a deferred sales charge of 1.00% if redeemed within one year.

+ The fund's investment adviser, BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc., has contractually agreed, until December 31, 2026, to waive receipt of its fees and/or assume the direct expenses of the fund so that the direct expenses of none of the fund's share classes (excluding Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder services fees, taxes, interest expense, brokerage commissions, commitment fees on borrowings and extraordinary expenses) exceed .68%.

Example

The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund's operating expenses remain the same. The one-year example and the first year of the three-, five- and ten-years examples are based on net operating expenses, which reflect the expense limitation agreement by BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover

The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 95.20% of the average value of its portfolio.

To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in stocks. The fund may invest up to 30% of its net assets in foreign securities. Newton Investment Management North America, LLC, the fund's sub-adviser, identifies potential investments through extensive quantitative and fundamental research. The fund focuses on individual stock selection (a ""bottom-up"" approach), emphasizing three key factors: value, sound business fundamentals and positive business momentum.

The fund typically sells a stock when the fund's sub-adviser believes there is a more attractive alternative, the stock's valuation is excessive or there are deteriorating fundamentals, such as a loss of competitive advantage, a failure in management execution or deteriorating capital structure. In addition, at times, the fund may engage in active and frequent trading, which will increase portfolio turnover.

An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit. It is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. It is not a complete investment program. The fund's share price fluctuates, sometimes dramatically, which means you could lose money.

·Risks of stock investing: Stocks generally fluctuate more in value than bonds and may decline significantly over short time periods. There is the chance that stock prices overall will decline because stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and falling prices. The market value of a stock may decline due to general market conditions or because of factors that affect the particular company or the company's industry.

·Value stock risk: Value stocks involve the risk that they may never reach their expected full market value, either because the market fails to recognize the stock's intrinsic worth or the expected value was misgauged.

·Market risk: The value of the securities in which the fund invests may be affected by political, regulatory, economic and social developments, and developments that impact specific economic sectors, industries or segments of the market. In addition, turbulence in financial markets and reduced liquidity in equity, credit and/or fixed-income markets may negatively affect many issuers, which could adversely affect the fund. Global economies and financial markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, and conditions and events in one country, region or financial market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region or financial market. These risks may be magnified if certain events or developments adversely interrupt the global supply chain; in these and other circumstances, such risks might affect companies world-wide. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, elevated levels of government debt, changes in trade regulation or economic sanctions, internal unrest and discord, or other events could have a significant impact on the fund and its investments.

·Foreign investment risk: To the extent the fund invests in foreign securities, the fund's performance will be influenced by political, social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign issuers. Special risks associated with investments in foreign issuers include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive and less publicly available company information, political and economic instability and differing auditing, accounting and legal standards.

·Portfolio turnover risk: The fund may engage in short-term trading, which could produce higher transaction costs and taxable distributions, and lower the fund's after-tax performance.

·Management risk: The investment process used by the fund's sub-adviser could fail to achieve the fund's investment goal and cause your fund investment to lose value.

The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the performance of the fund's Class A shares from year to year. Sales charges, if any, are not reflected in the bar chart, and, if those charges were included, returns would have been less than those shown. The table compares the average annual total returns of the fund's shares to those of the Russell 1000® Index, a broad measure of relevant market performance, and the Russell 1000® Value Index, an index reflecting the market segments in which the fund invests. The fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. Performance for each share class will vary due to differences in expenses. More recent performance information may be available at www.bny.com/investments.

The year-to-date total return of the fund's Class A shares as of September 30, 2025 was 12.75%.

After-tax performance is shown only for Class A shares. After-tax performance of the fund's other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their shares through U.S. tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

The fund's investment adviser is BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc. (BNYIA). BNYIA has engaged its affiliate, Newton Investment Management North America, LLC (NIMNA), to serve as the fund's sub-adviser.

Brian C. Ferguson, John C. Bailer, CFA and Keith Howell are the fund's primary portfolio managers. Mr. Ferguson has been the fund's lead portfolio manager since September 2003 and is a portfolio manager at NIMNA. Mr. Bailer has been a primary portfolio manager of the fund since December 2004 and is Deputy Head of Equity Income and a portfolio manager at NIMNA. Mr. Howell has been a primary portfolio manager of the fund since September 2021 and is a portfolio manager at NIMNA.

This potential conflict of interest may be addressed by policies, procedures or practices adopted by the financial intermediary. As there may be many different policies, procedures or practices adopted by different intermediaries to address the manner in which compensation is earned through the sale of investments or the provision of related services, the compensation rates and other payment arrangements that may apply to a financial intermediary and its representatives may vary by intermediary. Ask your financial representative or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.

The Japanese investment giant sent over a final $22 billion to $22.5 billion last week, according to the sources familiar with the matter. SoftBank had previously syndicated $10 billion and invested $8 billion in the ChatGPT maker.

The investment takes SoftBank's stake in the company above 10%.

CNBC reported in February that the company was finalizing a $40 billion investment in the Sam Altman-run startup at a $260 billion pre-money valuation.

At the time, sources told Faber that the funding would be paid out over a 12 to 24 month period. Some money was slated to support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure Stargate joint venture with Oracle and SoftBank.

Companies have been spending big in recent months to build out infrastructure to support a frenzy for AI solutions and growing compute needs.

Over the years, SoftBank has been betting big on technology and AI companies and was an early investor in chipmaking giant Nvidia. On Monday, the conglomerate agreed to pay $4 billion for data center investment firm DigitalBridge to strengthen its AI push.

Last month, the SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in major AI beneficiary and chipmaker Nvidia . A source familiar with the matter told CNBC that the sale, combined with other cash sources, would support its OpenAI investment.

Published December 30, 2025

Lewes, Delaware RMIQ, an AI-powered cross-retail media network platform, today announced the expansion of its platform with the integration of several large-scale retail media networks across grocery, general merchandise, and specialty retail categories. This strategic expansion strengthens RMIQ's position as a comprehensive solution for brands and marketers looking to manage and optimize advertising spend across multiple retail environments.

The newly added networks enhance RMIQ's growing ecosystem, which already includes top retail media networks from a dozen regional retail media platforms. With these additions, advertisers can now execute and manage campaigns across an even broader range of grocery, general merchandise, and specialty retail channels through a single, unified platform.

Retail media continues to experience rapid growth as brands seek direct access to consumers closer to the point of purchase. However, managing campaigns across multiple retail media networks often leads to data fragmentation, operational complexity, and inefficient budget allocation. RMIQ addresses these challenges by offering a centralized, AI-powered platform designed to streamline cross-network campaign management and improve return on ad spend.

""The expansion of our retail media integrations represents a significant milestone in our mission to simplify cross-network advertising management,"" said Matt Drela, CEO of RMIQ. ""Brands can now reach consumers across multiple retail categories while maintaining consistent oversight, transparency, and optimization of their advertising investments.""

With access to advertising inventory across diverse retail segments--including grocery delivery, general merchandise, and specialty retail--brands can develop cohesive retail media strategies aligned with multiple shopping occasions and consumer touchpoints.

RMIQ's artificial intelligence technology continuously analyzes performance data across integrated networks, identifying optimization opportunities and delivering actionable insights. This approach helps marketers reduce wasted spend, allocate budgets more effectively, and improve overall campaign efficiency, while minimizing the operational burden of managing multiple retail media relationships.

As the retail media ecosystem continues to evolve, RMIQ remains focused on helping brands navigate complexity and unlock greater value from their advertising investments through integrated technology and cross-network intelligence.

The S&P Global Russia Services PMI Business Activity Index edged up to 52.3 in December from 52.2 in November. Readings above 50 denote growing activity, while ‌below 50 indicates contraction.

The slight rise ‌in December was attributed to stronger customer demand and a solid increase in new business, which grew at its fastest rate since May.

Despite this growth, service providers reduced ​staffing levels for the first time in six months, and at the fastest rate in nearly ‍three years. The reduction ​was primarily due to a decrease in ​full-time workers, as business confidence waned.

Pressure on capacity was ‍evident, with backlogs of work accumulating at the fastest pace in a year, while firms reported higher new order inflows.

Operating expenses rose at the slowest rate since May 2009, with firms noting higher ‍transportation and supplier costs but reduced wage bills. Firms sought to pass on their higher costs by raising their ‍selling prices, ‍albeit at a slower pace than ​in previous months.

Business confidence dipped, with ​optimism at ⁠its second-lowest level since January 2023, ‌although firms remained hopeful for stronger demand conditions and new service lines.

The composite PMI, which includes manufacturing, stagnated at 50.0, as a decline in manufacturing offset the growth in service sector business.

Our latest independent report examines recent figures and market trends.","While much of the technology investment community remains focused on Nvidia's multi-billion dollar acquisition of Groq, a notable divergence is occurring with Adobe. Recent regulatory filings reveal that several prominent institutional asset managers have significantly pared back their stakes in the software giant. This selling pressure coincides with Adobe's shares trading approximately 24% below their peak for the year.

A Closer Look at the Filings

The latest round of 13F filings, made public this Tuesday, shows a coordinated reduction in Adobe exposure among key investors. The moves present a clear pattern of divestment.

Perigon Wealth Management cut its Adobe holding by 33%, disposing of 3,589 shares.

Boston Trust Walden Corp sold over 12,000 shares, reducing its position by nearly 14%.

Ethic Inc. also retreated, decreasing its stake by 12.7%.

This institutional pullback appears strategically timed. It aligns with a significant sector rotation within technology, triggered by Nvidia's $20 billion deal for AI chipmaker Groq on December 24, 2025. That blockbuster transaction has redirected investor attention squarely toward the hardware layer, where semiconductors and data centers are perceived to offer a faster path to monetization compared to software applications.

Strong Fundamentals Contrast with Market Sentiment

The wave of selling stands in paradox to Adobe's solid operational performance. The company's quarterly results for its fourth fiscal year, reported on December 10, exceeded market expectations.

Revenue reached $6.19 billion, marking a 10.5% year-over-year increase and surpassing the consensus estimate of $6.11 billion.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $5.50, beating the forecast of $5.40.

The non-GAAP operating margin was a robust 45.6%.

Adobe continues to successfully integrate generative AI across its product suite through its Firefly models. However, the current market environment demands tangible proof of how AI features translate into incremental revenue, forcing software companies into a ""show-me"" phase that is testing investor patience.

Analyst Consensus Stays Bullish

Despite the stock's weakness and institutional selling, Wall Street's outlook remains decidedly positive. Data from TipRanks shows a clear ""Strong Buy"" consensus, comprising 19 buy recommendations, four hold ratings, and a single sell suggestion. The average price target among analysts sits at $460, implying an upside potential of roughly 30% from current levels.

For the 2026 fiscal year, Adobe's management has provided revenue guidance in the range of $25.9 billion to $26.1 billion. From a technical analysis perspective, the stock is currently hovering around a key support level near $350. A sustained move above the $400 threshold would be needed to signal a meaningful improvement in its chart pattern. Until the next quarterly report in March, the share price is likely to remain vulnerable to ongoing sector rotations.
