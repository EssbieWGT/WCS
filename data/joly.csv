The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is one of the one of the stocks Jim Cramer was bullish on due to share buyback activity. Cramer said, “we think the world of” the company’s CEO, as he commented:

“Fourth is a bank that I’ve come to like very much over the past couple years, and that’s BNY, the old Bank of New York Mellon. BNY shrunk its share count by 36.2% since the end of 2015, even if the stock wasn’t a real outperformer until more recently. Under CEO Robin Vince, we think the world of him, a Goldman Sachs alum who’s been leading BNY for the past three years or so. The nation’s oldest bank has found new life. They focus on selling their entire suite of financial services to investors rather than marketing this stuff as one-off products. And they’ve also leaned heavily into technology, including AI, maybe the most of all the banks I follow. It’s truly working as the stock’s nearly tripled in a little more than two years.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) provides financial services, including investment management, custody, clearing, and wealth planning. The company also offers banking, trading, and cash management solutions. Cramer mentioned the company during the July 15 episode and remarked:

“This morning, everybody was focused on the numbers from the big banks, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, but they were also watching the report from BNY, and that’s the old Bank of New York Mellon. This is one of the top custodial banks in America. And this morning, BNY reported another strong quarter with easy top and bottom line beats, not to mention a stunning nearly 28% return on something called tangible common equity. That’s one of the best results I’ve ever seen from a bank. BNY even raised its full-year net interest income forecast with the quarter. Very few did that.”

ID32,Nvidia,2025-12-21 15:02:12+00:00,The Motley Fool,1 Big Reason Why Today's Value Investors Won't Find Tomorrow's Nvidia | The Motley Fool,"Jon Quast, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/20/1-big-reason-why-todays-value-investors-wont-find/,"But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way.
Why value investors missed Nvidia Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks.
Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.
Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019.
The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability.","In his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, said, ""We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant."" In other words, seeking value is the only way to invest. Given Buffett's affinity for value investing and his incredible success over the years, many investors seek to emulate his approach to stocks.

Unfortunately, most value investors miss the forest for the trees. And I'll explain how by using Nvidia (NVDA +3.80%) -- the best-performing large-cap stock of the past decade -- as an example.

Yes, I know it's a cherry-picked example. But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way. It's important to recognize the misconception that holds investors back from life-changing opportunities.

Why value investors missed Nvidia

Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks. And cheapness is measured by comparing the value of the company with something from its financial results, including profits.

Let's say a company is valued at $50 billion and only has $50 million in net income. This stock would be valued at 1,000 times its earnings. In other words, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (a popular valuation metric) would be 1,000. Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.

In 2019, Nvidia's market cap, the value of the company, was around $100 billion. But its average P/E ratio for the year was 35, as the chart below shows.

The average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is somewhere around 25. Anything above that has an above-average valuation and is considered expensive by value investors. Nvidia in 2019, therefore, would have been too pricey to buy.

Value investors believe that the best value stocks to buy trade at a P/E ratio below the average. And often, value investors think that the cheaper a stock is, the better.

However, Nvidia has gone on to outperform virtually every other publicly traded company since the start of 2020, despite having an above-average P/E ratio. In short, value investing, as traditionally approached, prevented some investors from buying one of the greatest stocks of our time.

How to improve the value mindset

There's another important quote from Buffett that needs to be considered here. In the same letter, he wrote, ""Growth is always a component in the calculation of value."" In other words, value investors must look ahead when looking for a bargain.

Herein lies the problem with value investing as it's usually done: The P/E ratio (and others) measures past results. But investors must buy stocks today, looking ahead to what the business results could be tomorrow.

Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019. But the P/E ratio didn't reflect the company's superb future earnings growth. As the chart below shows, the stock price is up nearly 3,000% in the last five years, but its earnings per share (EPS) are up even more than that.

Nvidia has earned $100 billion in net income over the past year. The stock traded at 35 times trailing earnings in 2019, which looked expensive. But for those with foresight, the entire value of the company then was equal to its profits right now, which is about as cheap as a stock could possibly be.

On a personal note, I missed Nvidia stock in 2019, not because of its pricey P/E ratio, but rather because I didn't foresee earnings growth of this magnitude. I didn't believe that the current build-out for AI infrastructure would be so big and last for so long. And in a traditionally cyclical space, I worried that overestimating demand would lead to lower margins at Nvidia.

I was dead wrong, and that underscores why investing is hard. Looking at a P/E ratio or a market cap is easy. Predicting where the world is going, how a company is positioned, and what that means financially is a tall order. It's why even the best investors often make mistakes.

The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability. The best stocks for the next 10 years might not look like value stocks right now. But they will be a tremendous value in hindsight.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847355%2Fyoung-man-sitting-pensively-at-his-computer-looking-thoughtfully-at-the-screen-in-front-of-him.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-21 11:01:15.684515

“These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.” In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics.
“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said.
“Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace.
“Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.","Electric two-wheelers will continue to anchor electric vehicle (EV) adoption in India, while passenger cars are set to emerge as the fastest-growing segment from 2026, according to a recent assessment by Capgemini. The consulting firm said strong total cost of ownership benefits, improving charging access and rapid digitisation of vehicles will drive the next phase of EV growth across regions and city tiers.

“Globally, passenger cars will still dominate EV volumes, but in markets like India the deepest penetration will come from two- and three-wheelers and last-mile commercial vehicles,” said Anuraag Bharadwaj, Industry Platform Leader for Automotive – India at Capgemini. “These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.”

In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics. At the same time, passenger EVs are expected to see sharp year-on-year growth as charging infrastructure expands and product options widen across cities.

Beyond the Sale

Technology is also reshaping the two-wheeler segment. Digital display clusters are increasingly mirroring car infotainment systems, offering connected features such as navigation, diagnostics and content playback. Alongside this, software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are beginning to alter OEM business models in India. “OEMs are clearly looking beyond one-time vehicle sales,” Bharadwaj said. “Subscriptions, connected services and feature-led monetisation will become increasingly important revenue streams as consumers become more value-conscious.”

Profitability Gap

However, even as adoption accelerates, Capgemini cautioned that EV profitability in India remains constrained by weak battery localisation. Batteries account for nearly 40% of an EV’s total cost, making them the most expensive component. While localisation has improved in vehicle assembly and electronics integration, domestic battery cell manufacturing remains limited, forcing automakers to rely on imports from China and other markets.

“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said. “Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace. Without a strong domestic ecosystem for cell manufacturing and raw material processing, EV profitability in India will remain structurally constrained.” In the interim, mainstream automakers such as Mahindra are sourcing advanced battery technologies like Blade cells from BYD, a configuration expected in upcoming models including the Maruti eVitara and the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV.

Government incentives under the Production Linked Incentive scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell batteries have triggered gigafactory announcements, but Capgemini said their impact on vehicle costs will be felt only over the medium term. “Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/capgemini.reuters_20250918174936_20251218154439_20251221142311.jpg?quality=100,N,,2025-12-21 11:00:59.375773

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements.
Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing.
A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?
3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls.","Remember when desktop 3D printing felt like the Wild West? A decade ago, anyone with a printer, some filament, and a free weekend could grab models from Thingiverse, tweak a few slicer settings, and let the machine run overnight. The process—and the prints that resulted from it—were chaotic, messy, and often frustrating, but it was also…fun? It felt like the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine, and it was, arguably, glorious.

That free-for-all experimentation era is fading fast, though. In its place? Carefully curated, tightly controlled “walled gardens” where companies make not only the hardware but also the software, the consumables, and the very marketplace where files are shared. It’s the iOS ecosystem, but for 3D printers. And the kicker? While there are protests from the edges, for the most part, it actually works, and people are growing to love it.

Keep Them Coming Back for More

When I was a young engineer starting out, I worked for an automated machinery company that serviced the sewing goods industry. Sewing machines have hundreds of moving parts, and they wear out over time. My employer took me aside once and showed me one of those parts in a spare bin. He rolled it in his hand like a poker chip. The tone in his voice grew somber as he said to me, “See this plate? This costs us $15 to import. We sell it for $400. It wears out, on average, every 4 to 6 months. Always remember: Whenever possible, sell the stapler and the staples.”

He explained to me that for the business to continue running—and to grow and keep everyone employed—the initial purchase of the machinery couldn’t be a customer's only purchase. Parts and supplies like these, with incredibly high markups, were what kept the lights on. A customer who bought a machine from us could spend upward of five to 10 times more than the cost of the machine itself over its lifespan.

Fast-forward to now. I'm no longer hawking sewing machine parts. Instead, I'm writing this story in my home office, where I tinker with and test all sorts of gadgets, including 3D printers. The office is filled with not just printers, but also filament, resin, and spare parts: ""staples,"" from floor to ceiling. Plenty of other hobbyists' and entrepreneurs' home offices look just like mine, which makes you quickly realize the oodles of cash that are up for grabs selling 3D printing accessories.

So it's only natural that the walled gardens of 3D printing are growing taller, as the big players have emerged and dug in. Depending on where you stand, that’s either a long-overdue correction or the beginning of a slow suffocation. A feature, or a fetter.

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing

The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements. If you want to print, you’re encouraged—and sometimes forced—to use only what the company that made your printer sells. This is happening in two universes at the moment: The consumer side, which is what we mostly cover at PCMag, and the professional side, where many American and European companies have found respite from Chinese competitors for the time being.

Compare that to the “open” 3D printing world that I, along with many other pioneering hobbyists, grew up in, and which still exists but is fading rapidly. In that world, you can download models from a dozen free sites, slice them in Cura or PrusaSlicer, and run whatever filament happens to be on sale this week. Need a new gasket for a DIY repair, perhaps? Don't order it from Amazon or even McMaster-Carr. Just print your own on an open-source printer. It’s cheaper, but it’s also messier and more time-consuming.

This phenomenon isn't novel, of course. Printer—paper printer—manufacturers have been pulling this trick for decades by making proprietary ink cartridges. A decade ago, HP tried to block the use of third-party ink via firmware, making you fear bricking your own printer if you tried to use another vendor’s ink. (HP later abandoned this effort, at least in part.) Apple’s App Store lives on the same principle. I can’t share songs I purchase on my Android phone with my wife, who is browsing the iTunes store next to me as I write this.

The difference, though, is that in 3D printing, the stakes involve not just money but reliability, safety, and speed—things that can make or break a newbie’s first impression.

Why Companies Are Raising the Walls

If you’re wondering why companies are doubling down on lock-ins and gathering as many customers as they can into their respective gardens, the answer is simple: control.

Support Costs Drop When You Control Every Variable

Think about it from the company's perspective: Fewer random filaments means fewer angry customers sending failed print photos to your support team—the “Why is this piece of junk not working?” tickets. It also means fewer nozzles you have to ship out, at your cost, to keep their flaming fingers out of the forums and Facebook groups long enough to get them past the jam they caused with bargain-basement filament.

Safety Improves When Resins and Filaments Are Vetted

Fewer toxic fumes mean fewer mechanical misfires. Formlabs, maker of the Form 4 I recently reviewed, claims to have eliminated the dangerous VOCs found in many resins and uses ISO certification in its resins and other ancillary products to maintain consistency. The Form 4 is therefore a favorite of pros who know exactly why things like tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation, and heat deflection are critical.

Performance Is More Consistent

Tuned profiles mean smoother prints and fewer headaches. When I was coming up in the hobby, it was assumed that you were always tweaking and adjusting; printing calibration cubes, Benchies, and temperature towers. If you didn’t know how to do those things, you were a newbie to be pitied, and most of your prints probably failed.

Those days are long gone. I recently tested the Bambu Lab H2S, which not only comes with pre-tuned slicer settings for every Bambu Lab filament but also includes equivalent settings for nearly every major filament supplier. I tested both, with flawless results and no tuning or futzing required.

Recurring Revenue From Accessories Keeps the Lights On

Printers are often sold at razor-thin margins; filament and resin make up the difference. Here's some napkin math: Assuming we’re talking about a larger brand, the gross margin on filament sales is somewhere between 40% and 70%. The net margin on 3D printers, on the other hand (after all costs and overhead), is maybe 20% or 25%. When you buy a $1,500 printer, the company makes $300 in profits. Assuming you use 50 spools of filament a year per printer, that’s another $500 per year for the life of the machine. Keeping you in the garden is good for business.

Data Loops Build Better Machines

Telemetry on what succeeds and fails feeds back into better slicers, better defaults, and tighter ecosystems. Web-connected slicers like Bambu Studio bring files offsite to a cloud server and back again, which has me concerned about possible IP theft, but let's face it: If Bambu Lab knows all about the file you were printing in a machine that can measure (via cameras and sensors) how the print went, it can learn from failed prints. Tesla monitors all the data from cars using its Full Self-Driving feature to improve the AI that makes driving decisions, and 3D printer companies can take a similar approach. Instead of telemetry data and speeds, it’s g-code and video. No one I’ve ever met who owns a Tesla is mad that their driving data goes back to the corporation, because they know it’s improving their experience. Data loops within the walled garden perform the same function.

If you were raised like me, printing your 3D bits from USB keys instead of via a web app, this can be a hard leap to make. But let's not forget that life outside the garden isn't free from data-sharing pitfalls, either. In 2021, a Thingiverse data breach potentially exposed data from hundreds of thousands of users.

The Upside for Users

Let’s be honest: most people don’t want to fiddle with firmware, PID tuning, or slicer voodoo. They want the print to work the first time. Walled gardens are delivering that in spades. People are loyal to their brands as a result, with the term “fanboy” tossed around more frequently than ever. If you are a Prusa, Bambu Lab, or Creality convert, you know that the energy in those forums is akin to football fans arguing over which team is going to win the Super Bowl this year. And fandom has its concrete benefits.

First-Print Success Rates Skyrocket

A beginner can unbox, click Print, and hold a finished part hours later. I’ve met people who’ve never had a first-layer issue, while back in the day, I would spend hours fighting with my Creality Ender 3, invoking all sorts of remedies, including hairspray, glue sticks, and prayers to whatever deity was listening, to get to the second layer.

Time Savings Are Real

No more spending 3 hours browsing a forum thread to fix a stringing issue: The maker world moves faster than it ever has. I met three vendors at a maker festival in September who cumulatively had about 500 articulated figurines for sale: $5 for three. These people earn their living from these fairs and don’t have time to spare fixing things.

Quality Is Better

Tuned profiles and real-time monitoring reduce the likelihood of failure. I recently had a client come to me asking to reverse-engineer the transparent dome light on his cooking range. The manufacturer didn’t make replacement parts, and so I scanned it and printed it with the Form 4 using Formlabs' Transparent V3 resin, which I know to be dimensionally accurate. The part measured 2.95 inches wide (75.05mm, to be exact), and it was a perfect fit.

I happily pay more for the resin, knowing I can take on those types of jobs and produce an engineered replacement that measures up to what I designed in my CAD software. There's no Wild West aspect, so the experience isn't a nail-biter, but I get great prints with pre-tuned dimensional accuracy.

Safety

Certified materials and built-in interlocks aren’t just marketing; they prevent accidents. When I load the 10-watt laser module into the Bambu Lab H2S and go to cut a part from 3mm-thick birchboard, there’s a QR code sticker in the corner that tells the cutter exactly what material I’m using. It knows what power levels to use and how fast to move the laser through the wood—all the things it needs to avoid setting the board on fire and burning my house down. I trust that over my late-night intuition just before I go to bed, with best guesses driving my g-code. I’ll pay more for that, as will most people, especially when I first start working with new materials I’m unfamiliar with.

The Downsides

Of course, just like an actual wall, the walled-garden approach has multiple sides, and there are plenty of negative ones.

Costs Creep Upward

Proprietary filaments and resins cost more, and some companies use DRM chips to prevent you from using third-party resin. It can get even more extreme than that: The Form 4 and other Formlabs printers prevent owners from using whatever resin they want in their machines unless they pay hefty unlocking fees.

Innovation Slows

When companies dictate what’s allowed, experimental materials and techniques get buried. Once a company can build a large enough user base, it controls the pace of development, as opposed to the early days when innovation leaps were required to punch through into the market.

It takes a ""black swan"" innovator to force everyone with a walled garden to catch up quickly. I believe we’re seeing this now with Snapmaker’s U1 multi-toolhead printer, which has raised more than $20.6 million on Kickstarter at this writing. Bambu Lab is now attempting to compete with its upcoming Vortek tool-changing accessory.

Marketplaces Gatekeep

File visibility isn’t always merit-based; it’s algorithmic. That means the best designs don’t always win—the best thumbnails do. When you control the keys to the kingdom, you control what files people are potentially printing on your machines.

Data Is Extracted

Every print you slice in the cloud reveals information about you, your projects, and your habits to the vendor. Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing. The larger the garden and the more dependent users are on it compounds the possibility of theft or hacking. There’s a tremendous element of trust involved.

Longevity Questions Loom

What happens if the company shuts down its servers or moves on from your model of printer? Suddenly, your “ecosystem” is a paperweight. This has plenty of precedent, too: Google recently discontinued the smart features of older Nest thermostats.

The only company currently providing a robust path forward for upgrades is Prusa, which is arguably being left behind in terms of features as a result. While you can turn a Prusa MK3 or MK4 into a Core One, the Core One simply doesn’t compare to an H2D or H2S, Bambu Lab’s latest models.

A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing

Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?

Prusa printers are arguably the most un-walled mainstream printers out there. The company's Printables is free and open-source, though it lacks the same monetized incentive structure of Bambu Lab's MakerWorld.

Formlabs is mostly closed. Its resin and software ecosystem is locked tight, but its users largely accept it because the quality is unmatched, with dimensionally tuned and accurate outputs. Want your parts to fit together properly? You need Formlabs resin.

Stratasys has always been closed. For enterprise buyers, that’s the point: certifications, compliance, security, and contracts matter more than tinkering. Like Formlabs, Stratasys—and subsidiaries like Ultimaker—have largely retreated to the educational and professional space, with a dwindling number of consumer models available.

Elegoo, Anycubic, Qidi, and Creality occupy a fuzzier space. They've largely been open, but are moving toward curated slicers and marketplaces. Everyone sees where the market is headed, and no one wants to be left behind. Each of these companies has its own filament and resin lines, with virtually every possible color and polymer available, and “pre-tuned” slicer settings in Cura or Orca to get you started quickly without fiddling.

So, should you buy into one of these gardens? It depends on what you want.

If you prioritize reliability, enter the garden. You’ll spend more, but you’ll save time and frustration. If someone were to ask me what a good first 3D printer to buy is, and I wanted them to have the easiest setup and most enjoyable experience, I would drop them off from a theoretical helicopter directly into the middle of Bambu Lab’s garden.

If you love tinkering, stay outside. Cheap filament, third-party slicers, wild mods—the Wild West is disappearing, but it's not gone. If I were on a spaceship that needed to survive a 100-year mission, I would bring a Prusa with me, along with 10,000 rolls of Prusament. Blessed are the tinkerers, and they all wear black-and-orange shirts.

If you have the space and budget for two printers, buy one of each. Use the polished ecosystem for mission-critical prints, and reserve the tinkerer’s machine for experiments with unconventional filaments and techniques. My LulzBot TAZ 5 has been printing for 10 years now. I can put any filament I want into it (I create a makeshift heated chamber by throwing an emergency blanket over it) and keep the earliest phases of my IP private in my office. Just keep your eyes open for red flags: consumables with DRM, printers that function only via cloud slicing, or companies with a history of abandoning products.

What Will the Walled Garden of the Future Bring?

I’d bet on more walls, not fewer. Expect:

Creator subscriptions and “pro” packs. This seems inevitable to me. Platforms like MakerWorld will become more like Spotify, and designers will rise as a result.

Smarter, telemetry-driven auto-profiles. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, it’s hard to envision a world where it isn’t embedded in a machine's ROM to monitor prints via sensors and cameras.

Partially walled gardens, in which vendors still allow escape hatches but prefer you don’t use them. Bambu Lab and Formlabs provide exit hatches for third-party filaments and resins, and I suppose see the necessity of a door in and out of the garden.

Lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. If it’s illegal for HP to stop people from loading third-party ink cartridges, as some customers have (so far unsuccessfully) argued in court, it’s inevitable that regulation will catch up to what is arguably an analogous situation with 3D printers.

(Credit: Michael Lydick)

The genie’s out of the bottle. 3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls. The walled gardens of 3D printing aren’t inherently evil. In many cases, they make the tech more reliable, safer, and far more approachable for the average hobbyist. Without them, adoption would stall.

But make no mistake: Every convenience comes at a cost. If you step into a garden, know the price of admission, and know that the gate may not always stay open. The best gardens don’t just protect the company—they protect the users and the creators, too.

If vendors get that balance right, maybe a wall doesn’t have to feel like a prison. Maybe it can feel like an amusement park—curated, safe, and pleasant, but just exciting enough to be worth wandering into.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05w23Zdc93miv2kx7tU2mqh-7.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1766003609.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 08:59:52.091490

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.","Stalling growth, sticky inflation and fragile bond markets, the UK’s economic record in 2025 has hardly been one to inspire cheer. But in the spirit of the festive season, here are a few reasons to hope for a happier new year.

The first is that, barring external forces, 2026 should not involve a repeat of this year’s fiscal drama.

Rachel Reeves more than doubled the margin of error, or headroom, against her fiscal rules at last month’s budget, and that should gift the Treasury a quieter 2026.

The chancellor’s spring statement should be a non-event for another reason, too: she announced that while the Office for Budget Responsibility will still carry out a forecast, it will not formally assess her against the rules.

So as some wise men – and women – advised her to do last year, even if there has been a marked deterioration in the outlook, Reeves intends to stand firm until the autumn budget. That would mark a welcome contrast with the tax and spend saga of the past year (though if Labour MPs choose to change the top team in Downing Street, the drama would be very much back on).

A second reason for optimism is that after a gloomy year, recent surveys have included glimmers of hope.

Official figures show Britain’s economy unexpectedly shrank in October. But the snapshot is backward-looking, assessing how activity had fared through the rear-view mirror. The latest flash purchasing managers index for December, published by data provider S&P Global, suggests things could be improving. The reading on its monthly index jumped to 52.1, from 51.2 in November – with 50 marking the divide between growth and contraction.

In the private sector, S&P said, “the rise in new business was the strongest for 14 months and mainly reflected a solid improvement in demand across the service economy”.

It would make sense that if, as many business groups have claimed, the chaotic budget buildup killed confidence, we should get a modest uptick in activity now that it is over.

Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says that chimes with what he is hearing from member companies.

“There was a general sense that things got quite a lot better from the first week of September, and October, then the brakes went on a little bit in November, because of pre-budget chat.”

He adds: “[Hiring] won’t come back this month because it’s December, but quite a few people are quite hopeful about what comes through in January and February.”

A third source of optimism is the hope that consumers could respond positively to the latest Bank of England rate cut, the government’s £150-a-year energy bills relief package, and an end to months of tedious speculation over tax.

There are plenty of reasons for caution here. Not least a reluctance at the Bank to cut rates much further, despite weakness in the labour market.

But if cheaper mortgages and energy bills do help to ease the squeeze, and – whisper it – restore a bit of feelgood factor, the evidence suggests some consumers could have some financial capacity to respond.

The household savings rate – the share of income workers put away for a rainy day – has jumped to well above the long-run average since the Covid pandemic. In the second quarter of this year, it was running at 10.7% – about 2.5 percentage points higher than the 1987-2019 average.

Analysis by Michael Saunders, a former Bank rate setter, now of the consultancy Oxford Economics, suggests a heightened sense of financial insecurity is one explanation. After the jarring shock of Covid shutdowns, the energy price spike, and soaring interest rates, that would make sense.

He is concerned this higher propensity to save could “cap consumer spending growth” for some time to come, dampening the economic recovery. But viewed in a festive spirit of optimism, it does indicate a capacity for some households to loosen their belts a little, if the mood should take them.

The fourth reason for hope is even more tentative, but potentially significant: recent productivity data has been improving.

In what Andrew Wishart of Berenberg bank called recently “the good news story of the year”, the key measure of economic output per worker (vital for lifting wages and living standards) rose by 1% in the first half of 2025. This puts productivity “on course to record one of its better years since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009”.

In some labour-intensive sectors, where there have been job cuts following Reeves’s changes to employer national insurance contributions (NICs), that is little more than a mathematical effect – fewer workers for a given level of GDP means more output per worker.

But Wishart’s early analysis also suggests productivity gains in other sectors, including IT. “We could plausibly be witnessing the beginnings of a boost from artificial intelligence,” he argues.

As Reeves’s former chief economic adviser, the London School of Economics academic John Van Reenen has long argued, UK businesses have tended to underinvest in technology and innovation, leaning instead on the plentiful supply of cheap workers.

Part of the largely unspoken logic of raising the minimum wage and employer NICs – which drove up the cost of hiring – was to tip the balance towards productivity-enhancing investment and innovation, which should be good for growth. Much, though, depends on the labour market’s capacity to re-absorb the workers laid-off in the process.

Lower interest rates from the Bank would help here, plus there are some indications that wage inflation is falling away. That could perhaps open the door to more rapid reductions.

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.

Parker-Hannifin Investment Narrative Recap

To own Parker Hannifin, you need to believe it can keep compounding earnings through a mix of industrial recovery, aerospace strength and disciplined capital allocation, even as growth expectations moderate.

Against this backdrop, the board’s decision to lift the quarterly dividend by 10% to US$1.80 per share in April 2025 and then maintain that level through late 2025 stands out as an important signal about cash generation and balance sheet comfort. For investors watching analyst optimism, those steady payout decisions help frame whether the current earnings and margin momentum can support both shareholder returns and the higher valuation the stock now carries.

Yet, even with this supportive backdrop, investors should be aware that Parker Hannifin’s increasing reliance on aerospace and longer cycle defense revenue could...

Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$668 to US$908, showing how far apart individual views on Parker Hannifin can sit.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.
Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said.
Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.","BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- As the number of skilled tradespeople dwindles in the United States, Walmart is trying to build up its own workforce to keep conveyor belts moving, refrigerated grocery cases cold, and drains and parking lots flowing.

The nation's largest retailer and private employer revamped its training program last year to increase the pipeline of maintenance technicians who do everything from repair equipment to electrical work at Walmart's distribution centers and stores -- jobs that have become increasingly difficult to fill because of a shrinking labor pool.

The shortage has opened opportunities for people like Liz Cardenas, 24, who started at Walmart in May 2023 as an automation equipment operator at a distribution center in Lancaster, Texas, making sure boxes were securely taped and went through a conveyer belt upright. Today, she is responsible for fixing conveyor belts and other equipment when they break at distribution centers.

Cardenas, who nearly doubled her hourly pay to $43.50 per hour, said she plans to pursue more training, which will mean an even higher salary and more responsibility. It also means financial freedom.

""I was able to move out of my parents' house,"" she said. ""I have my own apartment. I was able to get a car, and and I'm able to give more to my 401(k).""

A surge of retirements, along with a slowdown in immigration that began during the pandemic but now is accelerating with President Donald Trump's aggressive deportations, are among the main factors behind labor shortages that bedevil some employers, analysts say.

But in skilled trades, the problem is even more acute. Consulting firm McKinsey analyzed 12 types of trade job categories, including maintenance technicians, welders, and carpenters, and predicted an estimated imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new employee from 2022 to 2032.

McKinsey noted ""the extraordinary rate of churn"" could cost companies more than $5.3 billion every year in talent acquisition and training costs alone.

The shortages are happening as some companies are also laying off workers amid rising operational costs from new tariffs, shifting consumer spending and increased spending on artificial intelligence.

Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from roughly 150 companies representing millions of employees nationwide, launched in June a new initiative to address worker shortages in skilled trades, including maintenance technicians. The initiative, co-championed by home improvement retailer Lowe's, entails working with elementary, middle and high schools to raise awareness.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.

For its part, Lowe's in 2022 started a 90-day online training program for employees who want to pursue jobs like carpentry and utility maintenance. Separately, its charitable arm has invested $43 million since 2023 to 60 organizations including technical colleges and non-profit groups to help recruit and train skilled tradespeople like maintenance technicians and plumbers.

Mervin Jebaraj of the University of Arkansas's Walton College of Business in Fayetteville, Arkansas, noted these programs will help ease the shortages, but they won't eliminate the gap, particularly given Trump's clampdown on immigration.

""For as long as somebody physically needs to fix this, the shortage will persist, even though on the margins it'll mitigate some of the shortage,"" he said. ""We don't have enough people.""

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told The Associated Press he believes part of the reason for the shortages is ""lack of awareness.""

""I think most Americans probably don't know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs and that we can help them learn how to be a tech,"" he said. ""So we have a need to get the word out so that people know there are some great jobs.""

Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This year, it added new training sites in Vincennes, Indiana, and Jacksonville, Florida. The initiative combines hands-on instruction and classroom learning in fields like heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical work, and general maintenance.

As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said. With its first class of 108 associates who completed the Dallas/Fort Worth pilot program, every graduate secured a technician role, putting them on a path to earn an average of $32 per hour. Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.

R.J. Zanes, vice president of facility services for the U.S. divisions of Walmart and Sam's Club, said Walmart was able to attract workers from all over the country with different backgrounds, including employees running cash registers.

Maintenance technician roles are crucial to keeping Walmart's operations running smoothly, but especially so during the holiday season. For example, if a refrigeration system goes down within a Walmart store, it could cost up to $300,000 to $400,000 worth of lost product, according to Zanes.

""We've got to stay out in front of that,"" he said. ""We have to ensure that we've got the right skills there to do preventative maintenance, and when we do have a breakdown, to make sure that we get it back up as fast as possible to minimize that cost of downtime.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211816062_211816062-a2007b0fbd79460395fc47bc9686049a_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-12-21 06:59:43.031371

The mood is cautiously optimistic: the bulls still control the longer term trend, but the latest sessions show a market that is far more selective and sensitive to every new data point.

Live updates, products and investor resources on Adobe Inc. stock

One-Year Investment Performance

An investor who bought Adobe Inc. stock roughly a year ago and simply held on would today be sitting on an impressive gain, in the region of 25 to 35 percent depending on the exact entry point. That outperformance towers over the broader market and highlights how decisively the company has convinced Wall Street that its AI push and subscription engine can keep delivering double digit earnings growth. Yet that very success now fuels the main risk: sentiment has swung from skepticism to high expectations, which leaves less room for error if growth even slightly disappoints.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, traders continued to digest Adobe’s most recent earnings update, where the company once again demonstrated resilient demand in its core Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses. Management leaned heavily into the narrative that Firefly and other AI features are already driving higher engagement and willing-to-pay among professional users, a message that resonated with growth-focused investors.

Over the past several days, commentary has also circled back to competitive pressure from both traditional rivals and new AI-native tools, particularly those from big tech platforms and upstart design apps. While there have been no shocking negative headlines, the market has treated even small hints of pricing scrutiny or slower enterprise deal cycles as a reason to lock in profits, contributing to a choppy, consolidation-style trading pattern following the earlier surge.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street research desks remain broadly constructive on Adobe. Analysts at major houses such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs still frame the shares as a Buy, with price targets that typically imply upside in the low double digits from current levels. Others, including more valuation-focused firms like Bank of America and JPMorgan, have tended toward a more balanced stance, often at Overweight or Neutral, arguing that while the long term AI monetization story is compelling, the stock already discounts much of that growth. Taken together, the consensus skews positive but not euphoric: Adobe is widely viewed as a core quality holding in software, yet its premium multiple leaves little tolerance for execution missteps.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Adobe’s business model rests on deeply embedded creative and document software, sold almost entirely via recurring cloud subscriptions and increasingly enhanced with proprietary generative AI. The company’s next leg of performance will depend on three levers: how convincingly it can upsell AI features across its large installed base, whether it can maintain pricing power in the face of new low cost rivals, and how effectively it expands deeper into marketing and experience software for large enterprises. If management executes on that strategy and macro conditions remain stable, the stock has room to grind higher from consolidation, but any sign that AI monetization is slower than promised could quickly shift today’s cautious optimism back toward a more critical, valuation-driven reset.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405044_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 09:59:41.614629

A series of images shared on X highlighted how the SHANTI Bill 2025 promotes greater international cooperation by strengthening India's commitment to global best practices and international commitments, and by opening doors to developing reactors through international cooperation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that the passing of the SHANTI Bill by both Houses of Parliament marks a transformational moment for India's technology landscape and delivers a decisive boost to a clean-energy future for the country.

In a post on X, PM Modi said the bill also opens numerous opportunities for the private sector and our youth.

Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill, 2025 (SHANTI Bill).The Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha a day after it got approval in the Lok Sabha.

In his reply to the debate, Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh sought to allay opposition members' apprehensions and said the safety aspect has not been diluted.

The bill seeks to repeal the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010.

Jitendra Singh said the new legislation is aligned to achieve the objectives of increasing the share of nuclear energy in the total energy mix of India, will facilitate innovation in atomic science and technology, expand its applications to non-power applications and continue to honour India's obligations towards safety, security, safeguards and towards nuclear liability.

India has set an ambitious target to achieve energy independence, with a roadmap to decarbonise the economy by 2070 and to reach 100 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity by 2047.

The bill seeks to leverage the contribution of domestic nuclear energy to augment the global nuclear energy ecosystem.

Opposition members strongly demanded that the bill be referred to the standing or select committee, noting that it has wide-ranging implications and will have a lasting impact. They alleged that the government had diluted the liability clause and asked whether it was bringing the bill under any pressure. The amendments moved by the opposition members were negatived.

It went so 'wild' that the Nvidia CEO had to issue a clarification. During a fireside chat at the Center for Strategic and International Studies this month, Huang directly spoke about his statement on Chinese AI dominance vs America's. CSIS President John Hamre asked Huang what he termed ""very provocative"": You said something recently that was quite provocative. You said that China was winning the AI race, the AI competition. I know that you've got a powerful competitor in Huawei, and Huawei has a lot of advantages you don't have. Why don't you describe this competition? Are we really losing? In his reply to Hamre, Huang said, ""And it apparently caught a lot of attention. As you know with headlines, the disclaimer part, the foundation part was left out of the headline. But the way to think about that is that let me just handicap it right now. If you look at AI and go back to the first thing that we said, AI is a five layer cake. Let's just always simplify it. It's not quite this simplistic, but let's simplify AI into a five layer cake. Energy, chips, infrastructure, models, and applications. And let's handicap it from bottom to top. At the lowest level, China has twice the amount of energy we have as a nation.""

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

China dominance in Energy is one of the 'deal breakers'

""Twice as much energy as we have as a nation. And our economy's larger than theirs. Makes no sense to me. We also know that one of the most important initiatives, one of the most important policies of this administration. And there was the first thing that President Trump said to me when we met: ""Listen, we need to reindustrialize America. We need to do onshore manufacturing again. We need to help America make things again. "" It's going to create jobs. That part of the economy has been offshore and completely gutted the United States. We need to bring that back and he needs my help to do so. And so, that entire sector of the economy is missing,"" Nvidia CEO went on to add. Then Huang added the energy problem that America is facing, where China is miles ahead. While talking about the same Huang did give a compliment to President Trump, saying that he is trying his best to solve the problem. ""And however, without energy, how do we build chip plants, computer system plants, and these AI data centers? We call them AI factories. We're simultaneously building three different types of factories in the United States. Chip factories, super computer factories, and AI factories, they all require energy, every single one of them. And so on, the one hand, we want to reindustrialize the United States. How do you do that without energy? And so, the fact that we vilified energy for so long, President Trump sticking his neck out, and taking it on the chin, and helping the country realize that energy is necessary for our growth, is really one of the greatest things he's done right off the bat,"" Huang said.

America is generations ahead in Chips

He said that while America is 50% of China in energy, the country is generationals ahead in Chips. But at the same time warned that the country cannot afford to be complacent. As semiconductors is a manufacturing process and anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea. ""And so, now at the energy level, back to that stack, we're 50% and they're growing straight up. We're kind of flat right now. And so, number one, energy. Number two, chips. We're generations ahead. We are generations ahead on chips, and I think everybody recognizes that. Number three, infrastructure. If you want to build a data center here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years. They can build a hospital on a weekend. That's a real challenge. And so, at the infrastructure layer, their velocity of building things, because they are builders. Their velocity of building things is extraordinarily high. Now, really quickly on chips. We're several generations ahead, but don't be complacent. Remember, semiconductors are a manufacturing process. Anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea,"" Hunag said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's ‘China will win the AI race’ remark

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told the Financial Times in November this year that “China is going to win the AI race,” only to release a clarification statement soon after. Huang was speaking on the sidelines of the FT’s Future of AI Summit, where he warned that China would beat the US in artificial intelligence thanks to lower energy costs and looser regulations. However, several hours after the FT published its report, Nvidia issued a separate statement from Jensen on an official X account. “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,” he added.

In the 2010s, tech companies chased staff-level specialists: Backend engineers, data scientists, system architects. That model worked when technology evolved slowly. Specialists knew their craft, could deliver quickly and built careers on predictable foundations like cloud infrastructure or the latest JS framework

Then AI went mainstream.

The pace of change has exploded. New technologies appear and mature in less than a year. You can’t hire someone who has been building AI agents for five years, as the technology hasn’t existed for that long. The people thriving today aren’t those with the longest résumés; they’re the ones who learn fast, adapt fast and act without waiting for direction. Nowhere is this transformation more evident than in software engineering, which has likely experienced the most dramatic shift of all, evolving faster than almost any other field of work.

How AI Is rewriting the rules

AI has lowered the barrier to doing complex technical work, technical skills and it's also raised expectations for what counts as real expertise. McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated and 12 million workers may need to shift roles entirely. Technical depth still matters, but AI favors people who can figure things out as they go.

At my company, I see this every day. Engineers who never touched front-end code are now building UIs, while front-end developers are moving into back-end work. The technology keeps getting easier to use but the problems are harder because they span more disciplines.

In that kind of environment, being great at one thing isn’t enough. What matters is the ability to bridge engineering, product and operations to make good decisions quickly, even with imperfect information.

Despite all the excitement, only 1% of companies consider themselves truly mature in how they use AI. Many still rely on structures built for a slower era — layers of approval, rigid roles and an overreliance on specialists who can’t move outside their lane.

The traits of a strong generalist

A strong generalist has breadth without losing depth. They go deep in one or two domains but stay fluent across many. As David Epstein puts it in Range, “You have people walking around with all the knowledge of humanity on their phone, but they have no idea how to integrate it. We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning.” True expertise comes from connecting the dots, not just collecting information.

The best generalists share these traits:

Ownership: End-to-end accountability for outcomes, not just tasks.

First-principles thinking: Question assumptions, focus on the goal, and rebuild when needed.

Adaptability: Learn new domains quickly and move between them smoothly.

Agency: Act without waiting for approval and adjust as new information comes in.

Soft skills: Communicate clearly, align teams and keep customers’ needs in focus.

Range: Solve different kinds of problems and draw lessons across contexts.

I try to make accountability a priority for my teams. Everyone knows what they own, what success looks like and how it connects to the mission. Perfection isn’t the goal, forward movement is.

Embracing the shift

Focusing on adaptable builders changed everything. These are the people with the range and curiosity to use AI tools to learn quickly and execute confidently.

If you’re a builder who thrives in ambiguity, this is your time. The AI era rewards curiosity and initiative more than credentials. If you’re hiring, look ahead. The people who’ll move your company forward might not be the ones with the perfect résumé for the job. They’re the ones who can grow into what the company will need as it evolves.

The future belongs to generalists and to the companies that trust them.

What is Uber One?

Uber promoted its subscription UberOne, with a monthly cost of $9.99, as a way to save on travel and deliveries, ensuring that people could cancel it at any time.

However, the company misled users about the supposed savings and made the cancellation process considerably more difficult.

In some cases, people had to go through as much as 23 screens, perform 32 shares and wait for a response from a customer service representative to cancel the subscription.

Sometimes, Uber staff's delayed response resulted in the cancellation not being completed on time and another monthly charge being applied.

Despite offering a free trial period, Uber made automatic charges when users were unable to overcome these barriers, and even charged some people. before of the expected payment date.

In a spectacular showcase of triumph, Ducati recently celebrated yet another stellar season at their headquarters in Borgo Panigale during the ‘Campioni in Festa’ event. With Marc Márquez clinching his fourth consecutive title, Ducati solidifies its standing as the powerhouse of MotoGP, boasting a staggering six constructors’ championships. However, as the current regulatory era draws to a close, the racing landscape is set for an explosive transformation come 2027.

With an incredible 17 victories under their belt in 2025 alone, Ducati’s Desmosedici remains the benchmark as we gear up for the 2026 season. But the big question looms: will this dominance continue when the rules shift dramatically? The transition to 850cc engines, alongside significant aerodynamic restrictions and the ban on height devices, could spell trouble for the Italian giants. To further complicate matters, Pirelli tires will replace the long-standing Michelin, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to the upcoming championships.

Claudio Domenicali, Ducati’s CEO, has been vocal about the challenges ahead. “Unfortunately, some innovations that Ducati pioneered are being phased out of the regulations, like height devices and wings. From a regulatory and political standpoint, there are efforts to simplify the rules to prevent Ducati from creating any more groundbreaking technology. Nevertheless, our engineers are incredibly astute. We will have simpler bikes with fewer adjustments available, so we will see who can best navigate this new landscape,” Domenicali stated, highlighting the fierce competition that lies ahead.

As we set our sights on 2027, the rider market is heating up, with all major contracts expiring at the end of 2026. Márquez, undoubtedly the most coveted rider, is set to hit the market, creating a buzz of speculation. “Marc will be available, and naturally, that will be a topic of discussion. He’s been fantastic for us, and we for him, but everything is still to be evaluated. The same goes for Pecco Bagnaia, who has been with us for a considerable time. The market is open to all, but it’s too early to make any moves. I anticipate that the action will pick up around February or March,” Domenicali elaborated.

While there have been instances in the past where major signings occurred before the season kicked off, Domenicali cautions that it’s not always straightforward. “It’s not always that simple; it depends on the timing. Sometimes deals can be struck, and other times they cannot. There is a mutual will to collaborate, but it’s still a bit premature, and not all elements are in place for a smooth transition,” he commented.

Looking ahead, Ducati is also nurturing young talent like Fermín Aldeguer, but the primary focus remains on retaining the legendary #93. “Our philosophy is to support the growth of young riders, just as we did with Pecco and Jorge Martín, while also considering Aldeguer. At the same time, we are open to all possibilities, including Marc this year,” Domenicali affirmed.

As Ducati prepares for a new era in MotoGP, the stakes have never been higher. Will they maintain their grip on the championship, or will the new regulations pave the way for a shocking upset? One thing is for sure: the race to 2027 promises to be a thrilling spectacle!",https://motorcyclesports.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marc-Marquez.webp,N,,2025-12-21 07:59:30.221552

Chaos Erupts On Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 As ‘Hallucinating’ Passenger Tries To Open Emergency Exit At 39,000 Feet

On a recent Alaska Airlines flight, a passenger started hallucinating and understandably panicking when he thought the plane had lost its wings and that meth was coming out of the air vents. He had been talking to himself and showing signs of panic and aggravation throughout the flight. Then, when he attempted to open the emergency exit door mid-flight, it took 3 people to stop him. This is obviously a serious offense which could get him up to 20 years in prison, but the passenger was also obviously not in his right senses. Apparently, when medical examiners saw him upon landing, he told them he had been drinking for the last 10 days, had been hearing and seeing things, and was also on antidepressants. This reminds me just a bit of the time an Alaska Airlines pilot got high on psychedelic mushrooms and tried to turn the engines off mid-flight.

Uber could face billions in penalties across US after ‘deceptive billing and cancellation practices’

Uber is facing steep penalties for a myriad of issues, including making it confusing and difficult to cancel Uber One subscriptions, among other things. Some Uber customers said they had to go through more than 30 different “actions” across 23 different screens just to cancel their subscription! In this day of one-click functions, 30 actions is beyond frustrating. Customers also complained that the claims of how much savings they’d see with the Uber One membership were ultimately misleading, that discounts never showed up, that they were enrolled in Uber One without knowing it, or that fees kicked in before their free trials were even completed. Uber has many issues to address (or pay for) here.

10 amazing experiences in Northern Ireland

So many travel to Ireland, but Northern Ireland gets, I think, unfairly missed. The culture is magnetic and authentic to its core, and the terrain is both harsh and beautiful. In college, I spent two different semesters living abroad in Derry, Northern Ireland, where I got to do quite a lot of adventuring with local friends. In fact, the #5 recommendation on this list, “Walk 17th century walls,” features the 400+ year old wall that surrounds Derry, which I crossed nearly every day as I’d walk downtown to the chip shop or shopping center. And of course, Derry has a plethora of murals which tell the complex and emotional story of “the troubles” in the 60’s and beyond. (I lived just up the street from these murals, in fact.) But the most obvious recommendation on the list, at least for more light-hearted tourism, is the Causeway Coastal Route, where you can see both the bizarre hexagonal geography of the Giant’s Causeway and the adorably fairy-tale (yet also terrifyingly high) Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge. The Glens of Antrim will also give you the perfect, lush green fairytale landscapes you dream of with a trip to Ireland, so consider adding a few stops in Northern Ireland as well.

Skip The Crowds At Zion’s Narrows For This Equally Scenic Slot Canyon That’s A Day Trip From Las Vegas

My experience at the Narrows at Zion National Park was actually less inundated with crowds than is typical because I was there close to dusk when most (more safety-conscious and wise hikers) were already heading back to dry land. But it’s become one of the go-to hikes in Zion and, like Angel’s Landing, the crowds show it. I am always interested in a “try this instead of this” article if I think it could save me an overcrowded experience where I’m fighting through droves of tourists to snap a picture or catch a view. While I can’t vouch for this suggestion myself, I can vouch for the fact that Utah is absolutely littered with beautiful hikes and slot canyons, which don’t seem to attract more than a handful of visitors. So it doesn’t surprise me at all that a place like this would be both lesser-known and worthy of a visit. This hike is just 4 miles round-trip, but is described as somewhat challenging. Personally, when I’m in Utah, “somewhat challenging” is kind of what I’m looking for. Has anyone been to this spot to attest to its “off-the-beaten-path” nature?",https://frequentmiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/panic-inflight-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 20:58:46.586516

Until recently, discharge petitions were sparsely employed.
The Johnson-era discharge petitions similarly show he has less than an iron fist.
Sponsored by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it was joined by four House Republicans frustrated with Johnson’s refusal to allow any sort of vote on the subsidies.
You can argue that the sudden frequency of discharge petitions in Johnson’s House is mostly the product of exceptionally narrow party control (at present, the Republicans have just a three-vote majority).","For well over a century, the U.S. House has been a legislative chamber tightly controlled by its leaders. Unlike members of the Senate, House representatives have no automatic right to offer amendments to bills. The leadership-controlled Rules Committee has to certify access to the House floor for votes, plus all amendments. The Speaker’s leadership team controls all committee assignments, which aren’t as completely bound by seniority as they are in the Senate. And there’s no device like the Senate filibuster available in the House to empower minorities to block (and, in many cases, help shape) majority-backed legislation. Enhanced over the decades by especially powerful Speakers, ranging from the late 19th century’s Thomas B. “Czar” Reed to the early 21st century’s Nancy Pelosi, the so-called People’s House hasn’t been run in a particularly democratic manner, except to the extent that “the people” regularly change its composition — and often its partisan control — in two-year intervals.

Beginning in 1910, however, a rare path around the Speaker and the Rules Committee emerged: the so-called discharge petition, which, if signed by a simple majority of members, forces legislation to the floor for an immediate vote. It’s been used to bypass House leadership four times in the roughly two years since Mike Johnson became Speaker. That’s quite the historical anomaly, and it says a lot about the weakness of the current Speaker.

Until recently, discharge petitions were sparsely employed. As an AEI history of the procedure explains, as of 2023, “less than 4 percent of the 638 petitions begun since 1935 got the requisite 218 signatures, and something like 8 percent of bills targeted for discharge were passed by the House.”

Indeed, prior to Johnson’s ascent to the Speakership, only two 21st-century discharge petitions achieved the 218 signatures needed to trigger a floor vote. One, in 2002, forced a successful vote on the famous McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. The next, in 2015, forced a successful vote to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, an object of hatred for many conservative Republicans. The latter dispute was, at the time, interpreted as one of many signs of then-Speaker John Boehner’s weakness.

The Johnson-era discharge petitions similarly show he has less than an iron fist. The first, in September of 2024, involved bottled-up legislation to relieve public employees of a cut in retirement benefits; it was subsequently passed by both houses and signed by President Joe Biden near the end of his term. But the second, third, and fourth happened in quick succession in the autumn of this year.

There was the most famous: the Democrat-generated petition to force a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Johnson’s futile efforts to head off its success had much to do with his decision to keep the House from meeting before and throughout the longest government shutdown in history. But he couldn’t stop it forever, and eventually he (along with Donald Trump and most congressional Republicans) surrendered and backed the bill. Then another Democrat-created petition, which hit 218 signatures in late November and forced a successful vote on a bill to reverse Trump’s efforts to kill collective-bargaining rights among federal employees. And the latest, filed just last week, will force a vote on a “clean” extension of expiring Obamacare premium subsidies. Sponsored by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it was joined by four House Republicans frustrated with Johnson’s refusal to allow any sort of vote on the subsidies. The vote will take place once the House returns from its Christmas break in January.

You can argue that the sudden frequency of discharge petitions in Johnson’s House is mostly the product of exceptionally narrow party control (at present, the Republicans have just a three-vote majority). But Pelosi had some periods of very narrow partisan control during her last two years as Speaker, 2021 and 2022, and never faced this sort of open revolt.

Without question, Johnson’s grip on the gavel is becoming slippery. The odds are high he’ll lose it in next year’s midterm elections. But signs of weakness invite further revolts by House members who fear voters more than this mild-mannered former backbencher from Louisiana, whose authority is totally dependent on Trump’s backing, which can be erratic during times when the president is distracted by nonlegislative matters like ending wars and naming things after himself. Politicians, like guard dogs, can smell fear and irresolution. If discharge petitions keep popping up and forcing votes, Johnson may lose control of the House altogether and not even make it to the midterms as Speaker.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/349/584/0e629e1a77c3c33b5562465455ef2235ee-Mike-Johnson-lede.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:35.954060

SoftBank pledged in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with $10 billion delivered immediately.
SoftBank’s aggressive push to fund OpenAI illustrates the high stakes of the AI race and the lengths even the world’s most seasoned investors will go to secure a foothold in the sector.","SoftBank Group is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by the end of the year, employing a mix of cash-raising strategies that include selling stakes in major holdings and leveraging margin loans, sources told Reuters. The push marks one of the boldest moves yet by CEO Masayoshi Son, as the Japanese billionaire aims to strengthen SoftBank’s position in the increasingly competitive artificial intelligence sector.

To assemble the necessary capital, Son has already sold SoftBank’s entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia, offloaded $4.8 billion in T-Mobile US shares, and implemented staff reductions across the group. Dealmaking at SoftBank’s Vision Fund has slowed dramatically, with any investment exceeding $50 million now requiring Son’s explicit approval, sources said.

In addition to divestments, SoftBank is moving forward with its plan to take its payments operator PayPay public. Originally slated for this month, the initial public offering was delayed due to the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. The debut is now expected in the first quarter of next year and could raise more than $20 billion, according to sources familiar with the process.

SoftBank is also exploring partial exits from its holdings in Didi Global, China’s major ride-hailing operator. Didi plans to relist in Hong Kong after a U.S. delisting in 2021, following a regulatory crackdown, a source said. Vision Fund managers are being directed to prioritize the OpenAI deal over other opportunities.

The urgency to secure funds underscores the financial strain even the largest global investors face as they seek to finance massive AI projects, including data centers costing hundreds of billions of dollars. SoftBank has multiple avenues to tap, including cash on its balance sheet, corporate bonds, margin loans, and stakes in listed companies.

A significant source of capital could come from SoftBank’s undrawn margin loans backed by its 100% ownership of Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor and software design company. The firm recently expanded this borrowing capacity by $6.5 billion, bringing total undrawn loans to $11.5 billion. Arm’s stock has more than tripled since its IPO, giving SoftBank additional collateral to support new borrowing.

As of September 30, SoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen ($27.16 billion) and still holds about 4% of T-Mobile US, valued at roughly $11 billion. Despite slowing new investments, the company has continued backing AI startups including Sierra and Skild AI.

The funding is critical for OpenAI, which, alongside SoftBank, is investing in Stargate, a $500 billion initiative to build AI data centers for training and inference. These centers are considered crucial to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in AI against China. The push to expand data center capacity has also prompted tech giants like Meta to commit massive capital, raising concerns about potential overinvestment in the sector.

SoftBank pledged in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with $10 billion delivered immediately. The remaining funds were contingent on OpenAI transitioning to a for-profit structure by year-end—a milestone it achieved in October.

The new capital will help OpenAI cover soaring costs for training and operating its AI models as competition intensifies from Google’s Gemini and other rivals. CEO Sam Altman recently described the company as entering a “code red” phase to enhance ChatGPT, temporarily delaying other product rollouts. OpenAI’s long-term ambitions remain staggering: Altman has outlined plans to build 30 gigawatts of computing capacity for $1.4 trillion and ultimately add one gigawatt of compute per week, with each gigawatt costing over $40 billion.

Gemini 3 Flash benchmark performance is stellar: 78.0% on SWE-bench Verified, 95.2% on AIME 2025, 33.7% on HLE. This beats Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 overall and comes close to Gemini 3 Pro, even beating the latter on SWE-Bench Verified.

Gemini 3 Flash is trained for broad usage across real-time workflows and agentic applications, and Google is deploying it widely, using it as the new default in the Gemini app, AI Mode in Google Search, and Google’s developer tools such as Gemini API, Android Studio, and Vertex AI. The API cost for Gemini 3 Flash is $0.50/M input tokens and $3.00/M output tokens, higher than Gemini 2.5 Flash but significantly less than competing similar-performing AI models. This makes Gemini 3 Flash a good daily driver AI model for many use cases.

And the settings, which sit in a revamped Personalization menu, allow people to opt for More, Less, or Default for any given characteristic and add new toggles that determine whether the bot will write headers and lists. It’s a minor UI change with major implications: Users no longer have to constantly tap for “less peppy” or “friendlier” replies, while teams can adjust the AI’s tone more closely to brand or context.

What’s New in ChatGPT Personalization Settings

The Personalization controls are more like Grecian Formula than personality transplants. Want energetic brainstorming? Set enthusiasm to More. Need a neutral compliance summary? (Set Less for warmth and emoji use here.) The additions supplement the November trio of base styles Professional, Candid, and Quirky, so users can add a general tone along with more specific tweaks. OpenAI also factored in preferences for structural choices, enabling the assistant to default to including lists and headers for scannability or just stick with plain paragraphs if a narrative answer is more appropriate.

Why Tone Control Matters for ChatGPT Users

ChatGPT’s tone has been a flashpoint all year. One update was a little too agreeable and swept into reverse when users objected to “sycophantic” behavior. It then adjusted its latest model to be warmer after hearing that the responses were becoming too clinical. The new controls are a practical solution; instead of trying to secure a timeless voice that appeals to everyone, OpenAI is turning people loose on the volume knob for friendliness and flair.

There’s also a behavioral safety aspect. Researchers at Stanford and Anthropic have written about how big language models may be too ready to reproduce what users think, a trend critics worry could foster reliance or create echo chambers. Tinkering with enthusiasm and warmth — it won’t solve that altogether, but gives users and companies a way to “tone down the flattery,” to rein in gushing praise, and keep interactions more firmly grounded — particularly in delicate arenas like mental health counseling or news consumption.

Early Use Cases and Real-Life Examples for Teams

And support teams can standardize their replies by turning the warmth slider to More and keeping enthusiasm at Default, which would generate warm but not effusive messages. Recruiters can decrease or limit emojis for candidate outreach to appear more professional, while marketing teams can increase engagement around brainstorming content ideas. Teachers could opt for Less warmth, sunshiny esprit during grading, sounding purely neutral and reading plainly as opposed to cheerily.

The structure toggles matter, too. The assistant can be biased toward short bullet lists and headings if the analysts who are writing executive summaries tend to do so, or the opposite, if, with complex legal issues, it is better to use flowing prose. There’s also a tangential upside in instant efficiency: A few key settings can cut down on the kind of redundant guidelines (there are no emojis here!) or suggestions like “list, not paragraphs,” which can free up some tokens and help keep responses more consistent among your team anyway.

How It Fits With the Other Controls Already in Place

These dials stack on top of system instructions, custom profiles, and base style presets. Base styles are like the general color palette, and the new controls are saturation and brightness sliders. Companies that employ admin policies can set defaults that suit their brand voice and let users dial it in to individual preferences. At a high level this negates the need for power-users to default to tone design through verbose prompts, by considering it as a first-class stateful setting.

Limitations and Open Questions for Tone Controls

You can then use these weights to refine the results returned by PageRank according to your particular preferences. These controls are purposefully straightforward (More, Less, Default) and you won’t be assured of producing consistent outputs across all queries or domains. Context still helps; technical and creative topics naturally lend themselves to cooler and flashier terms. It’s also not clear how these settings interact with shared workspaces, if org-level defaults outweigh user preferences, and how the model weighs several settings if they contradict (for instance, high enthusiasm but low emoji use).

The Broader Context of AI Controllability

Steerability — the ability for a user to have some control over style without losing substance — is an emerging battleground. Microsoft’s writing assistants and productivity tools already include controls for tone, like Formal or Casual, as enterprise buyers increasingly demand governance features that lock down voice and guard against behavioral drift. Analysts at organizations such as Gartner have described controllability as a cornerstone in scaling responsible generative AI, because it helps maintain brand consistency, cut prompt variance and achieve compliance expectations.

OpenAI’s decision does not halt arguments about how models should behave, but it does alter the balance of power toward users. Rather than suffering through a one-size-fits-all personality, you can set the vibe once and then get on with it. For everyone who is sick of getting encouraged when they just wanted the facts — or conversely, wished the bot sounded less like a tax memo — that’s a welcome change.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai_adds_passion_controls_to_chatgpt_tone_setti_edited_1766268246.png,N,,2025-12-20 20:58:42.900827

It’s another record for the sector, and further evidence that concerns around an AI slowdown haven’t dampened investor enthusiasm.

AI Infrastructure Demand Drives Record Deals

S&P Global credits the increase to hyperscale buildouts intended to service compute-hungry training and inference workloads. Cloud providers and AI platform operators are locking up multi-year capacity, usually pre-leasing entire campuses prior to breaking ground. Sorry, there are no AI applications in the world that prove killer at scale. However, industry consultants speaking to CNBC noted that demand for these kinds of AI workloads is robust in the data center: GPU clusters, high-density racks, and specialized networking still fetch premium prices.

Markets with available power and fiber—such as Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” Phoenix, Dallas, or parts of Ohio—still attract mega-campuses, while Europe’s main hubs like Frankfurt and Dublin are limited by permitting constraints and grid capacity. Developers are also branching out in so-called second-tier metros where utilities can act more quickly, and combining sites with long-term renewable power contracts to help businesses meet corporate sustainability goals.

Private Equity Drives the Financing Wave

Behind the headline number, a majority of financing is private equity and structured debt, S&P Global notes. That’s partly because of the sheer capital intensity of modern campuses — often billions per site — and rising interest rates, making buyers with cash and flexible balance sheets more attractive. Big infrastructure funds and alternative asset managers have swooped down through platform acquisitions, joint ventures, and sale-leasebacks, exchanging stable, contracted cash flows for more leverage.

The model is not foolproof. These debt-laden structures rely on fast delivery schedules, consistent lease-up, and cheap power. Running behind schedule for utility interconnections, the supply of GPUs, or a halt in AI spending could reduce returns. Yet with committed anchors in place and 10- to 20-year power and land strategies, many operators argue that, at their core, the fundamentals look more like those of infrastructure than cyclical tech.

Power and Land Limits Define Development Strategy

Capacity is as much a question of electricity — no longer just real estate. An S&P Global outlook predicted that data center power draw — currently on pace to grow by around 22% over the planning period, and potentially triple by decade’s end — accounted for roughly 2% of global electricity demand last year. That is in line with trends monitored by the International Energy Agency and Uptime Institute that indicate longer interconnection queues, transformer constraints, and competition with industrial loads.

Operators are adapting with multi-pronged strategies:

Secure a renewable PPA several years ahead of time

Design for liquid cooling to support high-density AI nodes

Co-locate facilities next to generation

Investigate on-site resources like battery storage or fuel cells to work around grid constraints

In some metros, utilities have made queuing reforms or phased caps a condition for interconnection, which has forced developers to divide campuses between service territories in order to spread risk.

Community Pushback and the Policy Response

As investors rush ahead, local opposition is gaining strength. A coalition of more than 300 environmental and civic groups recently asked governors and state regulators to pause approvals of large-scale data centers until they could demand better assessments of water use, emissions, and grid impacts. In some cases, community challenges have delayed or altered projects in locales like Virginia and Wisconsin, where residents and advocacy organizations have voiced concerns about noise, diesel backup generators, and tax incentives.

Policymakers are pulling in divergent directions. Some state and federal officials are trying to expedite permits for AI infrastructure; others are adding guardrails on siting, water withdrawals, and energy acquisition. European regulators, meanwhile, are raising the bar for efficiency reporting and heat-reuse requirements that might also affect design decisions worldwide.

Investor and Operator Outlook for Data Centers

What follows will depend on three variables: the availability of power, the supply of chips, and the cost of capital. If utilities can add capacity quickly enough, and if buyers of AI maintain multi-year commitments, today’s pipeline may translate into reliable cash flows linked to inflation. If not, the dollars will probably increasingly flow to markets equipped with faster interconnects and modular design, as well as hybrid models that offer wholesale, colocation, and build-to-suit capabilities.

For now, the number that counts is $61 billion. It’s a portrait of an industry in full buildout mode, with capital pursuing compute as AI moves from pilots to production. As the researchers and market analysts of S&P Global point out to CNBC and other outlets, the bottlenecks are real — but so is the demand.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_edited_1766264524.png,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:39.817370

Airports in New York, Tampa, Chicago, Dallas, Des Moines, and more are seeing widespread impacts as flight schedules are heavily affected. Weather conditions, airport congestion, and increased air traffic volumes are major contributors to these delays. Passengers are experiencing long wait times and frustration, with many flights being delayed or canceled at some of the busiest airports in the country.

As a result, travelers are being advised to stay updated on their flight statuses and contact airlines for rebooking options. With major cities like New York, Chicago, and Dallas reporting significant disruptions, this has become one of the most challenging travel days of the year for many.

Disruption Causes: Reasons Behind the Delays

Today, travelers across the U.S. are facing significant disruptions with 4,603 delays and 257 cancellations reported. These widespread travel issues, affecting major airports and airlines, are primarily caused by factors like weather conditions, airport congestion, and increased volumes, leading to longer wait times for passengers.

At Aspen/Pitkin County Airport (ASE), low ceilings are causing an average delay of 112 minutes, as poor visibility forces aircraft to hold or delay departures. Akron-Canton Airport (CAK) is experiencing delays due to deicing procedures, essential for flight safety when ice forms on aircraft. Eagle County Airport (EGE) reports 100-minute delays due to high airport volume, especially during peak travel times, leading to congestion and slower processing. Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is dealing with 45-minute delays (and increasing), as both high air traffic volume and weather-related factors intensify the situation.

Westchester County Airport (HPN) has an average 30-minute delay caused by departure volume, as the number of departing flights exceeds capacity. San Diego International Airport (SAN) is also affected by high volumes, leading to progressively longer delays. At Teterboro Airport (TEB), traffic management initiatives are causing 90-minute delays, while Van Nuys Airport (VNY) is experiencing delays due to compact demand, as a high volume of flights operates within limited time frames.

Airports affected across U.S.

Major airports across the U.S. are facing significant disruptions today. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) leads with 30 cancellations and 402 delays, making it one of the hardest-hit airports. Los Angeles International (LAX) follows closely with 19 cancellations and 233 delays, contributing to widespread travel challenges. Newark Liberty International (EWR) is also affected, reporting 17 cancellations and 155 delays, highlighting the busy airport’s struggle to manage traffic. Dallas-Fort Worth International (DFW) is experiencing 14 cancellations and 223 delays, impacting travelers flying in and out of Dallas. Similarly, Orlando International (MCO) reports 14 cancellations and 155 delays, leaving many passengers frustrated as they face long wait times.

U.S. Airlines affected

Today, several major U.S. airlines are experiencing significant disruptions with cancellations and delays affecting thousands of passengers. PSA Airlines, operating for American Airlines, has experienced the highest number of cancellations today, with 43 cancellations and 125 delays. Delta Air Lines is one of the most impacted, reporting 35 cancellations and 370 delays. Southwest Airlines follows closely, with 29 cancellations and a staggering 727 delays, significantly affecting its extensive domestic network. Spirit Airlines has also been hit hard, with 37 cancellations and 166 delays, while American Airlines is managing 3 cancellations and 423 delays. United Airlines reports 12 cancellations and 308 delays, contributing to widespread frustration at major airports.

Impact on Passengers: What Travelers Can Do Now

U.S. Travelers facing delays today due to low ceilings, deicing, airport congestion, and increased volumes should take several steps to manage the situation. First, it’s essential to stay informed about flight status by regularly checking updates, as departure times may change depending on airport conditions. If experiencing extended delays or cancellations, contact your airline for rebooking or compensation options, as many airlines offer alternate flights or vouchers.

Conclusion

Today’s flight disruptions across U.S. airports are largely due to factors such as weather conditions, airport congestion, and high volumes of air traffic. Passengers traveling through affected airports like ASE, EWR, HPN, SAN, and VNY should be prepared for delays and make sure to stay informed about the status of their flights. With over 4,603 delays and 257 cancellations, flexibility, and communication with airlines are key to managing the day’s challenges.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-travel.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:26.613993

FCMB posts strong earnings, recapitalization on track Founded in 1982 by Otunba Subomi Balogun, FCMB has grown into one of Nigeria’s leading financial groups, serving retail, commercial and institutional clients.
Under Ladi Balogun, the bank has expanded its income base and posted solid results in a high-interest-rate environment.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, FCMB reported gross earnings of N828.1 billion ($570 million), up 40.9 percent from a year earlier.
Total assets stood at N7.23 trillion ($4.97 billion), while assets under management rose to N1.59 trillion ($1.09 billion).","FCMB Group, a financial services holding company led by Nigerian banking executive Ladi Balogun, has secured shareholder approval to raise up to N400 billion ($274 million), a move that clears a major hurdle as the Nigerian financial services holding company works to retain its international banking license and comply with new regulatory capital requirements.

The approval was granted at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), where shareholders endorsed an expanded capital plan that management says will place the group well ahead of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s March 2026 recapitalization deadline. For FCMB, this offers both regulatory breathing room and a vote of confidence after a year of strong earnings growth.

FCMB funds growth, tech, offshore expansion

In a filing with the Nigerian Exchange, the group said its banking subsidiary is already on course to meet the higher capital threshold. FCMB noted that it has completed a public offer and expects to close the sale of a minority stake in one of its units before the end of December.

“Subject to capital verification by the CBN, shareholder approval and the required regulatory consents, we are positioned to deliver the N500 billion capital target ahead of the March 2026 deadline for FCMB Limited,” the company said in the filing.

Speaking at the meeting, Group CEO Ladi Balogun thanked shareholders for their backing and said the additional funds would be used carefully, with a focus on balance sheet strength and long-term returns. He added that the capital will help improve capital adequacy, lower reliance on expensive deposits, and support investments in staff, technology and its offshore operations.

Strong returns expected for shareholders

Balogun also outlined expectations for shareholder returns, saying the group expects earnings per share to rise by more than 50 percent on average over the next two years. He added that a stronger capital position should support higher dividend payments, with the capital adequacy ratio projected to remain above 20 percent.

Shareholders also approved the acceptance of oversubscription from the group’s 2025 public offer, subject to limits set by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory approvals. FCMB said the oversubscription reflects strong investor demand for its shares.

As part of the resolution, FCMB’s issued share capital will increase from N30 billion through the creation of additional ordinary shares required to complete the capital raise. The new shares will rank equally with existing shares.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, FCMB reported gross earnings of N828.1 billion ($570 million), up 40.9 percent from a year earlier. Interest income climbed 64.7 percent, offsetting a decline in non-interest income caused by lower currency revaluation gains. Profit after tax rose 52 percent to N125.45 billion ($86.2 million), lifting return on average equity to 22.4 percent.

Total assets stood at N7.23 trillion ($4.97 billion), while assets under management rose to N1.59 trillion ($1.09 billion). Retained earnings increased to N291.9 billion ($200.6 million). With capital verification underway and regulatory approvals pending, FCMB says it remains on track to complete its recapitalization well before the 2026 deadline, positioning the group for growth.",https://www.billionaires.africa/content/images/2025/12/Ladi-Balogun-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:51.430959

And any hiccups — a winter storm or a computer outage — can snowball into massive disruptions.That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have “interline agreements” that let them put stranded customers on another carrier’s flights.This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That’s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.“When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,” said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.“They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,” and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard.Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn’t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.“While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,” TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.AAA advises travelers to “continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,” spokesperson Diaz said. “Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.”Planning ahead for 2025Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.“Because travel is so popular, you’re not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,” Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. “If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.”

Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it’s beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S.

The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year’s Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019.

Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.

A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.

What will be the busiest travel days?

Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day.

The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.

About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.

“Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,” AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.

This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.

Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That’s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.

“When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,” said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.

People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.

“They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,” and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.

Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard.

Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.

Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?

A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn’t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.

More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.

“While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,” TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.

AAA advises travelers to “continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,” spokesperson Diaz said. “Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.”

Planning ahead for 2025

Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.

“Because travel is so popular, you’re not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,” Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. “If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.”","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/xna-travelers-november-2025-692372bb42fd7.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-20 17:02:11.299151

And yet many of the same questions and challenges remain: Who gets left behind when public health systems collapse under political pressure or moral panic?
In a time of renewed political backlash and public health failures, GMHC’s story is more than history – it’s a guide.","The story of the AIDS movement is one of regular people: students, bartenders, stay-at-home mothers, teachers, retired lawyers, immigrants, Catholic nuns, newly out gay men who had just arrived in New York, and many others. Some had lost friends or lovers. Some felt a moral calling. Some were just trying to balance their sexual karma. Many were angry. Most had no medical background or professional credentials – just a sense of urgency, tenacity and an unwillingness to look away.

When Gay Men’s Health Crisis, the world’s first AIDS service organization, was founded in 1982, it was regular people trying to meet the needs of all people living with AIDS. Its workforce of volunteers provided HIV prevention education as well as physical, emotional and legal support.

At the start of the epidemic, AIDS was considered a “gay plague,” and to be openly queer was to risk abandonment, eviction, assault or worse. Families disowned their children. Hospitals turned patients away. Funeral homes refused bodies. And many people with AIDS found themselves alone and in need.

Public officials didn’t just fail to act – they refused to acknowledge that anything was happening at all. Elected leaders such as President Ronald Reagan and Sen. Jesse Helms stoked the moral panic guiding public policy by declaring people with AIDS “perverted human being(s).”

In 2025, with the Trump administration cutting federal funding for HIV research and support services and restricting protections and services for LGBTQ+ people, studying how everyday people approached the early AIDS crisis provides a model for surviving through innovation, commitment and community.

Stories informing the present

“I think 26,000 people died before (Reagan) even bothered to utter the word ‘AIDS,’” said Tim Sweeney, former executive director of Gay Men’s Health Crisis.

This quote is featured in the GMHC Stories Oral History Project, a collection of over 100 interviews with former volunteers, staff and donors from the first 15 years of the organization. Along with our colleague Julia Haager, we and our team at Binghamton University’s Human Sexualities Lab compiled these interviews. Acquired by the Manuscripts and Archives Division of The New York Public Library, the collection is scheduled to open in fall 2025, showcasing how everyday people responded to the AIDS crisis.

These stories document how a community presented with a set of circumstances threatening their very existence built a self-sustaining organization to advocate for and provide care to each other outside institutional support. They did this while enduring grief, standing up to external threats and navigating internal tensions.

Improvisation for survival

The work was an ongoing challenge. Organizations dedicated to aiding people affected by AIDS such as Gay Men’s Health Crisis were left to fund their own survival – and defend their right to do the work. When North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms moved in 1988 to eliminate federal support for AIDS service programs that mentioned homosexuality, it severely limited AIDS prevention efforts nation wide. However, GMHC had the foresight to fund its more explicit education materials with private donations.

At the beginning of the epidemic, queer New Yorkers and their allies had to improvise new systems of care in the absence of state and federal support. “People often (ask) me, what was the model you worked off of?” said Sweeney. “And I said, there was no model, there was just a muddle. We just made it up the whole time.”

What they created almost overnight was staggering. “There were over 1,000 volunteers in the agency,” recalled staff member Tom Weber, who started at GMHC as an office volunteer in 1988. “We would have orientations every single week, and they would flood in.”

One of the most well-known expressions of that volunteer labor was the buddy program, where lay caregivers provided emotional and practical support to people living with AIDS. “A lot of people were not alone in their death because of the work that we did,” said Barbara Danish, who led the buddy program from 1996 to 2002.

Education and prevention were also grounded in queer culture and community. Unlike early depictions of AIDS in the media that reduced patients to “vectors” of transmission, it was defiantly sex-positive. “We came up with shit that no one in the world had ever done,” Sweeney said. “Because finally it was gay men saying … we’re going to talk to each other about how to stay safe, healthy and sexy.”

When that sense of mission extended to emotional survival, humor and unapologetically queer culture were critical to bearing the weight of the work. “Sometimes you just break down and cry for an hour. But that’s how you survive it – by staying authentic to your emotions,” said Tommy Thomson, former director of client programs. She recalled how staff member “Carolotta,” or Carl, would sometimes put condoms and chocolate in a basket and go from office to office, frequently in drag. He would offer either or both to make people feel better. “He’d make you remember that you weren’t alone, and that we all know how hard it is. That’s part of what held you together.”

Internal tensions

Although Gay Men’s Health Crisis remained mission-driven, its internal politics were never simple. As it grew in size and national stature, it confronted the limits of its founding identity.

Founded by, and initially serving, primarily white gay men, GMHC sometimes struggled to adapt to the emerging realities of the epidemic. While AIDS also affected people of color, women and intravenous drug users from the outset, much of the agency’s early prevention and outreach work was designed with gay men in mind.

By the late 1980s, the increase in AIDS cases among white gay men had begun to plateau, while rates among Black and Latino people, women and IV drug users continued to rise sharply into the next decade. Women and people of color who were deeply embedded in GMHC’s operations nonetheless had to navigate assumptions about whose needs were prioritized – assumptions that often manifested in how resources were allocated and services were designed. As GMHC expanded its outreach to Black and Latino populations, it struggled to be culturally responsive and build trust in communities that had long been underserved and stigmatized.

As GMHC grew, it became more and more successful in fundraising and visibility, while smaller organizations sometimes struggled to access resources. This led to growing tensions, particularly in communities of color, where local groups feared that GMHC’s expansion would limit funding and undercut their efforts at community-specific approaches to care and prevention. In addition, efforts to address racism, sexism and cultural insensitivity encountered both support and indifference.

Yet, staff and volunteers continued to push – reshaping messaging, fighting for inclusive programming, and holding conversations about race, gender, power and public health. For staff and volunteers, the agency was a complicated institution that could both empower and marginalize. Its strength, and its struggle, was learning how to expand without losing sight of the legacy and history it was built on.

A guide for today

Forty years later, LGBTQ+ people face a new set of crises in a landscape riddled with dangers.

Trans health care is being banned in multiple states. Book bans and surveillance laws are targeting queer youth. Anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is fueling violence and censorship. Funding for HIV prevention and research is disappearing even as new infections persist. Black and brown communities still face disproportionate barriers to health care and housing. Decades of scientific progress and medical discoveries are coming to a halt with funding cuts under the Trump administration.

And yet many of the same questions and challenges remain: Who gets left behind when public health systems collapse under political pressure or moral panic? Who will do the work when institutions fail? What does it mean to care for one another in the midst of the wreckage? How do people come together across differences?

The history of GMHC is more than memory – it is a lesson in the possibility of care, creativity and community, especially in the face of fear and uncertainty today. It shows how people can come together – not just to demand policy change, but to directly meet one another’s needs with whatever resources they have. It is a reminder that mutual aid is powerful; that grief can coexist with joy; and that queer resilience has always included laughter, desire and shared vulnerability. In a time of renewed political backlash and public health failures, GMHC’s story is more than history – it’s a guide. Today, the staff and volunteers at GMHC continue their work to confront the epidemic and uplift the lives of all people affected by AIDS.

“We’d say to them, ‘You’re just ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things,’” Sweeney said. “And we really meant that.”

What was once met with caution, policy debates and outright bans is now being woven into the daily rhythm of academic life. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is emerging as an early beneficiary of that shift, quietly securing a foothold in higher education as universities rethink how students learn, research and work.

Across public university systems, ChatGPT is no longer treated as a fringe study tool. Institutions are increasingly licensing the platform for broad use among students and faculty, signaling a move away from enforcement toward education. The change reflects a growing belief that generative AI is not a temporary disruption but a permanent presence in modern learning.

ChatGPT finds early footing on campuses

OpenAI has sold more than 700,000 ChatGPT licenses across about 35 public universities, according to Bloomberg. These agreements typically cover both students and faculty, positioning the software as a general-purpose academic assistant rather than a single-use product.

On campuses, ChatGPT is being used for writing support, coding help, data analysis and research preparation. Faculty members rely on it to streamline administrative tasks and curriculum planning, while students turn to it as an everyday aid for organizing ideas and solving problems. That wide range of uses has helped normalize the tool within academic environments that once viewed AI with skepticism.

Unlike earlier educational technologies that arrived through top-down mandates, ChatGPT has spread partly through student demand. Many undergraduates arrive already familiar with the platform, having used it before enrolling. Universities that adopt it formally are often responding to existing behavior rather than introducing something entirely new.

Why students gravitate toward ChatGPT

While major competitors also offer AI tools, adoption patterns suggest a divide in how those products are used. Microsoft’s Copilot, often bundled into enterprise software agreements, tends to see heavier use among faculty and administrative staff. ChatGPT, by contrast, has gained traction as a standalone product that students actively seek out.

That distinction matters. Tools chosen voluntarily are more likely to shape habits, especially during formative years. As students integrate ChatGPT into their workflows, faculty are adjusting assignments and expectations, reinforcing its role rather than attempting to restrict it.

OpenAI appears intent on reaching users early, before academic routines and professional habits are firmly established. The strategy mirrors how other digital platforms gained long-term influence by becoming familiar during school years.

Teaching responsible use instead of bans

Universities are increasingly framing AI as something to be taught responsibly rather than prohibited. Many institutions now focus on guiding students in ethical use, verification of outputs and understanding limitations. This approach reflects a broader shift in academic culture, one that recognizes AI literacy as a necessary skill.

The change also acknowledges reality. Policing AI use has proven difficult, while thoughtful integration offers a chance to shape how students engage with emerging technology. For administrators, the question is no longer whether students will use AI, but how.

Education’s role in OpenAI’s bigger ambitions

OpenAI’s expanding presence in higher education comes as the company’s ambitions continue to grow. Separate reports indicate it has held early discussions with investors about raising up to $100 billion at a valuation near $750 billion, up sharply from the roughly $500 billion figure tied to a secondary share sale earlier this year.

The company is also widely reported to be laying groundwork for a future initial public offering, potentially as soon as 2026, with some projections placing its value close to $1 trillion. Those figures highlight how central scale and long-term adoption are to OpenAI’s strategy.

Education plays a unique role in that vision. If ChatGPT becomes the default AI assistant for students today, it may influence how future workers write, code and think. In a crowded AI market, familiarity can translate into loyalty.

For now, OpenAI’s growing presence on campuses reflects a broader reality. Artificial intelligence is no longer an experiment in higher education. It is becoming part of the infrastructure.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2378605551.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 19:01:40.727693

The forecast arrives as content leaders face escalating demands—95.2% consider visual content critical for business communications, according to Adobe research cited in the report. Content needs are growing between five and twenty times current levels.

The report synthesized extensive internal and external research alongside feedback from Adobe Creative Cloud communities. According to Deepa Subramaniam, Vice President of Product Marketing for Creative Professionals at Adobe, creativity now faces a ""perfect storm"" of soaring content demands, reduced resources, and transformative AI capabilities. ""The most forward-thinking teams aren't just adding new tools,"" Subramaniam stated in the report. ""They're building systems that bring people, ideas, and workflows together in a more connected, collaborative way.""

Four trends emerged from Adobe's analysis. Each addresses different aspects of visual communication, from sensory engagement to cultural authenticity.

Multisensory visual experiences

The first trend emphasizes creating content that engages multiple senses simultaneously through texture, motion, sound, and implied sensory qualities. Research cited by The Drum showed 82% of global consumers expect their senses engaged when experiencing new content.

Brenda Mills, Principal of Consumer and Creative Insights at Adobe, explained the shift in the report. ""Our lives are so screen-focused that, since the Covid shutdown, people have had an insatiable desire to have all their senses engaged,"" Mills stated. ""We are living in a crowded visual landscape, so people expect images to deliver more than ever before.""

WGSN research referenced in Adobe's report indicated 68% of customers want brands to create remarkable out-of-the-box campaigns. An additional 78% demonstrate higher likelihood to purchase from brands making them feel joy.

The technical implementation requires designing AI prompts describing more than visual appearance. Prompts must suggest how content might feel, sound, or smell. Audio elements become essential components rather than supplementary additions.

Corporate Reputation Review published research finding that engaging multiple senses significantly enhanced brand experience and customer satisfaction among Chinese consumers. The study suggested this pattern extends globally.

Adobe's GenStudio platform received significant expansions in October 2025, introducing proprietary AI model customization through Adobe Firefly Foundry. The platform integrated with major advertising systems including Amazon Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Innovid, LinkedIn, and TikTok.

Emotional connection through intentional craft

Adobe's second trend focuses on deliberately crafting moments that evoke shared human emotions. The approach, termed ""Connectioneering"" in the report, emphasizes authentic emotional resonance over promotional messaging.

Mills explained the fundamental motivation in the report. ""People really want to feel what connects us all to the special, valuable things that make us human,"" she stated.

Gallup research cited in Adobe's document indicated 95% of consumer decisions stem from emotional factors. Greenbook research found 70% of purchase decisions are shaped by an average of ten emotional needs.

The implementation requires setting up moments bridging regions and industries through universal emotional takeaways. Video content particularly benefits from music selection that captures and amplifies the intended mood. Every element reinforces the core spirit of the work.

The approach contrasts with purely informational advertising. Viewers stop noticing branding elements and instead experience the message directly through emotional engagement with shared joy, inspiration, or connection.

Research from multiple advertising studies throughout 2025 demonstrated consumer preferences for personalized content addressing emotional needs. Adobe's May 2025 study of over 1,000 Americans revealed specific preferences for brand engagement frequency and content personalization.

Surreal and playful design execution

Adobe's third trend encourages deliberately strange, humorous visual approaches that intrigue and entertain audiences. The surreal design strategy leverages generative AI capabilities to create imagery that stretches logic and bends physics.

VICE research cited in the report showed 68% of global youth actively search for humorous content providing escapism from reality.

Mills characterized the approach in the report. ""These are strange times, and if you can pivot and present strangeness in a humorous way, it's outrageously engaging and entertaining,"" she stated. ""It's an extremely clever approach I truly admire.""

Kantar research referenced in Adobe's forecast indicated brands described as fun and playful demonstrate significantly better performance in building future demand. Nutter Butter's TikTok series earned Social Campaign of the Year at the 2025 AdAge Creativity Awards by captivating Generation Z audiences through unexpected creative execution.

The technical enabler involves allowing generative AI tools like Adobe Firefly to operate without constraints forcing mimicry of existing visual conventions. Brands can discover entirely new aesthetic territories when AI systems imagine what doesn't currently exist rather than reproducing familiar patterns.

Industry research on creative trends throughout 2025 identified shifts toward dense, layered content particularly appealing to younger demographics. YouTube's September 2025 Culture & Trends report revealed ""Creative Maximalism"" as a dominant format incorporating multiple visual and audio information layers.

Local cultural authenticity

Adobe's fourth trend emphasizes partnering with local creators and spotlighting regional craftsmanship to achieve authentic representation. The approach positions locally rooted stories on global stages.

The trend emerges as Generation Z increasingly embraces ""appstinence""—conscious breaks from constant connectivity. This shift makes discovery of local cultures and communities more appealing than generic global content.

Mills explained the personalization aspect in the report. ""I work with a lot of enterprise customers for Adobe, and they're constantly asking for more authentic regional and local imagery so they can appeal to specific regions where their customers live,"" she stated. ""When people see themselves or their communities represented, it humanizes the company.""

Implementation requires stories belonging to communities rather than simply being about them. Collaboration with local talent both behind and in front of cameras becomes essential. Authentic cultural voices should remain unfiltered by translation or external interpretation.

Nike launched women's footwear in partnership with Delhi-based brand NorBlack NorWhite, according to CNN coverage cited in Adobe's report. The campaign used ancient tie-dyeing techniques and documented the work with Indian photographer Bharat Sikka.

Corona's ""Impossible Plants"" campaign in Japan addressed widespread vitamin D deficiency by encouraging sun exposure through imagery of plants sprouting through concrete, according to Muse by Clios coverage referenced in the forecast.

Visual discovery platforms like Pinterest introduced tools throughout 2025 enabling localized creative production. Pinterest announced AI-powered auto-collages in June 2025, transforming product catalogs into culturally relevant visual content.

AI's expanding role in creative production

The report positioned artificial intelligence as an enabler rather than replacement for human creativity. Tor Myhren, Vice President of Marketing Communications at Apple, stated in Adobe's forecast: ""While AI is the most exciting creative tool we have seen in our lifetime, the human touch is our superpower and the path to long-term brand love.""

Adobe emphasized commercially safe AI foundations trained on proprietary brand content. The approach addresses intellectual property concerns affecting some generative AI implementations.

Research from WPP Media in September 2025 found 71% of industry experts view AI-produced creative content as likely by 2030, with 29% considering it highly likely. The shift represents the largest positive movement from baseline measurements across any scenario examined.

Adobe's research cited in the trends report indicated 99% of Fortune 100 companies have used AI in Adobe applications. Nearly 90% of the company's top 50 enterprise accounts adopted AI-first innovations including GenStudio offerings.

Brands including The Coca-Cola Company, dentsu, The Estée Lauder Companies, Henkel, IBM, IPG Health, Lumen Technologies, Monks, The National Football League, Newell Brands, PepsiCo/Gatorade, Prudential Financial, Publicis Groupe, Qualcomm, Stagwell, and Tapestry have implemented Adobe's AI-powered systems, according to the report.

Adobe research indicated 62% of marketers surveyed experienced increased content production volume during the past year. Nearly two-thirds believe content demand will grow by at least five times between now and 2026.

Implementation considerations for marketing teams

Adobe's forecast provided practical guidance for applying each trend. The multisensory approach requires customizing brand colors, fonts, and textures while incorporating audio elements that complement visual content.

Emotional connection execution involves using collaborative AI-powered moodboards to spark new ideas within teams. Quick design tools can transform rough concepts into polished deliverables within minutes.

Surreal design implementation leverages diverse ecosystems of Adobe Firefly and partner models, providing choice and flexibility. Advertisers can maintain brand consistency while exploring imaginative creative territories through customized look-and-feel kits.

Local authenticity requires content localization to accommodate language and visual preferences regionally. Template customization enables adaptation while preserving core brand identity.

The report emphasized that successful implementation requires understanding authentic local voices rather than imposing external interpretations. When brands cannot physically access specific locations, collaboration with local talent becomes essential.

Marketing technology developments throughout 2025 demonstrated AI's transformation of customer engagement. Smartly's November 2025 research showed 92% of surveyed marketers reporting AI fundamentally redefines consumer connections.

Industry context and competitive landscape

Adobe's trends report arrives during significant advertising industry transformation. Global advertising spending reached $1.14 trillion in 2025, with commerce advertising surpassing television for the first time at $178.2 billion, according to WPP Media projections.

The creative production challenge intensifies as platforms demand increasing content variations. Facebook's advertising algorithms require minimum ten versions of ad images to optimize performance for specific users, demonstrating the scale of creative variation needed.

Brazilian agency GALERIA.ag announced in July 2025 a partnership committing R$10 million to Adobe GenStudio implementation. Adobe data cited in that announcement indicated GenStudio optimization delivers up to 70% reduction in go-to-market time for campaigns while centralizing asset management.

Industry research on AI adoption revealed cautious optimism among media professionals. Integral Ad Science's December 2025 report showed 61% of surveyed media experts expressed excitement about AI developments while 53% simultaneously cited unsuitable adjacencies as a top 2026 challenge.

The convergence of increasing content demands with expanding AI capabilities creates both opportunities and challenges. Adobe positioned its trends forecast as guidance for navigating this complexity while maintaining authentic human creativity.

Platform consolidation continues reshaping competitive dynamics. Google's advertising innovations and Meta's AI optimization systems demonstrate major platforms' commitment to automated creative production and optimization capabilities.

Market implications for creative professionals

The four trends identified by Adobe reflect broader shifts in consumer expectations and technological capabilities. Each trend addresses specific audience needs while leveraging AI tools to achieve scale impossible through manual production alone.

The multisensory approach responds to screen fatigue and desire for richer experiences. Emotional connection addresses automation anxiety by emphasizing human-centered storytelling. Surreal design provides entertainment value in attention-saturated environments. Local authenticity counters homogenization by celebrating cultural specificity.

Implementation requires balancing efficiency gains from AI automation with authentic human creativity that builds long-term brand relationships. The report emphasized that tools enable rather than replace creative talent.

Adobe provided curated collections, AI-powered moodboards, and customizable templates supporting each trend. These resources aim to accelerate adoption while maintaining creative quality standards.

The forecast aligns with broader industry predictions for 2026, which identified agentic AI, privacy-first identity infrastructure, and owned channel transformation as dominant themes reshaping marketing operations.

NewsNation's implementation of Adobe Express demonstrated practical applications of creative automation. The broadcaster reduced production time from hours to minutes using Adobe's tools, according to case study materials referenced in the trends report.

The creative trends forecast positions 2026 as a year where innovation and authenticity coexist rather than compete. Adobe emphasized that successful execution requires understanding both technological capabilities and enduring human creative principles.

The high three-year median payout ratio of 87% (that is, the company retains only 13% of its income) over the past three years for Medtronic suggests that the company's earnings growth was lower as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.

In addition, Medtronic has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 47% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 16% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.

Summary

Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Medtronic.

We recently published 10 Firms in the Limelight. Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) is one of the best performers on Friday.

Rocket Lab rallied for a second day on Friday, surging 17.69 percent to close at $70.52 apiece after bagging a potential billion-dollar contract to develop and produce satellites for the US Space Development Agency.

Touted as its largest single contract to date, Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) said that the partnership includes an $806 million base contract, $10.45 million in options, and opportunities for the supply of other items.

Under the base contract, Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) would manufacture 18 satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems.

Each satellite will feature its Phoenix infrared sensor payload, a wide field-of-view (WFOV) solution designed to meet the evolving missile defense needs of national security space, as well as advanced StarLite space protection sensors, designed to safeguard the constellation against directed energy threats.

Meanwhile, it would also supply items such as payloads, solar solutions, attitude determination and control components (ACDS), software, among others.

The contract forms part of the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 (TRKT3) program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA).

“Demand for resilient, scalable, and affordable space systems continues to grow, and this award demonstrates that Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in delivering solutions that meet the needs of national security,” said Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) CEO Peter Beck.

The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again.
Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace.
Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired.
Advt As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder.","Zara has quietly joined the growing list of fashion brands experimenting with artificial intelligence, and it’s already stirring conversation. The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again. The goal is pretty straightforward: faster visuals, fewer shoots, and quicker rollouts. But it also signals a bigger change in how fashion imagery is being made.

Zara isn’t alone in this. Earlier this year, H&M revealed it had created AI-generated versions of models for its marketing work, and Zalando has been using similar tools to speed up campaign production. Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace.

Advt

Zara’s parent company, Inditex, has been quick to clarify that AI isn’t here to replace humans. “We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” a company spokesperson said. They added that models are kept in the loop, their consent is taken before any AI edits are made, and payments follow industry standards.

The details first came out through a report by London-based outlet CityAM. According to the report, a model said Zara asked for approval before using AI to digitally show them wearing different outfits. The model also shared that they were paid the same amount they would have earned if they had travelled for another shoot, which suggests brands are trying to tread carefully, at least for now.

H&M and Zalando have made similar statements, saying AI is meant to support creative teams, not replace them. Photographers, stylists, makeup artists, and production crews are still part of the process, even if technology helps brands work faster and cut costs behind the scenes.

What makes Zara’s move especially interesting is that Inditex chair Marta Ortega is known to be a big supporter of fashion photography. The daughter of Zara founder Amancio Ortega has often spoken about her love for the art form. Since 2021, her MOP Foundation gallery in A Coruña, the Spanish city where Zara began, has hosted exhibitions celebrating legendary photographers.

Advt

Right now, the gallery is showing Annie Leibovitz’s work, and previous exhibitions have highlighted names like Steven Meisel, a long-time Zara collaborator, and Helmut Newton. At the same time, Ortega has been pushing Zara towards a more premium feel, shutting down smaller stores and focusing on larger, more polished flagship spaces.

Still, not everyone is convinced this AI shift is harmless. Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired. Her concern is that this won’t just affect big names in the industry, but also young creatives trying to get their first break.

Advt

As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder. And for now, the industry is still figuring out where exactly the line should be drawn.

Whether the plan requires a veto, in Johnson’s eyes, is the question of the hour.
Should Johnson follow through, he would be the first Chicago mayor to veto a budget plan since 1985, when Mayor Harold Washington rejected a revenue package approved by a majority bloc of aldermen.
And Johnson meanwhile introduced a revised budget plan of his own Friday that would replace the debt sale plan with the head tax.
But some holdouts are also reluctant to approve Johnson’s borrowing plan to cover firefighter backpay and police misconduct settlement costs.","The budget counterproposal crafted by opponents of Mayor Brandon Johnson won a critical first full City Council vote Friday, setting up the mayor to soon concede their remarkable weekslong fight — or issue Chicago’s first mayoral veto of a budget in decades.

Aldermen voted 29-19 to approve the revenue piece of an alternative 2026 spending plan that does not include Johnson’s corporate head tax. That’s shy of the 34-vote threshold needed to override a potential mayoral veto, however, leaving the door open for the City Hall standoff to escalate further still. And with under two weeks until an end-of-year deadline to approve a budget, all factions agree Chicago is inching too close for comfort to a government shutdown.

When the moment came Friday, aldermen debated for mere moments before quickly passing the plan.

“The city of Chicago’s financial position is at a critical juncture,” said Ald. Pat Dowell, Johnson’s handpicked Finance chair who played a critical role in the effort that outmuscled him. “And I think we have emerged today with a budget plan that protects programs which are vital to those most in need while setting on the right path toward a stronger fiscal future.”

The $16.6 billion aldermanic package contains a debt sale measure that Johnson has called Thursday “morally bankrupt” and his “red line.” His budget team warned such a novel proposal should not be counted on to raise any money at all, on top of attacking other components of the alternative budget that they argue is unbalanced and would require midyear amendments next year.

Whether the plan requires a veto, in Johnson’s eyes, is the question of the hour.

The rest of the budget package could face a vote as soon as Saturday. But in his post-council presser, the mayor sought to pump the brakes by insisting “negotiations are still prevalent. This process is not over just yet.”

“I haven’t made that decision yet,” Johnson said about a possible veto.

Johnson adviser Kennedy Bartley told reporters after the news conference that the administration believes the mayor would be able to make line item vetoes in key budget legislation, a sign he is weighing such a possibility.

Should Johnson follow through, he would be the first Chicago mayor to veto a budget plan since 1985, when Mayor Harold Washington rejected a revenue package approved by a majority bloc of aldermen. Johnson first threatened a mayoral veto last month on any budget that hikes property taxes or garbage fees but has been less committal about his council rivals’ current plan.

But he also took pains in his news conference Friday to try to frame the revenue package aldermen passed as a compromise, despite the fact the council has so far rejected his key corporate head tax provision and instead embraced the debt sale he has railed against.

He pointed to the increased and new taxes on leased personal property and social media companies to argue the passed plan pulls from businesses.

The mayor has also taken credit for his aldermanic opponents backing off a plan to increase garbage fees.“These are gains that, had we not put forth this fight, they would not exist,” he said.

And Johnson meanwhile introduced a revised budget plan of his own Friday that would replace the debt sale plan with the head tax. In the plan, the city would make a full advance pension payment Johnson had earlier proposed halving, not legalize video gambling terminals and count on slot machines being placed at a Midway Airport lounge.

Aldermen opposed to Johnson used a legislative maneuver to delay consideration of the mayor’s tweaked proposal.

Johnson’s head tax idea remains at a monthly $33-per-employee surcharge for companies over 500 workers in his latest ordinance, even after a majority of aldermen have repeatedly rejected versions of the levy in votes and letters. But the mayor on Friday refused to move on, comparing his fight to tax corporations to crusades for racial justice, gender equality and suffrage movements throughout American history.

“That fight is not over. Do you know how many times people fought for civil rights, women’s rights, the rights to vote?” Johnson said when asked why he won’t accept defeat. “Wouldn’t that have been a shame if we would have had that same question for people a generation ago? That you’ve lost it, why not give up?”

The mayor and his leftist allies have been admonishing the majority council bloc for weeks, say they are siding with rich corporations and billionaires. The war of words has also stood out from other budget fights in its campaign-style messaging from outside interests, pitting wealthy business-backed groups against the Johnson-allied Chicago Teachers Union and other progressive organizations.

But even the progressives were not united with Johnson, who first introduced his own $16.6 billion package in October but failed to make the case that his pitch to reinstate the city’s head tax, among other new revenue measures, was Chicago’s best hope to stand up to President Donald Trump. That his aldermanic rivals gained such ground over Johnson was not just because of his focus on the head tax but because they championed a full advance pension payment from the start.

That’s a requirement for many council members who say Chicago must stop kicking the can down the road with its fiscal obligations — or else risk a catastrophic credit downgrade. But some holdouts are also reluctant to approve Johnson’s borrowing plan to cover firefighter backpay and police misconduct settlement costs. The council counterproposal preserves that part of Johnson’s budget.

On Friday, Progressive Caucus members Aldermen Desmon Yancy, Ronnie Mosley and Ruth Cruz voted with the mayor’s opposition, while Ald. Andre Vasquez abstained. He later said on the floor he would have voted no but encountered technical difficulties.

Though progressive Ald. Matt Martin voted against the rival revenue package, he stressed that was because he wants to leverage both sides to nix the borrowing plan to pay for firefighter backpay and police settlements. Like his colleagues, he agreed a government shutdown “is the worst outcome, and that’s not going to happen.”

Asked if relations between the mayor’s office on the fifth floor and City Council had any hope of improving given that doomsday scenario, he took a long pause before saying, “I don’t know, honestly. I don’t know.”

Yancy, meanwhile, answered, “I guess the question is ‘Better than what?’ Right? The last couple of years has been really difficult. I think that has shown up in the way this budget conversation has gone.”

For his part Ald. Jason Ervin, Johnson’s pick to lead the powerful Budget Committee, argued afterward the vote did not signify an end to negotiations.

“I think that once the temperature dies down, folks go home for Christmas, take their pictures in their onesies and come back, I think we have a better result,” he said.

Asked if he believes the mayor should reject the spending plan he has criticized as unbalanced, he said “there are elements of it that should be vetoed.”

Outside chambers, Johnson’s empowered foes took a muted victory lap, with Ald. Brendan Reilly claiming the coalition was “awfully close” to winning over a veto-proof bloc of the council.

Dowell said that discussions should continue, as “a budget is a living document. It is a document that can be changed and modified, and if there are opportunities to do that or need to do that, we will.” She and her colleagues also disagreed with the mayor’s harsh rhetoric of that document.

“I don’t know what ‘morally bankrupt’ means,” Dowell said about Johnson’s ongoing criticism of their debt sale idea. “If you can explain that to me, I’ll answer the question.”

That Johnson’s third budget fight has gotten this combative shows how much the freshman mayor has lost control of the City Council. But Johnson himself may have inadvertently seen this coming months ago.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-l-city-council-budget-1.jpg?w=1024&h=664,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:25.715226

Фінальна мораль банальна і сто разів пережована: багатим теж несолодко, гроші руйнують їхній звʼязок з реальністю і з близькими.","Скандал, що лежить в основі подій фільму, свого часу прогримів на всю Європу. Головна акціонерка косметичної мегакорпорації L'Oréal Ліліан Беттанкур, чиї статки сягали майже 40 млрд доларів США, дійсно була найбагатшою жінкою світу. У 1987 році Беттанкур познайомилася з письменником, художником, світлиняром, відкритим ґеєм Франсуа-Марі Баньє, коли він фотографував її для французького журналу Égoiste. Вони стали дуже близькими друзями, по суті, платонічними коханцями — разом виходили у світ, розважались, подорожували.

Ліліан засипала Франсуа-Марі дуже коштовними подарунками (картини Пікассо, Матісса, Мондріана, Делоне і Леже, поліс страхування життя на суму € 253 млн — сума витрат склала € 1,3 млрд), навіть хотіла всиновити його. Дочка Ліліан, Франсуаза, яку вже давно непокоїв цей звʼязок, у 2007 році подала позов проти Баньє, звинувативши його в експлуатації фізичної або психологічної слабкості з метою особистої вигоди. Після розслідування і допитів справу передали до суду. Баньє засудили до двох з половиною років позбавлення волі та зобов'язали виплатити Ліліан 158 мільйонів євро як відшкодування збитків. Франсуа подав апеляцію. Другий судовий розгляд підтвердив вирок, але зупинив виконання тюремного ув'язнення та скасував відшкодування.

Режисер Тьєррі Кліф і його співсценаристи Седрік Анжер і Жак Фієскі змінили імена, але не обставини. Ліліан Беттанкур стала Маріанною Фаррер (Ізабель Юппер), Франсуа-Марі — П'єром-Аленом (Лоран Лафітт), Франсуаза — Фредерікою (Марина Фуа). Пролог тривожний: поліція проводить обшук у маєтку Фаррер, П'єра-Алена затримано, господиня спантеличена. Після цього режисер відступає в часі, аби показати, як поважна бізнес-леді дійшла до такого життя.

Цікаво, що на Netflix позаторік вийшов документальний мінісеріал про справу Беттанкур: «Мільярдерка, дворецький і бойфренд» (The Billionaire, the Butler and the Boyfriend). У ньому частину сцен проілюстровано ігровими реконструкціями за участю акторів. Тьєррі Кліф діє симетрично: вставляє в сюжет стилізовані під документальну зйомку інтервʼю з головними дійовими особами, що пригадують, як усе було. Щоправда, драматургічно це нічим не обумовлено: ЗМІ, медіа чи якась документалістська група в сюжеті не представлені. Здається, що режисер зробив ці «інтерв’ю», просто щоб переказати ті частини сюжету, які не вмістилися в основну історію. Загалом це, мабуть, головна біда фільму: в ньому багато слів, чимало персонажів, але повідомляє він недостатньо.

Юппер грає звичний для неї типаж жорсткої, уїдливої, зарозумілої героїні. Лоран Лафітт блискуче відпрацьовує таку собі комбінацію Тартюфа і Трумена Капоте, як його побачив Гас Ван Сент у серіалі «Капоте проти лебедів» (2024). Його П'єр-Ален — веселий цинік, зухвалий трикстер, чарівний у своєму нахабстві, артистично-безцеремонний. Його гасло — «Сміливим бути краще». Він вміло комбінує маскулінний натиск і жіночну кокетливість. Лафітт з Юппер створюють яскраву хімію між персонажами, і це, мабуть, найкраща частина фільму — єдина, правду кажучи, яка не викликає запитань.

А запитання є. Зрозуміло, чим П'єр-Ален приваблює Маріанну, але важливіше те, чому в неї взагалі виникла потреба в ньому. Що не так у її шлюбі? Чи надламав її тягар наступництва в бізнес-імперії? Чому вона настільки холодна і відсторонена з дочкою? Яку роль у цьому всьому зіграли пронацистські симпатії її батька, якого вона обожнювала? Відповіді, що визначають мотивації героїв, є у вищезазначеному серіалі Netflix, але не у фільмі.

І з цього випливає прикра драматична змазаність «Найбагатшої жінки світу». Юппер практично не змінюється, що б не відбувалося: на її обличчі не читається ані розгубленість, ані лють, ані умиротворення. Емоційні півтони заміщуються мелодраматичними прийомами (чого лише варта сцена в нічному клубі, коли знайома П'єра-Алена співає сльозливий шансон). Фінальна мораль банальна і сто разів пережована: багатим теж несолодко, гроші руйнують їхній звʼязок з реальністю і з близькими.

Але нащо було заради такого набору очевидностей витрачати аж дві години екранного часу?",https://i.lb.ua/119/53/694514e970bb9.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 11:03:07.070402

He died of old age complications at 10:35 am on Saturday, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). He was 95 years (Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un).

AK Khandker, deputy chief of staff of the Mukti Bahini during the Liberation War, was the first chief of the Bangladesh Air Force.

The former Air Vice Marshal later entered politics and served as a minister on two occasions.

AK Khandker was born in 1930 in Rangpur, where his father was posted for work.

His ancestral home was in Puran varenga village of Bera Upazila in Pabna District. He passed his matriculation examination in 1947 and his higher secondary examination in 1949.

In 1952, he was commissioned into the Pakistan Air Force. As a group captain, he joined the Bangladesh War of Liberation and was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Mukti Bahini.

Immediately prior to the Liberation War, he was the second-in-command of the Pakistan Air Force in East Pakistan.

He later left that position and joined the War of Liberation.

On 16 December 1971, at the historic moment of the surrender of the Pakistani forces at the Racecourse Ground in Dhaka, he was present as a representative of the Mukti Bahini.

After independence, he was appointed the first chief of the Bangladesh Air Force and under his leadership the war-ravaged Air Force was reorganised and rebuilt. He served as Air Force chief until 1975.

In recognition of his outstanding contributions to Bangladesh’s War of Liberation, AK Khandker was awarded the gallantry title of Bir Uttam in 1973 and the Independence Award in 2011. He also served as president of the Sector Commanders’ Forum.

AK Khandker first served as a minister in the government of HM Ershad. Later, after being elected a member of parliament from the Awami League in 2008, he again held ministerial office.

The Coastguard initiated the Anstruther RNLI pagers at 9.48pm and requested the launch of the Anster lifeboat.
The large fishing vessel was continuing to take on water and there was significant concern that the boat could sink, with an estimated 2000 litres of fuel onboard.
The Anstruther RNLI crew were able to leave the incident by 1.15am and were back in Anstruther Harbour by 1.35am.

The Coastguard initiated the Anstruther RNLI pagers at 9.48pm and requested the launch of the Anster lifeboat.

However, at the time of the initial request there was no reported or assumed risk to life. Therefore, in accordance with RNLI policy, the Anstruther RNLI Duty Launch Authority declined the request and did not provide authority for the lifeboat to launch, as there was no risk to life.

The large fishing vessel was continuing to take on water and there was significant concern that the boat could sink, with an estimated 2000 litres of fuel onboard.

Further information was received from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service teams from Anstruther and St. Monans, who were in attendance at the scene, that a member of the public had boarded the sinking vessel in an attempt to shore up the cause of the leak, which now constituted a potential risk to life. Furthermore, the Scottish Fire and Rescue service were not equipped to board the vessel safely to rescue a casualty.

At 10.15pm the Coastguard again requested the launch of the Anstruther RNLI all-weather lifeboat and the Anster volunteer crew were able to launch immediately, as they had already assembled and were kitted out, prepped and briefed for an immediate launch to the incident.

By 10.27pm the Anster Shannon, with its volunteer crew of six aboard, were in the water and heading out in a rough sea, against a Force 6, South Westerly wind. The Anstruther RNLI lifeboat crew arrived on the scene at 10.43pm and liaised with both the Scottish Fire and Rescue Teams and the Coastguard Rescue Teams from St. Andrews and Leven, who had initiated a cordon around the harbour area.

It was established that the member of the public who had boarded the vessel had voluntarily disembarked safely from the sinking vessel and was now being supported by the emergency services in attendance.

There was no longer a risk to life, but the combined rescue teams in attendance were still faced with the prospect of a large fishing vessel taking on water, with 2000 litres of fuel onboard, which could have created an environmental spill if the fuel tanks flooded. It was jointly assessed by the RNLI Anstruther Coxswain, Michael Bruce, and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service that the Anstruther RNLI volunteer crew would board the vessel and use their combined pumps to keep the vessel afloat and attempt to shore up the cause of the leak to prevent the fishing boat sinking.

By 12.32am the fishing vessel had been emptied of water, with the leak temporarily plugged and it was assessed as being made safe for a later inspection and repair. The Anstruther RNLI crew were able to leave the incident by 1.15am and were back in Anstruther Harbour by 1.35am.

However, due to the state of the tides it was not possible to conduct a high-water recovery of the all-weather lifeboat, so the lifeboat was moored up on the pier. The tides enabled the lifeboat to be recovered and rehoused by 3am; however, when considering the work commitments of the volunteer boat and shore crew it was decided to leave the Anstruther Shannon afloat, but still on stand-by, until a planned recovery and rehouse at 8am.

Michael Bruce, Coxswain for Anstruther’s RNLI Lifeboat, said: ‘Fortunately, the member of the public who boarded the unsafe fishing vessel managed to get themselves to safety, without the incident developing into a rescue, or worse.

‘The RNLI will always launch and respond where there is a potential risk to life, but we urge members of the public to not place themselves at risk, despite how well intentioned they are, but to leave incidents like this to the Emergency Services, who will seek support from the RNLI if the situation warrants our involvement.

‘If you are intending to spend the festive period on, or near the water, please enjoy yourselves safely, but make sure you take notice of published tide times, the weather forecast and any warning and information signs at the location.

‘The RNLI, alongside our colleagues in the Emergency Services will remain on standby 24/7 throughout the Festive and Hogmanay period in support of our local coastal community and visitors.’

Strategic Push: Confluent Acquisition Bolsters AI Ambitions IBM's strategic direction continues to emphasize the expansion of its AI and data platforms.","A fresh analyst downgrade is applying pressure to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) shares, shifting investor focus squarely onto valuation concerns. This comes despite the technology giant reporting robust quarterly results and aggressively advancing its artificial intelligence strategy through multi-billion dollar acquisitions.

The company's strong operational foundation was highlighted in its third-quarter 2025 report, where it surpassed market expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) reached $2.65, outperforming the consensus forecast of $2.45. Revenue totaled $16.33 billion, exceeding estimates of $16.10 billion and representing a year-over-year growth rate of 9.1%. A key metric, IBM's AI-related ""book of business,"" now stands at over $9.5 billion.

Bolstered by this performance, management raised its full-year outlook. The company now targets constant-currency revenue growth exceeding 5% and has increased its projected free cash flow to approximately $14 billion.

Downgrade Highlights Valuation Skepticism

Against this backdrop of operational strength, Wall Street Zen revised its rating on IBM shares from ""Buy"" to ""Hold"" on December 20, 2025. The firm cited increasing skepticism regarding the stock's valuation and its future growth trajectory. This move underscores a growing debate on Wall Street about whether the company's current share price already reflects its positive momentum.

The overall analyst consensus remains favorable but is not unanimous. The average rating stands at ""Moderate Buy,"" with a mean price target of $293.38. The distribution of recommendations reveals a mixed field:

* 1 ""Strong Buy""

* 9 ""Buy""

* 6 ""Hold""

* 1 ""Sell"" (UBS Group)

Diverging views are evident. Stifel maintained its ""Buy"" recommendation and raised its price target from $295 to $325 on December 9. In contrast, Sanford C. Bernstein reiterated a ""market perform"" rating on December 10. This spectrum of opinion suggests that while IBM's business execution is convincing, the entry point for new investors is becoming a more cautious consideration.

Premium Multiples Under Scrutiny

Valuation metrics are now a central focus. IBM currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.0 and a PEG ratio of 2.99. These multiples position the stock notably above the industry average for ""Computer-Integrated Systems,"" where the forward P/E ratio sits at 24.95.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

This premium is the core reason for the emerging analyst hesitation. A sustained higher valuation multiple requires correspondingly accelerated growth to justify it. The recent downgrade reflects a concern that the stock may have already priced in much of the company's recent positive news.

Market reaction has been measured so far. Shares closed at 257.85 euros on Friday, representing a solid year-to-date gain of over 20%. However, this price remains roughly 5% below the stock's 52-week high.

Strategic Push: Confluent Acquisition Bolsters AI Ambitions

IBM's strategic direction continues to emphasize the expansion of its AI and data platforms. On December 8, the company announced a major move in this arena: the acquisition of Confluent for approximately $11 billion. The goal is to construct an enterprise-grade ""Smart Data Platform"" tailored for generative AI applications.

This purchase aims to solidify IBM's standing in the competitive and investment-heavy AI infrastructure market. It follows a series of other AI initiatives, including partnerships with Anthropic and Grok, designed to enhance the capabilities of the Watson-X platform.

For shareholders, the message is clear: IBM is willing to commit significant capital to build out its AI ecosystem. While this is intended to drive long-term growth, it also intensifies short-term questions about valuation and integration.

Conclusion: Robust Story Meets Price Sensitivity

In summary, IBM operates from a position of fundamental strength, evidenced by its Q3 beat, raised guidance, and a clearly articulated AI strategy punctuated by the major Confluent deal. Nevertheless, the spotlight has turned to the stock's price.

The sustainability of its current elevated valuation will largely depend on IBM's ability to deliver on its higher growth targets within the AI segment and for total revenue in coming quarters. Investors will also be watching closely for tangible synergies to emerge from the integration of Confluent.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2411716_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 07:59:29.103786

The company said on Friday that it will train 5 million learners in the country by 2030 in frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and quantum computing. The initiative is part of its plan to build a future-ready workforce and expand access to digital skills.

The skilling effort will be delivered through IBM’s ‘SkillsBuild’ programme. The company said the aim is to support both students and adult learners with training that matches the demands of emerging industries.

The focus will be on employability and developing practical skills that help people enter the technology workforce.

AI, QUANTUM AND CYBERSECURITY TRAINING TO SHAPE INDIA'S NEXT TECH WORKFORCE

IBM said it will expand its education outreach across schools, colleges and vocational institutions. A key part of the initiative is a collaboration with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

Through this partnership, IBM plans to introduce hands-on learning pathways in AI and other technologies. It will also offer faculty training programmes, hackathons and internship opportunities.

The company’s target for India is part of a wider global mission. IBM aims to train 30 million people worldwide by 2030. The India programme will form one of the largest national components of that goal.

Education experts say the need for such skilling programmes has increased as companies demand workers who understand AI systems, data models, security tools and automation.

India’s rapid digital expansion has further pushed the need for a trained workforce that can adapt to changing technologies.

With this initiative, IBM joins a growing list of global technology companies investing in skilling programmes in India. The company said that by working with institutions and government bodies, it hopes to reach learners across different regions and economic backgrounds.

The IBM SkillsBuild programme already has a presence in several Indian states.

The expanded plan will cover more campuses and community-level centres, allowing learners to access free courses, certifications and project-based modules.

As India looks to strengthen its digital economy, the coming years will test how effectively such mass skilling efforts can translate into job opportunities and industry-ready talent. IBM’s long-term target signals a belief that the next wave of technological leadership will depend on how well countries prepare their workforce today.

I wish I could say I was surprised by DOGE — which for me was the full culmination of the long-simmering libertarian basis of the Silicon Valley worldview being enacted at scale by the federal government.","A tech worker turned art critic, Mike Pepi has carefully chronicled how Silicon Valley’s true evolution since the dot-com era has been defined not by the development of new digital tools, but rather by a fundamental rethinking about how society should be structured. His latest book, Against Platforms: Surviving Digital Utopia, traces the downfall of the egalitarian ideals from the earliest days of the internet. Pepi talks to us about his proposal for a Slop Tax, and why the pursuit of artificial general intelligence is doomed. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What’s one underrated big idea?

That nothing is inevitable. I’m starting to see this more in the critique of Silicon Valley and their deployment of technology. “Technology” itself, as a standalone term, is a misnomer. It’s always about its design and deployment by people, and people are political animals: they use institutions and have and cede power. The Silicon Valley techno-determinists want you to think that “technology” is on an inevitable march, but this is just a total fiction unraveling before our eyes.

DIGITAL FUTURE DAILY readers: We want to hear from you! What do you like in your afternoon tech newsletter? What do you want more of? Please take a few minutes and fill out this survey.

What’s a technology you think is overhyped?

AGI, and to a larger extent AI in general. Not only is it simply statistically likely output — math that basically just guesses at response — the implementations of it are coming back down to reality. In the office, it’s sowing chaos and most AI projects blow up, and in terms of its “creative applications,” we’re seeing mostly slop produced by some of the least interesting people on earth.

In 10 years’ time, we’ll look back on AI as an extremely overhyped homework help tool. As for AGI, where do we start? Even the most frontier models continually hallucinate, and worse, they lack context about tasks that only humans can provide. AGI is basically religion for a very small minority of people; on the other hand, it’s a myth manufactured by Silicon Valley to rationalize increased investment and to stoke fear into anyone who seems semi-critical of the increasing encroachment of AI in everyday life.

What could the government be doing regarding technology that it isn’t?

Taxing AI companies and platforms that produce and host AI slop, and redistribute that money to sustain the institutions and creators that AI has stolen from. I call it the Slop Tax and I’ve drafted a whitepaper to advocate for this policy. We are looking for groups to pilot this with.

What book most shaped your conception of the future?

Imaginary Futures: From Thinking Machines to the Global Village by Richard Barbrook. Not only does this book provide a handy history of digital utopianism, [but] the thing that struck me most about [it] is just how often the history of 20th-century technology involves its boosters describing the potential benefits of a tool far before that capability is a reality. Then, once the tech arrives, the utopian ground has already been seeded, and a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy takes hold.

What has surprised you the most this year?

I wish I could say I was surprised by DOGE — which for me was the full culmination of the long-simmering libertarian basis of the Silicon Valley worldview being enacted at scale by the federal government. I could not have predicted, however, the brazenness. The way that [Elon] Musk sold this was also concerning, as it tapped into the very American strain of small-government ideology, though this time with a heavy layer of a vague AI-inflected anti-humanism.

I take heart that the entire thing failed, and that it led to a kind of counter-revolution in which everyday citizens now realize the full extent to which so many government institutions and federal funds ensure our most basic necessities.

Democrats go hard on Instacart

Democratic senators want the Federal Trade Commission to exert pressure on Instacart.

Seven senators sent a letter to FTC Andrew Ferguson, which was first shared with POLITICO’s Morning Tech team, urging him to launch an investigation into its alleged use of dynamic pricing — the practice of continuously changing prices based on fluctuations in demand or the time of day.

The senators cite a report by the Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports and More Perfect Union suggesting that Instacart has experimented with using AI to determine food prices. As the letter, helmed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), reads: “We are deeply concerned that Instacart’s pricing tactics may result in higher food prices, less competition, fewer opportunities to comparison shop, more incentive for companies to collect sensitive personal data, and increased customer confusion[.]”

Another stab at national privacy rules

Republican House members are gearing up to introduce data privacy legislation as early as January, POLITICO’s Gabby Miller was the first to report.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is putting the final touches on a law that would protect consumers’ data. If passed, the law would likely preempt state statutes on data protection, and finally end Congress’s protracted quest to establish a national privacy framework.

“There’s a consensus standard composed of, I would say, the majority of the states that would try to kind of conglomerate them all together,” Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.), a member of the the committee’s all-Republican data privacy working group, told Gabby. “I think people aren’t going to be surprised, it’s a lot of ideas that have been tried successfully elsewhere, which the states are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy.”

But a user under the name @Kakashii posted on X December 7 disputing the claims, a thread Burry chose to amplify and double down on.

Claims of Inconsistent Numbers

Kakashii explained the calculations he performed to confirm Huang’s statements.

“Since Blackwell is out, Nvidia reported 111B in revenue in GPU datacenters,” he wrote. “If you do simple math, 6 million Blackwell GPUs within the reported 111B revenue of datacenters since Blackwell started to ship is not matching, because it represents only between 2.5 to 3.5 million Blackwell chips.”

Even when giving Huang the benefit of the doubt and assuming he is “always telling the truth,” @Kakashii said, the numbers track for just four million units. He claims millions are unaccounted for.

He concluded that the claim is inconsistent with Nvidia’s reported revenue and with data center power capacity. So, the question would be that if a large portion of Nvidia Blackwell GPUs aren’t being used in data centers, as the thread claims, where are they?

Nvidia’s announcement with Nokia mostly focused on using GPUs at the base of wireless towers to run both radio access network (or, RAN) applications alongside AI workloads. But while Nvidia seems eager to tap into this new market, there are a few problems.

First, there are a ton of questions about whether the use case Nvidia is targeting even requires GPUs. And second? AI-RAN isn’t just one thing. And plenty of AI-RAN workloads are running today on existing hardware – that is, on CPUs.

It’s a bit complicated, but with a player as big as Nvidia shining a spotlight on the topic, it’s worth taking a deep dive to really understand what’s happening in this space.

With help from Orange’s Director of Innovation in Radio & Environment Atoosa Hatefi and Dell’Oro Group’s Stefan Pongratz we’ll dig into the different flavors of AI-RAN, what would compel telecom operators to spring for GPUs and what the overall market forecast looks like.

Speaking in a recently released episode of ""On with Kara Swisher"" podcast, Khosrowshahi said that while tech CEOs might see AI making their engineers less productive, he has a different point of view. ""I just think they become superhumans,"" he said. ""So we are actually hiring more engineers because every engineer got more valuable to me,"" he added. Khosrowshahi further revealed that around 80% to 90% of Uber's developers now use AI tools. This, he said, has done away with the need to keep scores of engineers on call to fix issues, and have them spend ""hours and hours"" figuring out what's gone wrong and where. Instead, AI agents are ""constantly looking at all of our systems"" and helping to diagnose problems, he said. ""And then the human can look over the shoulder of the AI agent,"" Khosrowshahi added. Describing his mobility, delivery, and freight company as an ""applied AI"" business, Khosrowshahi said that Uber is harnessing the tech for everything – from setting prices and payments to matching, routing, identification, and dealing with customer complaints.

During the podcast, Khosrowshahi also touched upon topics such as the AI bubble. He said that while AI stocks may look frothy, but Uber's embrace of the technology is transforming its operations and yielding huge financial benefits. “You can debate whether or not there's a bubble in terms of valuation,” he said adding “The spending on the data centers, etc., is massive.” Khosrowshahi also revealed that the AI has created a lot of value for Uber, ""not in the space-age stuff"" but in ""very practical"" ways. He also gave examples of the practical usage of AI for Uber which included “determining what's shown next to a customer on their Uber Eats app after they select a carton of oat milk. ” He said that the latest AI models are ""enormously more effective"" than previous ones, and are producing ""hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit to us"". Uber's AI spend ""has been well worth it and then some,"" he said. ""We are not building the picks and shovels but we're riding on top of that spend, absolutely.”

$5,000,000 Barclays Bank PLC Trigger Callable Yield Notes

Linked to the lesser performing of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index due March 22, 2027

Investment Description

The Trigger Callable Yield Notes (the “Notes”) are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations issued by Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuer”) linked to the lesser performing of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index (each an “Underlying” and together the “Underlyings”). On a monthly basis, unless the Notes have been previously called, the Issuer will pay you a coupon (the “Monthly Coupon”) on each Coupon Payment Date regardless of the performance of either Underlying. The Issuer may, at its election, call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Issuer elects to call the Notes prior to maturity, the Issuer will pay the principal amount of your Notes plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date, and no further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes. If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes prior to maturity and the Closing Level of each Underlying on the Final Valuation Date (the “Final Underlying Level”) is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you a cash payment at maturity equal to the principal amount of your Notes plus the final Monthly Coupon. However, if the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, at maturity, the Issuer will pay the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than the principal amount, if anything, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Underlying with the lower Underlying Return (the “Lesser Performing Underlying”). In this case, you will have full downside exposure to the Lesser Performing Underlying from its Initial Underlying Level to its Final Underlying Level, and could lose all of your principal. Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. You may lose a significant portion or all of your principal. You will be exposed to the market risk of each Underlying and any decline in the level of one Underlying may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the level of the other Underlying. The Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is observed relative to its Downside Threshold only on the Final Valuation Date, and the contingent repayment of principal applies only if you hold the Notes to maturity. Generally, the higher the Coupon Rate on a Note, the greater the risk of loss on that Note. Your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Monthly Coupons paid on the Notes until maturity or earlier call, and you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page PS-4 of this pricing supplement) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement and “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

NOTICE TO INVESTORS: THE NOTES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY RISKIER THAN CONVENTIONAL DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THE ISSUER IS NOT NECESSARILY OBLIGATED TO REPAY THE FULL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AT MATURITY, AND THE NOTES CAN HAVE THE FULL DOWNSIDE MARKET RISK OF THE LESSER PERFORMING UNDERLYING. THIS MARKET RISK IS IN ADDITION TO THE CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN PURCHASING A DEBT OBLIGATION OF BARCLAYS BANK PLC. YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE THE NOTES IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS INVOLVED IN INVESTING IN THE NOTES.

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER “KEY RISKS” BEGINNING ON PAGE PS-8 OF THIS PRICING SUPPLEMENT AND “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE S-9 OF THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT BEFORE PURCHASING ANY NOTES.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Notes

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Trade Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Trade Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Trade Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Trade Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Trade Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the Notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Key Risks” beginning on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement.

PS- 3

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

Selected Purchase Considerations

The considerations identified above are not exhaustive. Whether or not the Notes are an appropriate investment for you will depend on your individual circumstances, and you should reach an investment decision only after you and your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors have carefully considered the appropriateness of an investment in the Notes in light of your particular circumstances. You should also review carefully the “Key Risks” beginning on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement and the “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement for risks related to an investment in the Notes. For more information about the Underlyings, please see the sections titled “Russell 2000® Index” and “EURO STOXX 50® Index” below.

Final Terms1

Issuer: Barclays Bank PLC Principal Amount: $10 per Note (subject to minimum investment of 100 Notes) Term2: Approximately 1.25 years, unless called earlier at the election of the Issuer. See “Key Dates” on the cover of this pricing supplement.2 Reference Assets: The Russell 2000® Index (Bloomberg ticker symbol “RTY<Index>”) and the EURO STOXX 50® Index (Bloomberg ticker symbol “SX5E<Index>”) (each an “Underlying” and together the “Underlyings”) Issuer Call: The Issuer may elect to call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Notes are called, the Issuer will pay the principal amount of your Notes plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date, and no further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes. Optional Call Notice Dates: March 17, 2026, April 17, 2026, May 18, 2026, June 17, 2026, July 17, 2026, August 17, 2026, September 17, 2026, October 19, 2026, November 17, 2026, December 17, 2026, January 19, 2027 and February 17, 2027 Call Settlement Dates2: The Coupon Payment Date immediately following the applicable Optional Call Notice Date Monthly Coupon: The Monthly Coupon is a fixed amount payable monthly based on the per annum Coupon Rate, regardless of the performance of either Underlying, subject to an earlier call at the discretion of the Issuer. Coupon Rate: The Coupon Rate is 9.20% per annum. Accordingly, the Monthly Coupon payable on each Coupon Payment Date is equal to $0.0767 per Note. Coupon Payment Dates2: January 22, 2026, February 19, 2026, March 19, 2026, April 21, 2026, May 20, 2026, June 22, 2026, July 21, 2026, August 19, 2026, September 21, 2026, October 21, 2026, November 19, 2026, December 21, 2026, January 21, 2027, February 19, 2027 and the Maturity Date Payment at Maturity (per Note):

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you a cash payment on the Maturity Date equal to $10 per Note plus the final Monthly Coupon.

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, on the Maturity Date, the Issuer will pay you the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than your principal amount, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying. You will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date per Note, calculated as follows:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

Accordingly, you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity, depending on how much the Lesser Performing Underlying declines, regardless of the performance of the other Underlying. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party.

Underlying Return:

With respect to each Underlying:

Final Underlying Level – Initial Underlying Level

Initial Underlying Level

Lesser Performing Underlying: The Underlying with the lower Underlying Return Downside Threshold: With respect to each Underlying, a percentage of the Initial Underlying Level of that Underlying, as specified on the cover of this pricing supplement Initial Underlying Level: With respect to each Underlying, the Closing Level of that Underlying on the Trade Date, as specified on the cover of this pricing supplement Final Underlying Level: With respect to each Underlying, the Closing Level of that Underlying on the Final Valuation Date Closing Level: With respect to each Underlying, Closing Level has the meaning set forth under “Reference Assets—Indices—Special Calculation Provisions” in the prospectus supplement.

Investment Timeline

Trade Date: The Closing Level of each Underlying (the Initial Underlying Level) is observed and the Downside Threshold of each Underlying is determined. Monthly (callable by Issuer at its election beginning March 17, 2026):

The Issuer will pay you the applicable Monthly Coupon.

The Issuer may, at its election and upon written notice to the trustee, call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Issuer elects to call the Notes, the Issuer will pay the principal amount of your Notes plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date, and no further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes.

Maturity Date:

The Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is determined as of the Final Valuation Date.

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you a cash payment on the Maturity Date equal to $10 per Note plus the final Monthly Coupon.

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, on the Maturity Date, the Issuer will pay you the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than your principal amount, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying. You will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date per Note, calculated as follows:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

Accordingly, you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity, depending on how much the Lesser Performing Underlying declines, regardless of the performance of the other Underlying.

Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. You may lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount. You will be exposed to the market risk of each Underlying and any decline in the level of one Underlying may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the level of the other Underlying. The Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is observed relative to its Downside Threshold only on the Final Valuation Date, and the contingent repayment of principal applies only if you hold the Notes to maturity. Generally, the higher the Coupon Rate on a Note, the greater the risk of loss on that Note. Your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Monthly Coupons paid on the Notes until maturity or earlier call, and you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the Notes.

Key Risks

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in either or both Underlyings or the securities composing the Underlyings. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

¨You may lose a significant portion or all of your principal — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily pay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes, at maturity, the Issuer will pay you the principal amount of your Notes only if the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold and will make such payment only at maturity. If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, you will receive the final Monthly Coupon, but you will be exposed to the full decline in the Lesser Performing Underlying and the Issuer will repay less than the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity, if anything, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying. Accordingly, you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal.

¨Your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Monthly Coupons paid on the Notes until maturity or earlier call, and you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified per annum Coupon Rate, regardless of any appreciation of either Underlying. If the Notes are called at the election of the Issuer, you will not receive Monthly Coupons or any other payment after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Because the Notes could be called as early as approximately three months after the Trade Date, the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called, you may be subject to the decline in the level of the Lesser Performing Underlying even though you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying. As a result, the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in either or both Underlyings or the securities composing the Underlyings.

¨You are exposed to the market risk of each Underlying with respect to the payment at maturity, if any — Your return on the Notes (other than the Monthly Coupons) is not linked to a basket consisting of the Underlyings. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Underlying. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Underlying. Poor performance by either Underlying over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the level of the other Underlying. If the Notes have not been called prior to maturity and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Lesser Performing Underlying. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Underlying.

¨Because the Notes are linked to the Lesser Performing Underlying, you are exposed to greater risk of sustaining a significant loss of principal at maturity than if the Notes were linked to a single Underlying — The risk that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Underlying. With two Underlyings, it is more likely that the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying will be less than its Downside Threshold and, therefore, it is more likely that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. In addition, the performance of the Underlyings may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between two Underlyings, the greater the potential for one of those Underlyings to close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date. See “Correlation of the Underlyings” below.

It is impossible to predict what the correlation between the Underlyings will be over the term of the Notes. The Underlyings represent different equity markets. The Russell 2000® Index represents the small-capitalization segment of the United States equity market and the EURO STOXX 50® Index represents equity markets in the Eurozone. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes.

Although the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Coupon Rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Coupon Rate is generally associated with lower correlation of the Underlyings, which reflects a greater potential for a loss of principal at maturity. The correlation referenced in setting the terms of the Notes is calculated using our internal models and is not derived from the returns of the Underlyings over the period set forth under “Correlation of the Underlyings” below. In addition, other factors and inputs other than correlation may impact how the terms of the Notes are set and the performance of the Notes.

¨If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes, the payment at maturity, if any, is calculated based solely on the performance of the Lesser Performing Underlying — If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes pursuant to the Call Feature, the payment at maturity (other than the final Monthly Coupon), if any, will be linked solely to the performance of the Lesser Performing Underlying. As a result, in the event that the Final Underlying Level of the Lesser Performing Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, the Underlying Return of only the Lesser Performing Underlying will be used to determine the payment at maturity (other than the final Monthly Coupon) on your Notes, and you will not benefit from the performance of the other Underlying, even if the Final Underlying Level of the other Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold or Initial Underlying Level.

¨Call and reinvestment risk — The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Issuer elects to call the Notes early, the holding period over which you would receive the per annum Coupon Rate could be as short as approximately three months. In the event the Issuer calls the Notes, there is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds at a comparable return and/or with a comparable Coupon Rate for a similar level of risk.

It is more likely that the Issuer will call the Notes at its election prior to maturity to the extent that the Monthly Coupons payable on the Notes are greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by the Issuer of comparable maturity, terms and

PS- 8

credit rating trading in the market. The greater likelihood of the Issuer calling the Notes in that environment increases the risk that you will not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the called Notes in an equivalent investment with a similar Coupon Rate. The Issuer is less likely to call the Notes prior to maturity when the Monthly Coupons on the Notes are less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by the Issuer. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the Monthly Coupons on the Notes are less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments.

¨Any payment on the Notes (other than Monthly Coupons) will be determined based on the Closing Levels of the Underlyings on the dates specified — Any payment on the Notes (other than Monthly Coupons) will be determined based on the Closing Levels of the Underlyings on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Underlyings determined at any other time.

¨Contingent repayment of principal applies only at maturity or upon any call at the election of the Issuer — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any call at the election of the Issuer. The market value of the Notes may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the Final Valuation Date. If you are able to sell your Notes prior to maturity in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell them at a loss relative to your principal amount even if at that time the level of either or both Underlyings is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold.

¨A higher Coupon Rate and/or a lower Downside Threshold may reflect greater expected volatility of the Underlyings, which is generally associated with a greater risk of loss — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the levels of the Underlyings over a period of time. The greater the expected volatilities of the Underlyings at the time the terms of the Notes are set, the greater the expectation is at that time that you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity. In addition, the economic terms of the Notes, including the Coupon Rate and the Downside Threshold, are based, in part, on the expected volatilities of the Underlyings at the time the terms of the Notes are set, where higher expected volatilities will generally be reflected in a higher Coupon Rate than the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities of the same maturity and/or on otherwise comparable securities and/or a lower Downside Threshold as compared to otherwise comparable securities. Accordingly, a higher Coupon Rate will generally be indicative of a greater risk of loss while a lower Downside Threshold does not necessarily indicate that the Notes have a greater likelihood of returning your principal at maturity. You should be willing to accept the downside market risk of each Underlying and the potential loss of a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity.

¨Owning the Notes is not the same as owning the securities composing either or both Underlyings — The return on your Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the securities composing either or both Underlyings. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the securities composing either Underlying would have.

¨No assurance that the investment view implicit in the Notes will be successful — It is impossible to predict whether and the extent to which the level of either Underlying will rise or fall. There can be no assurance that the level of either Underlying will not close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date. The level of each Underlying will be influenced by complex and interrelated political, economic, financial and other factors that affect that Underlying. You should be willing to accept the downside risks associated with equities in general and each Underlying in particular, and the risk of losing a significant portion or all of your principal amount.

¨Tax treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “What Are the Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes?” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

¨Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

¨You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlyings

¨Each Underlying reflects the price return of the securities composing that Underlying, not the total return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Underlyings, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing each

PS- 9

Underlying. Each Underlying is not a “total return” index that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing the applicable Underlying. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

¨Adjustments to the Underlyings could adversely affect the value of the Notes — The sponsor of an Underlying may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Underlying or make other methodological changes to that Underlying that could affect its performance. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Level of an Underlying in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Underlying. In addition, the sponsor of an Underlying may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Underlying at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the discontinued Underlying or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Level of that Underlying. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the relevant Underlying and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

¨The Notes are subject to small-capitalization companies risk with respect to the Russell 2000® Index — The Russell 2000® Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the Russell 2000® Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

¨Non-U.S. securities markets risks with respect to the EURO STOXX 50® Index — The equity securities composing the EURO STOXX 50® Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

¨No direct exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro with respect to the EURO STOXX 50® Index — The EURO STOXX 50® Index is composed of non-U.S. securities denominated in euros. Because the level of the EURO STOXX 50® Index is also calculated in euros (and not in U.S. dollars), the performance of the EURO STOXX 50® Index will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. In addition, any payments on the Notes determined based in part on the performance of the EURO STOXX 50® Index will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from any appreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

¨We may accelerate the Notes if a change-in-law event occurs — Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or an Underlying or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

¨Dealer incentives — We, the Agents and affiliates of the Agents act in various capacities with respect to the Notes. The Agents and various affiliates may act as a principal, agent or dealer in connection with the Notes. We will not pay compensation to the Agents in connection with the distribution of the Notes.

¨Potentially inconsistent research, opinions or recommendations by Barclays Capital Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc. or their respective affiliates — Barclays Capital Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc. or their respective affiliates and agents may publish research from time to time on financial markets and other matters that may influence the value of the Notes, or express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any research, opinions or recommendations expressed by Barclays Capital Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc. or their respective affiliates or agents may not be consistent with each other and may be modified from time to time without notice. You should make your own independent investigation of the merits of investing in the Notes and each Underlying.

¨Potential Barclays Bank PLC impact on the levels of the Underlyings — Trading or transactions by Barclays Bank PLC or its affiliates in the securities composing the Underlyings and/or over-the-counter options, futures or other instruments with returns linked to

PS- 10

the performance of either or both Underlyings or the securities composing the Underlyings, may adversely affect the level of either Underlying and, therefore, the market value of the Notes.

¨We and our affiliates may engage in various activities or make determinations that could materially affect your Notes in various ways and create conflicts of interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to an Underlying or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underlyings and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlyings” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

¨There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

¨Many economic and market factors will impact the value of the Notes — Structured notes, including the Notes, can be thought of as securities that combine a debt instrument with one or more options or other derivative instruments. As a result, the factors that influence the values of debt instruments and options or other derivative instruments will also influence the terms and features of the Notes at issuance and their value in the secondary market. Accordingly, in addition to the levels of the Underlyings on any day, the value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

¨the expected volatility of the Underlyings;

¨correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Underlyings;

¨the time to maturity of the Notes;

¨the market prices of, and dividend rates on, the securities composing the Underlyings;

¨interest and yield rates in the market generally;

¨supply and demand for the Notes;

¨a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events;

¨the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro; and

¨our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

¨The estimated value of your Notes is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Trade Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

¨The estimated value of your Notes might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Trade Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in

PS- 11

the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Also, this difference in funding rate as well as certain factors, such as sales commissions, selling concessions, estimated costs and profits mentioned below, reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you.

¨The estimated value of the Notes is based on our internal pricing models, which may prove to be inaccurate and may be different from the pricing models of other financial institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Trade Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

¨The estimated value of your Notes is not a prediction of the prices at which you may sell your Notes in the secondary market, if any, and such secondary market prices, if any, will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes and may be lower than the estimated value of your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

¨The temporary price at which we may initially buy the Notes in the secondary market and the value we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Trade Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Trade Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

Hypothetical Examples

Hypothetical terms only. Actual terms may vary. See the cover page for actual offering terms.

The examples below illustrate the payment upon a call or at maturity for a $10 principal amount Note on a hypothetical offering of the Notes under various scenarios, with the assumptions set forth below.* You should not take these examples as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the Notes. The examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes. Numbers appearing in the examples below have been rounded for ease of analysis. In these examples, we refer to the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index as the “RTY Index” and the “SX5E Index,” respectively.

Term: Approximately 1.25 years (unless called earlier at the election of the Issuer) Coupon Rate: 9.20% per annum (or 0.7667% per month) Monthly Coupon: $0.0767 per month Hypothetical Initial Underlying Level: 100.000 for the RTY Index and 100.00 for the SX5E Index Hypothetical Downside Threshold: 70.000 for the RTY Index and 70.00 for the SX5E Index (which, with respect to each Underlying, is 70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlying Level of that Underlying) Optional Call Notice Dates: Monthly, beginning on March 17, 2026, as set forth under “Final Terms” in this pricing supplement

*Terms used for purposes of these hypothetical examples do not represent the actual Initial Underlying Levels or Downside Thresholds. The hypothetical Initial Underlying Levels of 100.000 for the RTY Index and 100.00 for the SX5E Index have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the actual Initial Underlying Levels for the Underlyings. The actual Initial Underlying Level and Downside Threshold of each Underlying are set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement. For historical Closing Levels of the Underlyings, please see the historical information set forth under the sections titled “Russell 2000® Index” and “EURO STOXX 50® Index” below. We cannot predict the Closing Level of either Underlying on any day during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date.

The examples below are purely hypothetical. These examples are intended to illustrate (a) the effect of an Issuer-elected call, (b) how the value of the payment at maturity on the Notes will depend on whether the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold and (c) how the total return on the Notes may be less than the total return on a direct investment in either or both Underlyings in certain scenarios. The “total return” as used in this pricing supplement is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the total payments per Note over the term of the Notes to the $10 principal amount.

Example 1 — Issuer Elects to Call the Notes on the First Optional Call Notice Date

Payment on Call Settlement Date: $10.0767 ($10.00 + $0.0767) Prior Monthly Coupons: $0.1534 ($0.0767 × 2) Total: $10.2301 Total Return: 2.301%

On the first Optional Call Notice Date (which occurs approximately three months after the Trade Date), the Issuer elects to call the Notes. The Issuer will pay you on the Call Settlement Date $10.0767 per Note, which is equal to your principal amount plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date. No further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer has previously paid the Monthly Coupon of $0.0767 on each of the first two Coupon Payment Dates. Accordingly, the Issuer will have paid a total of $10.2301 per Note for a total return of 2.301% on the Notes.

PS- 13

Example 2 — Notes Are NOT Called and the Final Underlying Level of Each Underlying Is At or Above Its Downside Threshold

Payment at Maturity: $10.0767 ($10.00 + $0.0767) Prior Monthly Coupons: $1.0738 ($0.0767 × 14) Total: $11.1505 Total Return: 11.505%

In this example, the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Notes remain outstanding until maturity. Because the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you on the Maturity Date $10.0767 per Note, which is equal to your principal amount plus the final Monthly Coupon.

In addition, the Issuer has previously paid the Monthly Coupon of $0.0767 on each of the fourteen Coupon Payment Dates that occur prior to the Final Valuation Date. Accordingly, the Issuer will have paid a total of $11.1505 per Note for a total return of 11.505% on the Notes.

PS- 14

Example 3 — Notes Are NOT Called and the Final Underlying Level of At Least One Underlying Is Below Its Downside Threshold

Payment at Maturity: $4.5767 ($4.50 + $0.0767) Prior Monthly Coupons: $1.0738 ($0.0767 × 14) Total: $5.6505 Total Return: -43.495%

In this example, the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Notes remain outstanding until maturity. Because the Final Underlying Level of at least one Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date, at maturity, the Issuer will pay the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than the principal amount, resulting in a loss of principal proportionate to the decline of the Lesser Performing Underlying. The payment at maturity will be calculated as follows:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

Step 1: Calculate the Underlying Return of each Underlying:

Underlying Return of the RTY Index:

Final Underlying Level – Initial Underlying Level = 45.000 – 100.000 = -55.00% Initial Underlying Level 100.000

Underlying Return of the SX5E Index:

Final Underlying Level – Initial Underlying Level = 110.00 – 100.00 = 10.00% Initial Underlying Level 100.00

Step 2: Determine the Lesser Performing Underlying. The RTY Index is the Underlying with the lower Underlying Return.

Step 3: Calculate the Payment at Maturity:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

= [$10 × (1 + -55.00%)] + $0.0767

= $4.50 + $0.0767

= $4.5767

In addition, the Issuer has previously paid the Monthly Coupon of $0.0767 on each of the fourteen Coupon Payment Dates that occur prior to the Final Valuation Date. Accordingly, the Issuer will have paid a total of $5.6505 per Note for a total return of -43.495% on the Notes.

What Are the Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes?

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Put Options and Deposits” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes.

Due to the lack of direct legal authority, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes. Our special tax counsel believes that it is reasonable to treat a Note for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a put option (the “Put Option”) written by you to us with respect to the Lesser Performing Underlying, secured by a cash deposit equal to the initial issue price of the Notes (the “Deposit”), which will have an annual yield based on our cost of borrowing, as shown below. If this treatment is respected, only a portion of each Monthly Coupon will be attributable to interest on the Deposit; the remainder will represent premium attributable to your grant of the Put Option (“Put Premium”). By purchasing the Notes, you agree to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes consistently with the treatment and allocation as described above. We will follow this approach in determining our information reporting responsibilities, if any.

Assuming the treatment and allocation described above are respected, interest on the Deposit will be taxed as ordinary income, while the Put Premium will not be taken into account prior to the taxable disposition of the Notes (including upon early redemption or at maturity). Assuming that you are an initial purchaser of Notes purchasing the Notes at the initial issue price for cash, (i) if your Notes are called or held to maturity and the Put Option expires unexercised (i.e., you receive a cash payment—not including the final Monthly Coupon—at maturity equal to the amount of the Deposit), you will recognize short-term capital gain in an amount equal to the total Put Premium received, and (ii) if, instead, the Put Option is deemed to be exercised at maturity (i.e., you receive a cash payment at maturity—not including the final Monthly Coupon—that is less than the amount of the Deposit), you will recognize short-term capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (x) the total Put Premium received and (y) the cash settlement value of the Put Option (i.e., the amount of the Deposit minus the cash you receive at maturity, not including the final Monthly Coupon).

There are, however, other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt for the Notes, in which case the timing and character of your income or loss could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses on a number of issues, the most relevant of which for investors in the Notes are the character of income or loss (including whether the Put Premium might be currently included as ordinary income) and the degree, if any, to which income realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax. While it is not clear whether the Notes would be viewed as similar to the typical prepaid forward contract described in the notice, it is possible that any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Purchasers who are not initial purchasers of Notes at the initial issue price should also consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments, as well as the allocation of the purchase price of the Notes between the Deposit and the Put Option.

The discussions above and in the accompanying prospectus supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b).

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

Consistent with the position described above, below are the portions of each Monthly Coupon that we intend, in determining our reporting responsibilities (if any), to treat as attributable to interest on the Deposit and to Put Premium:

Coupon Rate

per Annum Interest on Deposit

per Annum Put Premium

per Annum 9.20% 4.05% 5.15%

Russell 2000® Index

The Russell 2000® Index (the “RTY Index”) measures the capitalization-weighted price performance of 2,000 U.S. small-capitalization stocks listed on eligible U.S. exchanges and is designed to track the performance of the small-capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. For more information about the RTY Index, see “Indices—The Russell Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

Historical Information

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the RTY Index from January 2, 2015 through December 17, 2025, based on the daily Closing Levels of the RTY Index. The Closing Level of the RTY Index on December 17, 2025 was 2,492.295. The dotted line represents the Downside Threshold of 1,744.607, which is equal to 70.00% of the Initial Underlying Level of the RTY Index.

We obtained the Closing Levels of the RTY Index from Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”), without independent verification. Historical performance of the RTY Index should not be taken as an indication of future performance. Future performance of the RTY Index may differ significantly from historical performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Closing Level of the RTY Index during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date. We cannot give you assurance that the performance of the RTY Index will not result in a loss of your principal amount.

Historical Information

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the SX5E Index from January 2, 2015 through December 17, 2025, based on the daily Closing Levels of the SX5E Index. The Closing Level of the SX5E Index on December 17, 2025 was 5,681.67. The dotted line represents the Downside Threshold of 3,977.17, which is equal to 70.00% of the Initial Underlying Level of the SX5E Index.

We obtained the Closing Levels of the SX5E Index from Bloomberg, without independent verification. Historical performance of the SX5E Index should not be taken as an indication of future performance. Future performance of the SX5E Index may differ significantly from historical performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Closing Level of the SX5E Index during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date.

Correlation of the Underlyings

The following graph sets forth the historical performances of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index from January 2, 2015 through December 17, 2025, based on the daily Closing Levels of the Underlyings. For comparison purposes, each Underlying has been normalized to have a Closing Level of 100.00 on January 2, 2015 by dividing the Closing Level of that Underlying on each day by the Closing Level of that Underlying on January 2, 2015 and multiplying by 100.00.

We obtained the Closing Levels used to determine the normalized Closing Levels set forth below from Bloomberg, without independent verification. Historical performance of the Underlyings should not be taken as an indication of future performance. Future performance of the Underlyings may differ significantly from historical performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Closing Levels of the Underlyings during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date. We cannot give you assurance that the performances of the Underlyings will not result in a loss of your principal amount.

PAST PERFORMANCE AND CORRELATION OF THE UNDERLYINGS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR CORRELATION.

The correlation of a pair of Underlyings represents a statistical measurement of the degree to which the returns of those Underlyings were similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. The correlation between a pair of Underlyings is scaled from 1.0 to -1.0, with 1.0 indicating perfect positive correlation (i.e., the value of both Underlyings are increasing together or decreasing together and the ratio of their returns has been constant), 0 indicating no correlation (i.e., there is no statistical relationship between the returns of that pair of Underlyings) and -1.0 indicating perfect negative correlation (i.e., as the value of one Underlying increases, the value of the other Underlying decreases and the ratio of their returns has been constant).

The closer the relationship of the returns of a pair of Underlyings over a given period, the more positively correlated those Underlyings are. The graph above illustrates the historical performance of each Underlying relative to each other over the time period shown and provides an indication of how close the relative performance of each Underlying has historically been to the other Underlying. However, the graph does not provide a precise measurement of the correlation of the Underlyings. Moreover, any historical correlation of the Underlyings is not indicative of the degree of correlation of the Underlyings, if any, that will be experienced over the term of the Notes.

The lower (or more negative) the correlation between the Underlyings, the less likely it is that the Underlyings will move in the same direction at the same time and, therefore, the greater the potential for one of the Underlyings to close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date. This is because the less positively correlated the Underlyings are, the greater the likelihood that at least one of the Underlyings will decrease in value. However, even if the Underlyings have a higher positive correlation, one or both of the Underlyings might close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date, as both of the Underlyings may decrease in value together.

Although the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Coupon Rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Coupon Rate is generally associated with lower correlation of the Underlyings, which reflects a greater potential for a loss of principal at maturity. The correlation referenced in setting the terms of the Notes is calculated using our internal models and is not derived from the returns of the Underlyings over the period set forth above. In addition, other factors and inputs other than correlation may impact how the terms of the Notes are set and the performance of the Notes.

INDIANAPOLIS — Eli Lilly and Co. announced Thursday, Dec. 18 that its experimental daily GLP-1 pill, orforglipron, successfully helped patients maintain significant weight loss after they stopped using popular injectable treatments like Wegovy and Zepbound.

The Phase 3 ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial is the first of its kind to demonstrate that a “small molecule” oral drug can prevent the weight regain that often occurs when patients cease injectable incretin therapies. Lilly confirmed it has submitted the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval.

In the 52-week study, participants who switched from Wegovy to orforglipron maintained almost all of their progress, seeing an average weight change of less than one kilogram. Those who switched to the pill from Zepbound saw a modest average increase of 5 kilograms but fared significantly better than those on a placebo, who experienced rapid weight regain.

“Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge,” said Kenneth Custer, Lilly’s executive vice president of cardiometabolic health in a press release. He noted that the pill offers a “convenient alternative” for long-term weight management without the need for weekly needles.

Orforglipron works as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, similar to the active ingredients in current injectables, but its chemical structure allows it to be absorbed effectively through the digestive tract. Current blockbuster treatments are peptides, meaning short chains of amino acids. Because they are large, fragile molecules, the human stomach would digest them like the protein in steak or eggs before they could enter the bloodstream. This is why they must be injected into the fatty tissue to bypass the digestive system.

Orforglipron is a small molecule drug. Unlike peptides, these are chemically synthesized to be much smaller and more stable. They are designed to survive the harsh, acidic environment of the stomach and pass through the intestinal wall into the blood.

The study reported that side effects were primarily gastrointestinal, such as nausea and constipation, and were generally mild to moderate. No new safety concerns or liver issues were identified.

If approved, orforglipron would represent a major shift in the obesity market, providing a shelf-stable, easy-to-take option for millions of individuals transitioning out of the intensive weight-loss phase of their treatment.",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eli-Lilly-Adverum-Biotech-researcher-scientist-lab-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 08:58:00.323110

WASHINGTON – Friends of the Earth released its 2025 Bee-Friendly Retailer Scorecard, the leading national assessment of how the largest U.S. grocery retailers are addressing toxic pesticides in their supply chains. Several companies have recently strengthened their pollinator health policies, but widespread inaction continues to expose the industry to mounting financial, ecological, and consumer trust risks.

The Scorecard evaluates 25 of the country’s top grocery retailers on their commitments and progress toward reducing pesticides linked to the decline of bees, biodiversity, soil health, and human health. This year, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc (NASDAQ: SFM) became only the second company to score in the “A” range, joining Whole Foods. Sprouts revealed a new commitment to pollinator health this December. The policy aims to reduce use of toxic pesticides in the company’s supply chain and build on the its industry-leading organic sales.

Organic sales are a key differentiator for retailers on the scorecard: the USDA Organic seal remains the most trusted benchmark for reduced pesticide use, prohibiting more than 900 synthetic pesticides — including many linked to risks for pollinators, soil health, and human well-being.

Costco (NASDAQ: COST) also advanced notably, rising from a “C” to a “B+” due to strong organic sales and reported progress toward implementing itspollinator health policy. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) improved from an “F” to a “D-” based on Amazon Fresh sales of organic and other meaningful thirdparty certifications.

Laggards fall behind despite rising consumer concern about pesticides

While progress from top performers signals a shifting landscape, many retailers remain far behind. Six companies—Albertsons (NYSE: ACI), Aldi, CVS (NYSE: CVS), Kroger (NYSE: KR), Southeastern Grocers, and Target (NYSE: TGT)—lost points for failing to communicate meaningful progress toward meeting their pollinator health commitments.

Target fell from a “D-” to an “F,” joining Wegmans, BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE: BJ), H-E-B, Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA), Hy-Vee, Dollar General (NYSE: DG), Publix, and Wakefern.

The Scorecard’s findings come amid intensifying public concern about pesticide exposure. National polling consistently shows that consumers — especially parents — are increasingly seeking organic and pesticide-free options and expect retailers to be transparent about chemical use in their supply chains.

Recent investigative testing underscores these concerns: a Friends of the Earth-commissioned study detected multipletoxic pesticides in Target’sGood & Gather baby food, including neurotoxins, hormone disruptors, and PFAS “forever chemicals.”

Pesticides pose growing financial and supply-chain risks for retailers

A recent analysis commissioned by Friends of the Earth estimates that the U.S. food retail sector faces $219 billion in climate, financial, and biodiversity risks stemming from pesticide-dependent agriculture on just four major crops.

Retailers are also likely to face supply constraints and price volatility as pollinator populations decline. Research has already linked pollinator loss to reduced yields in key crops such as apples and cherries — products central to grocery produce departments.

“Pesticides are a linchpin in an industrial food system that is destroying the web of life — from pollinators to soil to human health,” said Kendra Klein, deputy director of science at Friends of the Earth. “Retailers have both the power and responsibility to accelerate a transition to safer, more resilient agriculture. The leaders on this Scorecard prove that progress is possible — and consumers are demanding it.”

Pesticide impacts extend beyond pollinators

All major classes of commonly used pesticides threatenthe soil organisms essential for carbon sequestration, water conservation, and climate resilience. These chemicals also harm human health—from the farmworkers who face daily exposure to consumers who encounter dozens of pesticide residues in their diets. A growing body of research shows even low-level exposures can pose serious risks to infants and children, yet federal standards fail to adequately protect vulnerable populations.

Retailers hold the key to systemwide change

The sector’s largest players — including Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Amazon, Albertsons, and Target — control an estimated $754 billion in annual grocery sales, giving them immense leverage to drive pesticide reduction across U.S. agriculture.

The Bee-Friendly Retailer campaign is supported by more than 100 beekeeping, farming, farmworker, consumer, and environmental organizations, including the Campaign for Healthier Solutions, which works with dollar stores to eliminate hazardous chemicals from store shelves.

Know Your Rights: According to Canada’s Passenger Bill of Rights, you may be entitled to compensation for significant delays and cancellations, especially when caused by reasons within the airline’s control.

Contact the Airline for Rebooking: If your flight is delayed or cancelled, contact the airline directly to rebook or arrange for accommodations if necessary.

Sign Up for Notifications: Most airlines offer text message or email alerts for flight status changes. Make sure you’re signed up so you can react quickly to any further disruptions.

Consider Alternative Routes: If your flight is cancelled or heavily delayed, ask the airline about potential alternative routes or connections. Consider flying from other nearby airports if possible.

Prepare for Extended Wait Times: With the continued weather disruptions, long wait times at airport terminals may occur. Pack essentials like snacks, medications, and entertainment to make your wait more comfortable.

As winter storms continue to impact major airports across Canada, travelers are urged to plan accordingly and monitor updates from their airlines. With ongoing snow, wind, and cold temperatures, disruptions are likely to persist in the coming days. Be sure to stay informed, check for cancellations, and take the necessary steps to ensure your travel plans proceed smoothly.

NEW YORK/TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 19 (Reuters) – SoftBank Group is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by year-end through an array of cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments, and could tap its undrawn margin loans borrowed against its valuable ownership in chip firm Arm Holdings, sources said.

The “all-in” bet on OpenAI is among the biggest yet by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, as the Japanese billionaire seeks ‍to improve his firm’s position in the race for artificial intelligence. To come up with the money, Son has already sold SoftBank’s entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia, offloaded $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile US stake, and slashed staff.

Son has slowed most other dealmaking at SoftBank’s Vision Fund to a crawl, and any deal above $50 million now requires his explicit approval, two of the sources told Reuters.

Son’s firm is working to take public its payments app operator, PayPay. The initial public offering, originally expected this month, was pushed back due to the 43-day-long U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. PayPay’s market debut, likely to raise more than $20 billion, is now expected in the first quarter of next year, according to one direct source and another person familiar with the efforts.

The Japanese ‌conglomerate is also looking to cash out some of its holdings in Didi Global, the operator of China’s dominant ride-hailing platform, ‌which is looking to list its shares in Hong Kong after a regulatory crackdown forced it to delist in the U.S. in 2021, a source with direct knowledge said. Investment managers at SoftBank’s Vision Fund are being directed toward the OpenAI deal, two of the above sources said.

SoftBank’s scramble to marshal funds offers a window into the strain faced even by the world’s biggest dealmakers as they scramble to finance ambitious AI data center projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

SoftBank declined to comment.

SOFTBANK HAS OPTIONS

OpenAI has not yet received the remaining funding, ​but expects the money to come in by the end of 2025, as stipulated in the contract, sources said.

SoftBank has multiple sources of capital it could tap, including margin loans, cash on its balance sheet, stakes in listed companies, and corporate bonds or bridge loans, sources said.

Son has strong reasons to draw on a range of funding mechanisms to fulfill ‍those obligations. SoftBank secured a deal to invest in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation in April. Since ​then, the valuation of OpenAI has risen dramatically and the company is in talks to raise additional funding from investors, including Amazon, tripling ​its valuation to close to $900 billion, one of the sources added, which would give SoftBank a significant paper gain once the transaction is completed.

A major pool of capital for SoftBank ‍is its undrawn capacity of margin loans borrowed against its ownership of British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings. SoftBank recently expanded its margin loan capacity by $6.5 billion, bringing the total undrawn capacity to $11.5 billion. Arm’s stock has since tripled from its IPO price, providing SoftBank with additional collateral headroom to expand its borrowing capacity.

SoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen ($27.16 billion) as of September 30. The group still owns about 4% of T-Mobile US, remaining the wireless carrier’s second-largest shareholder, a stake worth roughly $11 billion at the end of September, according to LSEG data.

Despite investing at a less active pace, it has continued to back AI startups such as Sierra and Skild AI.

OPENAI NEEDS THE ‍MONEY

Both OpenAI and SoftBank are investors in Stargate, a $500 billion initiative to build AI data centers for training and inference that executives say is crucial to the U.S. government’s ambitions to keep ahead of China in AI.

The rush to build data centers has also prompted tech giants including Meta Platforms to commit unprecedented sums to these buildouts – which need chips, ‍power, cooling, and servers – and they have brought in deep-pocketed ‍partners to spread the risk. Their hefty capital outlays have sparked concerns about what happens if the investments fail to bring commensurate ​returns, raising the specter of an “AI bubble” bursting.

SoftBank promised in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI – $10 billion of which ​the startup would receive ⁠the same month. The rest of the payment was contingent on the AI startup transitioning to a for-profit corporation by ‌the end of the year, an ambitious feat that OpenAI achieved in October.

The new funding is crucial for covering OpenAI’s rising costs to train and run its AI models as competition from Alphabet’s Google ratchets up. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees recently that the company is now entering a “code red” phase to improve ChatGPT — delaying other product rollouts to fend off the momentum behind Google’s Gemini.

In October, Altman said OpenAI aimed to build 30 gigawatts of computing capacity for $1.4 trillion. He said he ultimately wants OpenAI to add 1 gigawatt of compute every week – an enormous target given that each gigawatt currently comes with a capital cost of more than $40 billion.

What's inspiring creatives in 2025

Apple continues to shape how creative professionals think and build. In Adobe’s survey, 29% of respondents named Apple the most creatively inspiring brand, far ahead of Adidas (17%) and Google (16%). The brand’s blend of visual minimalism, product consistency, and emotional resonance keeps it front and center across industries.

On the public figure side, Beyoncé and Rihanna tied at 19% each, followed by Taylor Swift (17%), Billie Eilish (15%), and Bad Bunny (14%). Each has built a visual and cultural brand that extends far beyond music.

Minimalism and nostalgia are tied at the top when it comes to aesthetic inspiration, each scoring 25%. Creators are clearly split between forward-looking simplicity and throwback familiarity.

The platforms and formats driving content ideas

TikTok is now the go-to platform for creative inspiration. Nearly one in three creatives (29%) said they turn to the app first, followed by Instagram (25%) and YouTube (20%). The constant stream of trend-driven content on these platforms helps creators stay plugged into what’s resonating in real time.

Short-form video dominates as the most inspiring content type. Over half of the creatives surveyed (56%) cited it as their top source of inspiration, outpacing memes and pop culture (35%) and long-form video (33%).

What’s notable is how many creatives actively reverse-engineer content. Half said they analyze social posts to understand what works. Another 42% look at branding and visual elements, while 35% study videos. Dissecting what resonates has become a core part of the ideation process.

Why brand identity is getting a refresh

Looking ahead to 2026, 48% of creatives said they plan to update their brand identity. Eleven percent are going further and planning a full rebrand. This reflects a broader need to adapt to shifting audience expectations and rising visual standards.

But staying relevant isn’t easy. Over half of respondents (56%) said they feel pressured to follow design trends. Thirty percent said they feel overwhelmed by the volume of new trends surfacing across platforms.

Despite that, creatives are aiming for balance. While 39% prioritize originality, 50% said the key is blending original thinking with trend awareness. Only 11% said following trends should take priority.

What marketers should know

Here’s what brand strategists and creative leads should take away from Adobe’s findings:

1. Treat TikTok as a trend engine, not just a channel

If your team isn’t using TikTok to monitor visual trends and content formats, you’re missing a major source of inspiration. It’s where ideas start, not just where they’re shared.

2. Build systems for fast creative iteration

With short-form content and visual remixing taking over, speed matters. Use tools like mood board makers and video templates to test and scale ideas quickly.

3. Anticipate a rebranding wave in 2026

If nearly half of creatives are preparing to update their brand identity, your competitors might be among them. Now is the time to evaluate your own branding and decide whether it’s built for the next wave of visual trends.

4. Don’t choose between minimalism and nostalgia

Both styles are peaking. Minimalism offers clarity in noisy feeds, while retro design taps into emotional storytelling. Experiment with both to see what resonates with your audience.

5. Support originality with structure

Original content doesn't mean starting from scratch. Encourage your team to study top-performing content, then layer in unique brand elements. Reverse-engineering is part of the process now.

Today’s creators are working in a space that’s moving faster than ever, but they’re not chasing trends blindly. They’re blending what works with their own creative DNA, whether that means leaning into Apple-level design polish or borrowing TikTok’s fast-cut energy.

For marketers, the message is clear. Watch what’s inspiring creators, and build flexible systems that help your brand move at the speed of culture.",https://www.contentgrip.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/12/What-inspires-today---s-creators-Apple--TikTok--and-minimalist-design-trends.webp,N,,2025-12-19 22:58:24.688398

(KDP, Financial) has announced a major financial move by entering into a Term Loan Agreement on December 18, 2025. The agreement, involving lenders and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as the administrative agent, provides KDP with a 364-day term loan facility amounting to €10.35 billion. This strategic financial arrangement is set to support the company's planned acquisition of JDE Peet's.

The loan will bear interest at a rate tied to the EURIBO rate, with an additional margin ranging from 0.750% to 1.750%, contingent on the rating of certain index debt of KDP. Additionally, undrawn commitments will incur a commitment fee starting December 23, 2025, ranging from 0.060% to 0.200%, also dependent on the debt rating.

Obligations under this agreement are backed by KDP's subsidiaries that guarantee its revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes. The agreement includes provisions for mandatory reductions or prepayments of the term loans with net cash proceeds from non-ordinary course asset sales, debt issuances, and equity issuances, subject to specific qualifications and exceptions.

The Term Loan Agreement encompasses customary representations and warranties for investment-grade Dutch certain funds financings. It also includes affirmative covenants imposing reporting and operational obligations on KDP and its subsidiaries, alongside negative covenants that restrict certain actions, such as incurring liens and executing fundamental changes. Financial covenants include a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 and a maximum total net leverage ratio of 6.25 to 1.00, applicable under specific conditions.

In conjunction with this, KDP has amended its Bridge Credit Agreement, reducing the lenders' commitment by €10.35 billion, from €16.2 billion to €5.85 billion. This amendment ensures that certain debt proceeds will first reduce amounts under the Term Loan Agreement before affecting the Bridge Credit Agreement.

This strategic financial maneuver positions Keurig Dr Pepper to effectively fund its acquisition of JDE Peet's, potentially using proceeds from other debt or financings as alternatives to the Term Loan Agreement.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C000013NW.png?5,N,,2025-12-20 14:00:43.031996

With revenues of €6,2 billion in 2024, Dassault manages considerable volumes of data, a significant portion of which directly or indirectly relates to defense.","Data security is no longer a secondary issue for the defense industry. It has become a strategic lever in its own right. By announcing on December 16, 2025, its choice to rely on the Bleu trusted cloud to host its collaborative solutions, Dassault Aviation is taking a further step in the digital protection of its military programs. Behind a seemingly conventional technological decision lies a profound evolution in operational requirements, where infrastructure sovereignty directly conditions industrial security. The collaborative environments used by Dassault concentrate some of the group's most sensitive information. They include design data, exchanges between engineers, contractual documents, and elements related to the monitoring of civil and military aeronautical programs, sometimes spanning several decades. In this context, the choice of cloud infrastructure is no longer simply a matter of IT convenience. It commits the company to controlling access to its data and protecting itself against any external legal constraints. Dassault Aviation explains that using Bleu allows it to benefit from the advanced technologies of Microsoft Azure and Office 365 while ensuring that the environment remains exclusively governed by European law. This clarification directly addresses concerns related to extraterritorial legislation, which could impose access to data hosted by non-European entities. For a group at the heart of strategic programs, this exposure now constitutes an unacceptable risk.

Blue, a technological compromise under French control

Bleu is a company owned by Capgemini and Orange, operating a cloud infrastructure in France and governed by French law. For Dassault, this architecture allows for the combination of modern digital tools with strict access control, enhanced traceability, and governance compatible with the constraints of military programs. The group is not abandoning next-generation collaborative solutions, but is integrating them into a controlled framework designed for long-term sustainability. This operational continuity is a key point. Defense aeronautical programs require the stability of digital tools over extended periods, well beyond traditional technology cycles. The cloud must therefore be both scalable and sufficiently secure to support these projects without disruption or excessive dependence on external providers. The choice of Bleu is also based on the SecNumCloud 3.2 qualification, which the operator is currently pursuing. This label, awarded by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), represents the highest French standard for hosting sensitive data. It imposes strict requirements regarding sovereignty, physical security, cybersecurity, and governance, in line with the expectations of the Ministry of the Armed Forces and state authorities. Dassault Aviation also indicates that it is considering ""restricted distribution"" certification for certain functionalities hosted on Bleu. This graduated approach allows the digital architecture to be adapted to the different levels of sensitivity of the information processed, without systematically switching to completely isolated environments. It reflects a pragmatic evolution of the digital defense doctrine, which accepts the cloud subject to rigorous and certified compartmentalization.

Digital sovereignty and industrial resilience

Beyond the technical aspects, Dassault Aviation's decision is part of a broader strategy of strategic autonomy. By securing its collaborative solutions on a trusted French cloud, the group reduces its dependence on foreign infrastructure while maintaining access to cutting-edge technologies. In a context of proliferating state-sponsored and hybrid cyber threats, the protection of industrial data is becoming an indirect factor in operational superiority. With revenues of €6,2 billion in 2024, Dassault manages considerable volumes of data, a significant portion of which directly or indirectly relates to defense. Securing this data is essential for the design of weapons systems, industrial coordination, and the ability to meet the requirements of the armed forces. By partnering with Bleu, the company is also contributing to the development of a credible sovereign cloud ecosystem, aligned with French priorities in cybersecurity, digital sovereignty, and defense.",https://entrevue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Logo_E.png,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:09.216064

Earlier this year, CoreWeave became an NVIDIA Exemplar Cloud for NVIDIA H100 GPU using up to 1,024 GPUs and a 30 billion parameter Llama 2-style model.

Why participating in the Exemplar Cloud Initiative matters

By examining benchmark data, developers, researchers, and engineers are empowered to optimize their deployments with confidence and hold providers accountable for delivering on performance. This transparent approach to performance measurement is essential for running mission-critical AI workloads.

The most recent results demonstrate how CoreWeave’s multi-generation approach to fine-tuned GPU performance with full stack observability and relentless automated performance optimizations yields consistent peak performance and reliability. This means having the ability to deploy demanding AI applications, such as large-scale pretraining or disaggregated multi-node inference with the confidence that the AI workloads will run efficiently and as expected. This minimizes guesswork and surprises with each generation of GPUs, providing the predictability and reproducibility AI pioneers need as they evolve models and scale training.

Quantifiable performance: key benchmark results

GPU performance was measured using Model Flops Utilization (MFU), the independent gold standard for measuring efficiency in large model training. CoreWeave’s clusters demonstrated superior utilization compared to reference targets, validating the strength of our architecture and integrated software stack. Key results include:

DeepSeek v3 (BF16): Achieved a 1.9% greater MFU than the NVIDIA reference target on 512 GPUs, confirming CoreWeave’s optimizations for unmatched performance.

Llama 3 70B (FP8): Posted a 2.4% greater MFU on 512 GPUs, proving enhanced efficiency even on widely adopted open-source models.

Unlocking predictability for AI pioneers

This milestone affirms the performance customers consistently receive from CoreWeave’s platform across generations of software and hardware. Predictable, highly efficient performance is essential for today’s long running training workloads, and this commitment to excellence is how CoreWeave helps customers achieve results faster and accelerate development timelines.

The certification process rigorously tests performance and stability under extreme load, focusing on:

Cluster goodput and efficiency for optimal training: Maximizing the amount of useful work achieved by the GPU cluster, ensuring resources are not wasted on idle time or I/O bottleneck.

Performance scaling for faster training completion: Demonstrating predictable and efficient scaling across large, distributed GB200 NVL72 clusters.

Hardware and system resilience for uninterrupted training: Validating the underlying infrastructure's ability to maintain stability during intense, prolonged training sessions.

Deep dive into CoreWeave’s groundbreaking results

To achieve these groundbreaking results, we didn't rely on a ""cherry-picked"" performance lab environment. Instead, the Exemplar Cloud benchmarks were conducted on a standard CoreWeave cloud cluster. The environment consisted of 8 racks of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems, seamlessly integrated via high speed NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform.

CoreWeave Mission Control was the key to operating the cluster with the utmost efficiency. It uses a massive dataset gathered from operating hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs to enable predictive failure detection and mitigation instead of passive monitoring. The system constantly tests and identifies suboptimal components, replacing them proactively before they can impact a customer's workload. This ensures that only the highest-performing, most reliable hardware is ever part of a cluster.

Our architecture is built to maximize performance, resiliency, and efficiency with deep integration between hardware and software. The runtime environment leverages a unified stack with performance optimizations across every layer from metal to model:

CoreWeave Bare Metal servers are fast, reliable, and performant, providing direct access to GPU computing resources without hypervisors that slow down processing, add overhead and latency. In addition, our network fabric enables high bandwidth memory and rapid data access for low latency, high throughput interconnects for the cluster.

CoreWeave Kubernetes Service (CKS) provides the base runtime environment and is fully integrated with CoreWeaveMission Control to minimize overhead and maximize compute performance.

CoreWeave Slurm on Kubernetes (SUNK) enables topology aware scheduling which optimizes performance and utilization for large scale training clusters. Based on a battle-tested Slurm distribution scaled to handle tens of thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of concurrent jobs, SUNK is also fully integrated with CoreWeaveMission Control. This allows maintenance and predictive fault management to happen without interrupting active jobs.

During the training run, CoreWeave Cabinet Visualizer was used to monitor the health of our full rack systems. The dashboard displayed statistics and historical data of each cabinet, including its cooling system, node pools, and NVIDIA NVLink bandwidth usage.

CoreWeave Cabinet Visualizer dashboard displays health status and performance metrics for each NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 Rack. CoreWeave Mission Control constantly monitors signals, and determines an individual component as production quality in real time.

During the training run, jobs were tracked using CoreWeave Mission Control observability for infrastructure level monitoring, and Weights & Biases for job level monitoring.

During the displayed iteration of the Exemplar Cloud benchmark job, an underperforming component was intentionally added to the cluster to demonstrate always-on GPU straggler detection.

To ensure performance remained uniform across all 8 racks, we utilized a recently launched CoreWeave Mission Control feature, CoreWeave GPU Straggler Detection. This tool provides real-time collective metrics, including Bus Bandwidth, ensuring all GPUs and communication paths perform equally. GPU Straggler Detection also automatically detects any hardware lockups and pinpoints the root cause.

The continuous performance monitoring provided by CoreWeave Mission Control enabled the benchmark to complete successfully with no actions taken by the cluster administrators to isolate faults or underperforming components. When the system detected any potential hardware faults, CoreWeave Mission Control automatically isolated the issue, surfaced the data in the SUNK and Weights & Biases dashboards, and activated an automatic job restart on healthy nodes, providing an exceptional level of hardware and system resilience.

MLIPs enable atomistic simulations that combine the fidelity of computationally expensive quantum chemistry with the scaling power of AI.

Yet, developers working at this intersection face a persistent challenge: a lack of robust, Pythonic toolbox for GPU-accelerated atomistic simulation. For use cases such as running a large number of simultaneous, GPU-accelerated simulations, robust and well-supported tools are either missing in the current software ecosystem or are fragmented across several open source software tools.

Over the past few years, available software for running atomistic simulations with MLIPs has been CPU-centric. Core operations such as neighbor identification, dispersion corrections, long-range interactions, and their associated gradient calculation have traditionally supported only CPU computation, which often struggles to deliver the speed that contemporary research demands. High-throughput simulations of small- to medium-sized atomic systems quickly become bottlenecked by inefficient GPU usage in hybrid workflows where the model is GPU-accelerated in PyTorch but the simulation tooling is serial and CPU-based.

While developers have attempted to implement these operations directly in PyTorch over the years, the general-purpose design of PyTorch leaves performance on the table for the specialized spatial and force calculation operations required in atomistic simulation. This fundamental mismatch between PyTorch capabilities and the demands of atomistic modeling raises an important question: What’s needed to bridge this gap?

NVIDIA ALCHEMI (AI Lab for Chemistry and Materials Innovation), announced at Supercomputing 2024, provides chemistry and materials science developers and researchers with domain-specialized toolkits and NVIDIA NIM microservices optimized on NVIDIA accelerated computing platforms. It is a collection of high-performance, batched and GPU-accelerated tools specifically for enabling atomistic simulations in chemistry and materials science research at the machine learning framework level.

NVIDIA ALCHEMI delivers capabilities across three integrated layers:

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops: A repository of GPU-accelerated, batched common operations for AI-enabled atomistic simulation tasks, such as neighbor list construction, DFT-D3 dispersion corrections, and long-range electrostatics.

ALCHEMI Toolkit: A collection of GPU-accelerated simulation building blocks, including geometry optimizers, integrators, and data structures to enable large-scale, batched simulations leveraging AI.

ALCHEMI NIM microservices: A scalable layer of cloud‑ready, domain‑specific microservices for chemistry and materials science, enabling deployment and orchestration on NVIDIA‑accelerated platforms.

This post introduces NVIDIA ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops, the accelerated batched common operations layer of ALCHEMI. ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops uses NVIDIA Warp to accelerate and batch common operations in AI-driven atomistic modeling. These operations are exposed through a modular PyTorch accessible API (with a JAX API targeted for a future release) that enables rapid iteration and integration with existing and future atomistic simulation packages.

Figure 1 shows the accelerated batched common operations for atomistic simulations included in this initial release of ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops. This beta release includes two versions of neighbor lists (naive and cell), DFT-D3 dispersion correction, and long-range coulombic (Ewald and Particle Mesh Ewald) functions.

Figure 2 demonstrates the performance of accelerated kernels in ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops versus popular kernel-accelerated models like MACE (cuEquivariance) and TensorNet (Warp) to achieve fully parallelized performance and scalability. The blue MLIP baseline allows comparison with advanced features like neighbor lists and dispersion corrections (DFT-D3). Test systems consisted of ammonia clusters of increasing size packed into various cells using Packmol. Timing results were averaged over 20 runs on an NVIDIA H100 80 GB GPU. The DFT-D3 calculation does not include 6Å due to the long-range nature of D3.

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops ecosystem integration

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops is designed to integrate seamlessly with the broader PyTorch-based atomistic simulation ecosystem. We are excited to announce in-progress integrations with leading open source tools in the chemistry and materials science community: TorchSim, MatGL, and AIMNet Central.

TorchSim

TorchSim, a next-generation open source atomistic simulation engine, is adopting ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops kernels to power its GPU-accelerated workflows.TorchSim is a PyTorch-native simulation engine purpose-built for the MLIP era, enabling batched molecular dynamics and structural relaxation across thousands of systems simultaneously on a single GPU. TorchSim will leverage our optimized neighbor lists to drive high-throughput batched operations without sacrificing flexibility or performance.

MatGL

MatGL (Materials Graph Library) is an open source framework for building graph-based machine learning interatomic potentials and foundation potentials for inorganic, molecular, and hybrid materials systems. By integrating ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops, MatGL significantly accelerates graph-based treatments of long-range interactions, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that are both faster and more computationally efficient without compromising accuracy.

AIMNet Central

AIMNet Central is a repository for AIMNet2, a general-purpose MLIP capable of modeling neutral, charged, organic, and elemental-organic systems with high fidelity. AIMNet Central is leveraging ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops to further enhance the performance of its flexible long-range interaction models. Using NVIDIA-accelerated DFT-D3 and neighbor list kernels, AIMNet2 can deliver even faster atomistic simulations for large and periodic systems without compromising accuracy.

Feature highlights

This section dives into three ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops initial features: high-performance neighbor lists, DFT-D3 dispersion corrections, and long-range electrostatic interactions.

Neighbor lists

Neighbor list construction is the backbone of atomistic simulations enabling calculation of energies and forces with local or semi-local MLIPs. ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops delivers state-of-the-art GPU performance in PyTorch, achieving performance scaling to millions of atoms per second for batches of many small to medium atomic systems or single large atomic systems.

Capabilities

Both O(N) (cell list) and O(N²) (naive) algorithms with batched processing

Periodic boundary support for triclinic cells with arbitrary cell dimensions and partial periodicity

Supports end-to-end compute graph compilation

Direct API compatibility with PyTorch

API example

import torch from nvalchemiops.neighborlist import neighbor_list # Water molecule water_positions = torch.tensor([ [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], # O [0.96, 0.0, 0.0], # H [-0.24, 0.93, 0.0], # H ], device=""cuda"", dtype=torch.float32) # Ammonia molecule (NH3) ammonia_positions = torch.tensor([ [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], # N [1.01, 0.0, 0.0], # H [-0.34, 0.95, 0.0], # H [-0.34, -0.48, 0.82], # H ], device=""cuda"", dtype=torch.float32) # Concatenate positions for batch processing positions = torch.cat([water_positions, ammonia_positions], dim=0) # Create batch indices (0 for water, 1 for ammonia) batch_idx = torch.cat([ torch.zeros(3, dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda""), # Water torch.ones(4, dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda""), # Ammonia ]) # Define cells for each molecule (large enough to contain them without PBC) cells = torch.stack([ torch.eye(3, device=""cuda"") * 10.0, # Water cell torch.eye(3, device=""cuda"") * 10.0, # Ammonia cell ]) # non-periodic molecule case pbc = torch.tensor([ [False, False, False], # Water [False, False, False], # Ammonia ], device=""cuda"") # Cutoff distance in Angstroms cutoff = 4.0 # Compute neighbor list; here we explicitly request a batched cell list algorithm neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shift_matrix = neighbor_list( positions, cutoff, cell=cells, pbc=pbc, batch_idx=batch_idx, method=""batch_cell_list"" ) print(f""Neighbor matrix: {neighbor_matrix.cpu()}"") # [7, num_neighbors.max()] print(f""Neighbors per atom: {num_neighbors.cpu()}"") # [7,] print(f""Periodic shifts: {shift_matrix.cpu()}"")

DFT-D3 dispersion corrections

Realistic molecular modeling must fully account for van der Waals interactions, which standard DFT functionals do not account for systematically. DFT-D3 uses empirical pairwise corrections, leading to substantial improvements in binding energies, lattice structures, conformational analysis, and adsorption studies for common DFT functionals.

Capabilities

Becke-Johnson (BJ) rational damping variant

Supports batched and periodic calculations

Supports smoothing at cutoff distance

Joint energy, forces, and virial calculation

API example

from nvalchemiops.interactions.dispersion import dftd3 batch_ptr = torch.tensor([0, 3, 7], dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda"") atomic_numbers = torch.tensor( [6, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1], dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda"" ) # For this snippet, assume d3_params is loaded as: # d3_params = D3Parameters(rcov=..., r4r2=..., c6ab=..., cn_ref=...) # Users can refer to the documentation to source DFT-D3 parameters # and understand the expected data structure d3_params = ... # call the DFT-D3 functional interface energy, forces, coordination_numbers = dftd3( positions=positions, numbers=atomic_numbers, a1=0.3981, a2=4.4211, s8=0.7875, # PBE parameters neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix, neighbor_matrix_shifts=shift_matrix, batch_idx=batch_idx, d3_params=d3_params ) print(f""Energies: {energy.cpu()}"") # [2,] print(f""Forces: {forces.cpu()}"") # [7, 3]

Limitations

The current implementation computes two-body terms only (C6 and C8). Three-body Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM/C9) contributions are not included. This generally leads to some over-estimation of dispersion energies.

Long-range electrostatic interactions

Accurate modeling of electrostatic interactions is critical for simulations involving ions/charged species and polar systems. Currently, the most common approach for MLIPs is to learn Coulomb interactions within the short-ranged model. Systematic underestimation of long-range Coulombic effects leads to loss of accuracy in binding energies, solvation structures, and interfacial phenomena.

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops provides fully GPU-accelerated Ewald summation methods—both standard Ewald and particle mesh Ewald (PME)—enabling GPU-accelerated, efficient and accurate treatment of long-range electrostatics in PyTorch.

For large periodic systems, Ewald-based methods separate electrostatic interactions into short-range and long-range components, each computed in the domain best suited for performance. ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops provides a dual-cutoff strategy that dramatically reduces redundant neighbor queries and memory overhead compared to naive all-pairs approaches, making high-throughput simulations of charged systems practical on modern GPUs. Users can choose between standard Ewald for smaller systems or PME for larger periodic systems, depending on their specific performance and accuracy needs.

Capabilities

Ewald summation method

Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) using B-splines

Supports batched and periodic systems

GPU-optimized computation, leveraging cuFFT for fast reciprocal-space evaluation

PyTorch integration provides native tensor support for end-to-end differentiable workflows

API example

from nvalchemiops.interactions.electrostatics import particle_mesh_ewald # charges for each atom are randomly generated here atomic_charges = torch.randn( positions.size(0), dtype=torch.float32, device=""cuda"" ) # compute energy and forces with particle mesh ewald energy, forces = particle_mesh_ewald( positions, atomic_charges, cells, alpha=0.3, # adjust Ewald splitting parameter batch_idx=batch_idx, neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix, neighbor_matrix_shifts=shift_matrix, compute_forces=True ) print(f""Energy: {energy.cpu()}"") # [2] print(f""Forces: {forces.cpu()}"") # [7, 3]

In an online announcement this week, DoorDash said its new app in ChatGPT lets users discover recipes, turn ingredients into shoppable grocery lists and complete purchases through DoorDash’s own app for delivery.

For now, the ChatGPT experience is limited to groceries and select users, the delivery giant said, with broader access and additional categories planned over time. Participating retailers include grocery giants such as Kroger and Safeway, along with regional chains including Wegmans, Bi-Rite, Schnucks and Fairway Markets.

Reaching shoppers earlier in the decision process

More broadly, DoorDash is positioning the integration as a way to reach consumers earlier. This can occur at the moment they’re deciding to make a meal, before they’ve opened a grocery app or typed in a search query.

By showing up inside conversational AI tools like ChatGPT, DoorDash said it’s effectively creating another discovery channel — one that surfaces grocery options in real time and gives consumers and merchants another entry point.

The move follows a similar rollout by Instacart earlier this month. Unlike Instacart’s integration, however, DoorDash’s experience stops short of supporting checkout directly inside the chat.

To get started with DoorDash in ChatGPT, users can go to their account settings, open the “apps” section and sign in to their DoorDash account. From there, DoorDash can be toggled on directly within a chat.

Shoppers can ask ChatGPT for meal or recipe ideas — such as “easy, hearty soups to make for dinner tonight” — and receive tailored recommendations, DoorDash said.

Once a recipe is selected, users can prompt ChatGPT to shop for those ingredients. The app then converts those items into a shoppable grocery list directly within the chat.

When shoppers are ready to place an order, they move into the DoorDash app to review the cart, make changes and complete the purchase from a nearby store. Unlike Instacart’s integration, DoorDash’s experience does not support OpenAI’s Instant Checkout feature.

What DoorDash brings — and what comes next

The launch also comes as OpenAI rolls out its new in-chat app directory. There, users can discover and enable third-party apps, including DoorDash, Instacart and Uber Eats.

DoorDash said its app is currently available to a subset of users and will roll out more broadly in the coming weeks across iOS, Android, desktop and mobile web. The company did not specify which additional categories could follow groceries.

“As we expand this experience to more shopping categories, our focus is on building AI tools that give people time back and make local shopping easier,” said Andy Fang, DoorDash’s co-founder, in a statement.

The timing also coincides with DoorDash’s broader push to scale grocery delivery. In September, Kroger said it would extend its partnership with DoorDash to include full grocery delivery from roughly 2,700 stores in the U.S.

The deal increases DoorDash’s role in Kroger’s third-party delivery mix alongside Instacart and Uber. Kroger ranks No. 6 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 2000. The database ranks North America’s largest online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales.

Why DoorDash is launching inside ChatGPT now

For grocery and food retailers, the shift marks a move from AI as a discovery tool to more of an execution layer. That shift accelerated in July, when OpenAI introduced its ChatGPT agent framework. The move has fueled experimentation with so-called agentic commerce.

“These new systems can analyze household budgets, scan weekly promotions, suggest recipes, and even check what’s already in your pantry,” wrote Doug Baker, vice president of industry relations at FMI, the Food Marketing Institute, in a recent blog post.

He cautioned that the technology is still early.

“It’s nowhere near perfect yet because the content is not organized,” he said.

But said the pace of change signals how quickly the marketplace could move.

DoorDash’s ChatGPT app follows a separate, but related, step from OpenAI. Earlier this fall, the company opened ChatGPT more broadly to third-party apps, allowing developers to create in-chat experiences that let the AI handle more tasks on users’ behalf.

DoorDash, Instacart, Target and Uber were among the early partners named — a signal that delivery and commerce are emerging as early use cases.

How consumers view AI-assisted shopping

Survey data suggests consumers are increasingly open to using AI to shop, although with clear guardrails.

PwC’s 2025 Future of Consumer Shopping Survey found that 48% of respondents expect their online ordering of groceries and related categories to increase by 2030. Among millennials, that figure climbs to 62%.

Interest in AI-driven shopping is also growing. PwC found that 40% of respondents expect to increase their use of AI to find and compare products. Meanwhile, 33% expect to rely more on AI to make purchases. Among millennials, those figures rise to 54% and 47%, respectively.

Trust, however, remains a constraint. When asked what would make them comfortable letting an AI assistant make purchases, 29% of respondents would want to approve purchases before they happen. Others pointed to safeguards such as a 100% money-back guarantee (28%), the ability to revoke access at any time (25%) or strict spending limits (18%). Still, 32% said they would never trust an AI assistant with their financial access.

Nearly 80% of detections in CrowdStrike’s 2025 Global Threat Report were malware‑free, indicating that attackers relied on other techniques, such as social engineering and stolen credentials, to impersonate legitimate users, bypass controls, and escalate privileges.

[SC Media Perspectives columns are written by a trusted community of SC Media cybersecurity subject matter experts.Read more Perspectives here.]

To better understand the challenges organizations face today, we gathered insights from attendees at three major global cybersecurity conferences in 2025: Black Hat USA in Las Vegas; Infosecurity Europe in London; and the it-sa Expo&Congress in Nuremberg. Across all regions, practitioners cited identity as the new perimeter.

Why all the focus on identity?

Survey respondents consistently reported that identity‑based threats now surpass all other cyber risks. Phishing, credential theft, deepfakes, and privilege misuse ranked ahead of ransomware as the most likely sources of major breaches over the coming year. At Black Hat USA, 45% identified phishing as their primary concern and 41% cited deepfakes. Infosecurity Europe mirrored those results with phishing as the top identity-based threat for 50% of respondents and deepfakes for 42%.

These statistics reflect real‑world, costly incidents. The September 2025 Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) cyberattack demonstrates how identity‑based techniques, including vishing and credential theft, can cripple an organization’s global operations. Threat actors from Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters infiltrated JLR’s IT environment, causing severe production shutdowns and supply chain disruptions.

Digital identities have proliferated as hybrid, multi‑cloud and AI‑enabled environments expand. Every user, device and non‑human identity (NHI) represents a potential entry point. Outdated authentication methods and incomplete identity governance heighten exposure, making modernization an urgent priority.

AI: a double-edged sword

Cybercriminals now use AI to create more convincing phishing campaigns, generate deepfakes, automate ransomware and escalate privileges at scale.

However, confidence in defending against AI‑enhanced attacks remains low across regions. Only 12% of Infosecurity Europe respondents and 16% at Black Hat USA said their organizations are fully prepared. At it-sa Expo&Congress, readiness was slightly higher at 28%, but nearly one‑third of respondents expressed only partial confidence.

AI‑enhanced attacks are mainstream threats. Financial institutions report AI-driven voice cloning that circumvents authentication, and enterprises face increasingly targeted spear phishing attacks. Low‑level criminals can now impersonate executives with off-the-shelf deepfake tools.

While AI creates new risks, it also unlocks defensive advantages. Organizations adopt AI‑driven identity validation and behavioral analytics to validate identities, detect anomalies and terminate high-risk behavior in real time.

More than half of respondents across all three regions cited AI‑driven validation as the most impactful innovation for identity security, with 53% at Infosecurity Europe, 57% at Black Hat USA and 60% at it-sa Expo&Congress. Organizations that embed AI into identity and access frameworks can potentially gain visibility and resilience. Those that hesitate to adopt AI-enabled technologies risk falling behind amid accelerating threats and rising automation.

The importance of privileged access management

Despite universal agreement that identity has become central to cybersecurity, privileged access controls remain inconsistent. Security leaders know the path forward: strengthen privileged access, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and operationalize zero-trust.

Yet gaps persist. Across all three conferences, four in 10 organizations lack consistent MFA enforcement or comprehensive privileged access management (PAM) coverage. At Black Hat USA alone, 40% said their organization does not consistently enforce MFA for privileged accounts.

The February 2024 Change Healthcare attack, which compromised the data of more than 190 million Americans, stemmed from a single server lacking basic MFA. Bridging the divide between awareness and execution demands disciplined processes, continuous measurement and responsible use of AI across every layer of defense.

Achieving cyber resilience requires converting awareness into action. Here's what to do: secure identities, enforce least privilege, and embrace intelligent automation.

Modernizing identity controls and integrating AI thoughtfully into their security stack can help organizations withstand today’s threats and build secure, scalable growth for the future.

The collaboration extends behavioral measurement tools to Shopify's commerce platform, which powers millions of businesses across more than 175 countries.

The partnership addresses friction identification in digital shopping experiences. More than 1.3 million websites worldwide currently use Contentsquare's analytics platform, and the Shopify integration gives merchants access to session replay, heatmaps, zone-based analysis, performance monitoring, and AI-powered insights specifically within checkout flows.

""Shopify gives brands the foundation to grow, and Contentsquare shows them how to make every customer interaction count,"" said Jean-Christophe Pitié, Chief Marketing and Partner Officer at Contentsquare. ""With this partnership, teams finally get full visibility into the moments that drive revenue — and the ones that create friction — so they can fix issues faster and deliver the kind of shopping experience customers actually come back for.""

The technical implementation centers on a new Contentsquare Shopify Partner app that enables data collection without requiring engineering work, custom pixel implementations, or manual tagging plans. Installation occurs through a streamlined process designed for rapid deployment.

Measurement capabilities across checkout infrastructure

The Contentsquare platform captures granular behavioral data throughout Shopify checkout flows. Session replay functionality records individual customer sessions, showing exact navigation paths, click patterns, and points where shoppers abandon transactions. This visual playback capability operates independently of aggregate analytics, providing teams with detailed views of specific user experiences.

Heatmaps display which page elements attract engagement and which areas customers ignore. The zone-based approach breaks pages into discrete components, measuring performance at element-level granularity. Teams can analyze how placement, merchandising strategies, and cross-sell implementations affect engagement and sales outcomes.

Frustration scoring represents a core measurement methodology within the platform. The system detects signals indicating customer struggle, including rage clicks, repeated form field attempts, and error encounters. AI-powered analytics platforms score these frustration indicators, ranking sessions by business impact to prioritize technical resolutions.

Performance monitoring surfaces technical issues affecting revenue. The platform tracks page load speeds, broken elements, and errors that create friction during checkout processes. These signals combine with behavioral data to quantify how technical problems impact conversion rates.

Shopify Plus enterprise brands gain access to journey visualization showing how shoppers browse, search, and navigate across product categories. The complete view spans from first interaction through post-purchase, connecting disparate touchpoints into unified customer paths.

Integration mechanics and data architecture

The Shopify Partner app installation process eliminates traditional implementation barriers that require developer resources. Automatic data capture begins immediately after activation, tracking all interactions within the checkout environment without manual configuration requirements.

Zoning functionality automatically segments each page into measurable components. Teams can examine individual element performance without creating custom tracking specifications. This automated approach reduces the setup time typically associated with granular analytics implementations.

The platform processes event-scoped data, session-scoped measurements, and user-level aggregations. Event data captures specific interactions like button clicks or form submissions. Session data encompasses complete visit sequences. User data tracks behavior across multiple sessions, enabling lifecycle analysis and repeat purchase pattern identification.

Data flows into Contentsquare's analysis infrastructure where AI models process behavioral signals. The system identifies highest-impact optimization opportunities, flagging specific pages, elements, or flows where improvements would generate measurable conversion increases. Teams receive prioritized recommendations rather than undifferentiated data sets requiring manual interpretation.

Voice of customer capabilities integrate survey responses with behavioral data. When customers provide feedback, teams can access session replays showing the exact experience that prompted the response. This connection between qualitative feedback and quantitative behavior enables more precise diagnostic work.

Market context for ecommerce analytics

The Shopify partnership arrives as analytics platforms expand capabilities for measuring digital commerce. Google Analytics expanded ecommerce dimensions and metrics availability in reporting tools on August 25, 2025, addressing limitations in how merchants access product performance data. That enhancement enabled secondary dimensions, filters, comparisons, and customization options for ecommerce measurements that previously remained restricted.

Shopify's platform evolution has emphasized merchant tools and infrastructure components. The company launched Commerce Components on January 6, 2023, providing enterprise retailers with modular access to checkout systems and flexible APIs for custom integrations. That approach allowed retailers to adopt specific Shopify capabilities without migrating entire technology stacks.

More recently, Shopify announced the Product Network on December 10, 2025. The system enables product displays from third-party merchants across multiple storefronts, creating unified checkout experiences. Analytics capabilities within Product Network remain limited in initial documentation, though demonstration materials showed performance tracking across placements and category analysis.

Platform consolidation trends affect commerce infrastructure decisions. Meta phased out Facebook and Instagram shops checkout by August 2025, redirecting transactions to merchant websites. That shift eliminated payment processing responsibilities while maintaining advertising value propositions. For Shopify merchants specifically, Meta indicated order attribution would be temporarily lost during transition periods.

Analytics platform selection increasingly depends on integration depth and measurement granularity. Google Analytics published a reporting playbook in October 2025 addressing platform complexity across five reporting surfaces: Reports, Explore, Advertising, Data API, and BigQuery export. The documentation explained data scope hierarchies spanning user-level, session-level, event-level, and item-level measurements.

Technical specifications and use cases

Session replay within Contentsquare operates through smart capture technology that records all journey data while automatically masking personal information including payment details. Teams can review individual sessions or examine aggregated patterns across customer segments.

Event stream functionality highlights specific moments within replays. The system automatically identifies events affecting business outcomes—form submissions, site errors, checkout abandonment points—and creates timeline markers enabling teams to skip directly to relevant moments rather than reviewing complete sessions.

The platform provides session replay summaries using AI to distill single or multiple user sessions into concise overviews. This condensed format accelerates analysis by presenting key insights without requiring teams to review hours of footage.

Event-triggered recording captures sessions related to specific behaviors. Teams can configure the system to record only sessions containing negative feedback, cart abandonment, or error encounters. This selective approach reduces data volume while ensuring capture of high-priority interactions.

A/B testing analysis connects directly to session replay and heatmap data. When teams run experiments, they can examine why specific variants outperform others by reviewing actual customer behavior within each version. This behavioral context supplements statistical significance measurements with actionable insights about what elements drive performance differences.

Form analysis specifically addresses checkout friction. The platform measures completion rates, identifies frequently abandoned fields, and surfaces confusion indicators. Teams can examine heatmaps showing where customers hesitate or struggle, then access replays demonstrating actual form navigation patterns.

Impact quantification ranks sessions by business consequences. Rather than presenting all sessions equally, the system prioritizes replays where customers experienced significant friction, completed high-value purchases, or represented important segments. This filtering enables teams to focus analytical efforts on interactions with meaningful revenue implications.

Zone-based heatmaps extend beyond click tracking to attribution modeling. The platform calculates exposure rates, click rates, conversion rates, and revenue attribution for each page element. These measurements enable comparisons showing which images, calls-to-action, or product placements generate optimal outcomes.

Side-by-side heatmap analysis supports temporal comparisons, traffic source evaluations, and device-type assessments. Teams can examine how page element performance varies across different time periods, referral sources, or mobile versus desktop contexts.

Broader industry implications

The partnership reflects convergent trends around friction detection, AI-powered analysis, and checkout optimization. Customer experience platforms face mounting pressure to demonstrate clear return on investment. Sprinklr reported implementation difficulties with larger Contact Center as a Service projects on June 4, 2025, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and revenue recognition delays.

Analytical capabilities increasingly differentiate commerce platforms. Data governance challenges create barriers to AI implementation across industries. Research from Publicis Sapient showed 63 percent of energy sector leaders identified poor data quality as a top barrier to drawing insights, while 61 percent of telecommunications executives cited technical data debt delaying customer experience innovation.

The Contentsquare-Shopify integration addresses these concerns through automatic data capture eliminating manual configuration requirements. Clean, structured behavioral data flows into analysis systems without depending on merchant data governance practices.

Platform ecosystems continue expanding analytical tool access. Google Analytics added nine new data sources for cost data import on June 24, 2025, including BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3, and Snowflake. That expansion enabled marketers to consolidate advertising spend data from multiple platforms into unified interfaces.

Similar integration strategies appear across the martech landscape. Optimizely acquired NetSpring on September 30, 2024, bringing warehouse-native analytics capabilities to its experimentation platform. The acquisition enabled customers to connect experimentation activities directly to business metrics stored in data warehouses, processing analysis within existing data infrastructure.

Measurement methodologies emphasize connecting digital interactions to revenue outcomes. Traditional analytics platforms track page views, session durations, and bounce rates as proxy metrics. Behavioral analytics platforms like Contentsquare attempt more direct connections between specific customer actions and conversion events.

This shift from descriptive to diagnostic analytics changes how teams approach optimization. Instead of observing that conversion rates declined, teams can identify which page elements, technical errors, or checkout steps caused the decline. This diagnostic precision accelerates resolution cycles and focuses development resources on highest-impact fixes.

Privacy considerations and data handling

The Contentsquare platform implements automatic personal information masking. Payment card details, banking information, and other sensitive data undergo redaction during session recording. Teams can review customer behavior without accessing personally identifiable information.

Data processing occurs within Contentsquare's infrastructure rather than exposing raw behavioral data to merchant systems. This architecture reduces merchant responsibilities for behavioral data governance while maintaining measurement capabilities.

The platform operates within Shopify's ecosystem, avoiding third-party data sharing concerns that complicate retail media partnerships with external advertising platforms. All transactions and measurements occur within Shopify-managed systems with existing merchant relationships and user consent frameworks.

Cookie consent and tracking permission management remain merchant responsibilities. Contentsquare respects browser-level privacy controls and consent management platform configurations. When users decline tracking, behavioral monitoring ceases.

Implementation timeline and availability

The Contentsquare Shopify Partner app became available on December 17, 2025. Installation requires Shopify Plus for enterprise brands seeking complete feature access across checkout flows. Standard Shopify plans receive experience analytics features across storefronts excluding specific checkout measurement capabilities.

The partnership includes experience monitoring, user lifecycle analysis, and voice of customer features extending beyond checkout. These capabilities apply across the entire merchant storefront, providing comprehensive visibility into customer behavior from site entry through post-purchase.

Merchants using the platform can configure alerting for sudden frustration increases or technical error spikes. These proactive notifications enable rapid response to emerging issues before they significantly impact conversion rates.

The collaboration positions Contentsquare within Shopify's partner ecosystem alongside other analytics, marketing automation, and customer experience vendors. Merchants can combine Contentsquare behavioral insights with complementary tools addressing email marketing, advertising attribution, inventory management, and customer relationship management.

Technical requirements specify JavaScript compatibility and browser cookie support. Mobile app analytics extend to Shopify mobile commerce implementations, capturing touch interactions, swipe patterns, and mobile-specific navigation behaviors.

Data retention policies determine how long session recordings and behavioral measurements remain accessible. Merchants can configure retention periods balancing analytical needs against storage costs and privacy considerations.

Strategic positioning within commerce infrastructure

The announcement reflects Shopify's strategy of expanding merchant capabilities through partner integrations rather than building all functionality internally. This approach enables rapid feature deployment while allowing Shopify to focus engineering resources on core commerce platform development.

For Contentsquare, the partnership provides distribution to Shopify's merchant base. The company already serves more than 1.3 million websites globally, and Shopify represents substantial expansion opportunity within the ecommerce vertical.

Competing analytics platforms include Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics 4, Amplitude, Mixpanel, and Heap. Each platform emphasizes different measurement methodologies—product analytics, marketing analytics, behavioral analytics—creating segmented market positioning.

Session replay capabilities specifically have become standard features across customer experience platforms. However, implementation quality, AI-powered analysis, and integration depth vary significantly. Contentsquare differentiates through automated friction detection and impact quantification rather than providing undifferentiated session recording.

The focus on checkout flows addresses critical conversion points where small improvements generate outsized revenue impacts. Cart abandonment rates typically range from 60 to 80 percent across ecommerce sites, representing substantial recovery opportunities for merchants identifying and resolving specific friction sources.

The partnership arrives during peak shopping season preparation periods when merchants configure analytics and optimization tools for holiday traffic. Timing the announcement for December 17 positions the platform for implementation ahead of 2026 planning cycles.

Reis Nordland was saddled with repetitive customer service requests and the requirement to provide travel data around the clock.

All conversational data, agent telemetry and configuration metadata persist in IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL.","With the initial euphoria surrounding generative AI settling into a more realistic search for ROI, many businesses face the challenge of moving beyond prototypes. An overwhelming majority—95%, according to a recent MIT study—struggle to move from pilot to production with gen AI.

To help its clients buck the trend of high adoption with little to no meaningful business transformation, Frontkom, a Norway-based digital innovation firm, built a scalable, modular AI platform that delivers conversational assistants, search interfaces and retrieval applications for a range of customers—each with different data, scale and governance requirements.

One such client is Reis Nordland, the regional public transport provider for Nordland County in Norway. The company operates bus and ferry services across a vast northern region, managing schedules, ticketing and route information for travelers.

Frontkom developed and delivered a gen AI travel assistant that enables riders to ask natural-language questions, such as “When is the next ferry from Bodø?” or “Is route 300 delayed?” and receive accurate, up-to-date answers from a conversational assistant in multiple languages. Just weeks after launch, the application has cut inquiries to Reis Nordland’s customer service representatives by more than half.

Reis Nordland was saddled with repetitive customer service requests and the requirement to provide travel data around the clock. Frontkom’s conversational AI assistant connects to real-time transit feeds and structured internal data, such as timetables, traffic updates, FAQs and service policies. The goal was to provide factual, context-grounded responses, while keeping operators in full control of the responses a model provides.

This deployment improved traveler experience for the transit service provider, but it also demonstrated a template architecture that Frontkom reuses across other domains, including education, sustainability and municipal services.

To support rapid iteration while maintaining control and observability, Frontkom built a component-based architecture centered on IBM technologies and open-source tooling.

At the front end, a lightweight embeddable chat widget—built with JavaScript and React—integrates directly into the Reis Nordland website and mobile applications. This widget is paired with a secure dashboard interface built on Supabase, allowing Reis Nordland operators to manage their AI agents, datasets and knowledge bases from a single, user-friendly console.

The orchestration layer is powered by Langflow, IBM’s low-code visual environment for building AI agent applications. Langflow manages the logic, prompt design and response shaping behind each AI agent. This enables Frontkom to update components, including LLMs, data connectors or workflows, independently without affecting production stability.

After some research, the Frontkom team settled on the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for Reis Nordland’s use case. Should new or different models (or tools) become more appropriate in the next six months, updating will be a simple task, thanks to Langflow’s drag-and-drop modularity.

Langflow runs on Frontkom PaaS, a Kubernetes-based infrastructure hosted on AWS. It uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) to maintain reliability under variable traffic loads. A Fastly CDN sits in front of the system to ensure fast global delivery for both end users and administrative interfaces.

All conversational data, agent telemetry and configuration metadata persist in IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL. This choice provides both scalability and governance, with version control that tracks every flow and dataset used in production

Reis Nordland’s assistant now handles thousands of daily interactions, providing travelers with fast, multilingual responses. Updating the app is a far simpler process; The team can roll out new features or datasets in hours rather than weeks.

Support tickets have dropped significantly: in the first week alone, the new system resolved over 1,300 support tickets, prompting Reis Norland to describe its AI assistant as a “very valuable employee.” And the results keep getting better.

Four weeks after launch, the number of inquiries to the customer center decreased by 37% compared to last year. After six weeks, that statistic improved to 55%. At the same time, customer center response times were cut nearly in half (to about one day), despite fewer resources for manual answering. This is a result of fewer inquiries, as the chatbot is taking on the burden of answering many questions.

More importantly, the same architecture is being reused for other Frontkom clients—demonstrating that production-grade gen AI is repeatable when the foundation is modular, observable and governed.

With capital markets set for a slowdown through the year-end holidays, corporate issuers are laying the groundwork for a potential roadshow launch in early 2026 when the IPO market kicks back into action.

Fuel distributor ARKO Petroleum and drug developer Aktis Oncology also publicly filed paperwork for a New York IPO on Friday.

U.S.-listed IPOs have raised $75.3 billion as of December 17, the biggest yearly haul since 2021, according to data from Dealogic.

""We expect the rebound to continue in 2026, in part because there's a lot of recent news of private companies planning 2026 IPOs,"" said Nicholas Einhorn, director of research at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs.

Northridge, California-based MiniMed, whose offerings range from insulin delivery devices to glucose monitors, was founded in 1983 by Alfred Mann and bought by Medtronic in a nearly $3.3 billion deal in 2001.

The diabetes unit has grappled with regulatory concerns over quality management and cybersecurity issues related to its certain devices in the recent years, but has since returned to growth.

In May, Medtronic said it planned to spin off its diabetes unit through an IPO, followed by a subsequent split-off.

MiniMed reported a net loss of $21 million on net sales of $1.48 billion in the six months ended October 24, compared with net loss of $23 million on net sales of $1.30 billion a year earlier.

Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are the lead underwriters for the IPO. MiniMed, which has tapped more than 10 underwriters for the offering, will list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""MMED"".

Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.
To help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the manufacturers’ direct-buy websites.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.
The agreements also stop short of regulation that would force drugmakers to lower their prices, an approach Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully in his first term.","President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.

Mr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement are Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.

Drugmakers have been eager to strike voluntary deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

The three major drugmakers that have yet to announce deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Alexandra Bowie, a spokeswoman for Regeneron, said her company was still in talks with the administration.

Under the arrangements, the manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy the products.

To help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the manufacturers’ direct-buy websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.

The drugmakers also agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.

Medicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries. But administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drugs.

The drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.

In exchange, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might impose on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.

In the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in peer nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.

The deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.

The agreements also stop short of regulation that would force drugmakers to lower their prices, an approach Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully in his first term.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/19/multimedia/19hs-drug-pricing-twjb/19hs-drug-pricing-twjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 17:02:02.735831

The House Judiciary Committee has contacted JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and BNY Mellon, demanding financial records related to Epstein’s accounts and transactions.","Two class-action lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon could shed new light on how convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein allegedly financed his abuse network, and the role major financial institutions may have played in enabling it.

The lawsuits, filed by an anonymous Jane Doe plaintiff, accuse the banks of ignoring red flags, failing to report suspicious transactions and, in doing so, providing Epstein with the financial infrastructure needed to sustain his operation.

However, at a motions hearing Monday, a federal judge expressed skepticism, suggesting he may dismiss them before they go to trial unless the lawyers revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.

RELATED STORY | Lawmakers threaten legal action over delayed Epstein files release

The lawsuit against Bank of America alleges the company ""knowingly provided the financial support and the veneer of institutional legitimacy"" that allowed Epstein to operate under the ""guise"" of legitimate business activity.

The complaint claims the bank failed to file required Suspicious Activity Reports, or SARs, despite signs that Epstein’s financial behavior warranted closer scrutiny. The lawsuit describes that failure as ""wrongful and purposeful.""

Trial attorney Stacy Schneider, who is not involved in the case, told Scripps News in an interview that excessive cash withdrawals are a well-known trigger for mandatory reporting under federal banking regulations.

""Jeffrey Epstein apparently had so many excessive high cash withdrawals that it was causing some suspicion with the banks,"" Schneider said. ""And what happens when someone is doing excessive cash withdrawals is the bank is required to file an SAR, which is a suspicious activity report.""

A separate class-action lawsuit against BNY Mellon makes similar allegations, asserting the bank had a ""plethora of information"" about Epstein's operation.

EPSTEIN TIMELINE | From arrest and death to push for public release of DOJ files

The filing claims Epstein's crimes were enabled not only by his personal wealth and influence, but through ""access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including B-N-Y.""

""The bank could face severe penalties from the federal government for not doing proper reporting of suspicious activity,"" Schneider told Scripps News. ""But proving what was suspicious and what isn't suspicious is done by a case-by-case basis.""

Both Bank of America and BNY Mellon have asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuits, calling the claims “threadbare and meritless.”

The cases come amid mounting scrutiny of Wall Street’s past relationships with Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

The recent litigation follows major settlements by other financial institutions accused of overlooking Epstein’s conduct.

JPMorgan Chase agreed last year to pay $290 million to sexual abuse survivors who alleged the bank ignored warnings about Epstein’s behavior, though the bank did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

Deutsche Bank also reached a $75 million settlement, acknowledging it made a ""critical mistake"" in taking Epstein on as a client.

The House Judiciary Committee has contacted JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and BNY Mellon, demanding financial records related to Epstein’s accounts and transactions. Lawmakers allege the banks failed to take action for years, even as warning signs mounted.

A source familiar with the investigation confirmed to Scripps News that the Committee did receive responses from each bank, though they were largely non-responsive to the Committee’s questions. When pressed about whether they would provide documents, the banks either refused to answer or declined to do so absent a subpoena.

Committee Ranking Member Rep.

""Am I excited for OpenAI to be a public company? In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it'd be really annoying,"" Altman said on an episode of the ""Big Technology Podcast"" published Thursday.

Leadership seems to be one of the sticking points for Altman: ""Am I excited to be a public company CEO? 0%.""

""It's wonderful to be a private company,"" Altman said, but he added that OpenAI needs lots of capital and is going to ""cross all of the shareholder limits and stuff at some point.""

""I do think it's cool that public markets get to participate in value creation,"" Altman said.

Altman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015, and the company's value has soared since the launch of its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022.

ChatGPT has 800 million weekly users, and the company has inked $1 trillion worth of deals with tech giants like Oracle, Nvidia, and AMD.

In October, the company reached a $500 billion valuation after a secondary share sale, briefly overtaking Elon Musk's SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world, a crown that SpaceX regained in recent days.

The Information reported on Wednesday that OpenAI is seeking to raise billions more at a $750 billion valuation.

There are signs the company is preparing for a potential IPO. In October, Reuters reported that OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026.

But asked during the podcast if OpenAI would IPO next year, Altman responded, ""I don't know.""

Trump this month said he would allow sales of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, with the US government collecting a 25 per cent fee, and that the sales would help keep US firms ahead of Chinese chipmakers by cutting demand for Chinese chips.

The move drew fire from China hawks across the US political spectrum over concerns the chips would supercharge Beijing's military and erode the US ‍advantage in artificial intelligence. But questions have remained about ⁠how ‍quickly the US might approve such sales and whether Beijing would allow Chinese firms to purchase the Nvidia chips.

The US Commerce Department, which oversees export policy, has sent license applications for the chip sales to the State, Energy and Defense Departments ⁠for review, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the process is not public.

Those agencies have 30 days to weigh in, according to export regulations.

One of ‍the sources, an administration official, emphasised the review would be thorough and ""not some perfunctory box we are checking"".

But under the regulations, the final decision rests with Trump.

The start of the inter-agency licensing review has not been reported previously. The Commerce Department and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A White House spokesperson did not comment on the review, but said ""the Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security"".

BIDEN HAD BANNED ADVANCED AI CHIP SALES TO CHINA

The Biden administration had imposed a raft of restrictions on advanced AI chip sales to China and countries it ‌feared could become conduits for smuggling into the rival nation, citing national security fears.

Trump's move represents a departure from that policy and a dramatic reversal from his first term, when he drew international attention by cracking down on Chinese ‍access ‌to US technology. Back then, he cited claims that Beijing steals American intellectual property and harnesses commercially obtained technology to bolster its military, which Beijing denies.

Exporting large numbers of the chips to China would be ""a significant strategic mistake"", said Chris McGuire, a former White House National Security Council official under President Joe Biden and senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations.

McGuire described the chips as ""the one thing holding China back in AI"".

""I cannot possibly fathom how the departments of Commerce, State, Energy, and Defense could certify that exporting these chips to China is in ‌the US national security interest,” he said.

Led by White House AI czar David Sacks, several members of the Trump administration now argue that shipping advanced AI chips to China discourages Chinese competitors like Huawei from redoubling efforts to catch up with Nvidia's and AMD's most-advanced chip designs.

Reuters reported last week that Nvidia was considering an increase in production of the H200, the immediate predecessor to its current flagship Blackwell chips, after initial orders from China outstripped the current capacity.

While the H200 chips are slower than Nvidia's Blackwell chips at many AI tasks, they remain in wide use in the industry and have never been allowed for sale in China.

Trump had previously opened the door to sales of a less-advanced version of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, its cutting-edge offering, but backed away from the ‌move and approved sales of the H200 instead.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--qp2d4c8B--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-12-19T013853Z_1_LYNXMPELBI02N_RTROPTP_3_USA-CHINA-NVIDIA.JPG?itok=lZInAkcT",N,,2025-12-19 16:05:35.475525

While Nvidia wants to secure GPU demand from the next generation of AI applications, Alphabet’s CapitalG aims to push AI tools that could challenge traditional software monopolies.","Stockholm-based AI startup Lovable has some admirers, with two of them being tech heavyweights Nvidia and Google.

The vibe coding noob has closed a $330 million Series B funding round, catapulting the company to a healthy $6.6 billion valuation. This figure represents more than triple the company’s worth from five months ago, when it was valued at $1.8 billion following its July funding round. The round was led by CapitalG (Alphabet’s venture arm) and Menlo Ventures, with participation from Nvidia’s NVentures, creating an alliance of AI powerhouses.

Back in 2023, this Swedish startup was founded by Anton Osika and Fabian Hedin, and has since become one of the fastest-growing companies in tech history. Lovable reached $200 million in annual recurring revenue last month, achieving this milestone in under a year after hitting its first $1 million in ARR. With fresh funding exceeding $500 million raised in 2025 alone, Lovable is probably loving life.

I’m worth billions in prizes

Behind Lovable’s meteoric rise lies vibe coding—an approach that transforms simple text descriptions into fully functional applications. Users can generate complete websites or applications by typing casual prompts into a chatbot interface, with no coding knowledge required.

Numbers from the announcement reveal Lovable’s user base creates over 100,000 new applications daily, with more than 25 million projects built on the platform in its first year. Major enterprise customers including Klarna, Uber, and Zendesk are already using the platform, with some teams reducing development time from six weeks to just three hours.

Investment frenzy

The funding announcement signals a massive shift in how tech giants view AI development tools. Nvidia’s investment strategy focuses on backing startups it considers game changers and market makers to expand the AI ecosystem. The company has already participated in 50 venture capital deals this year, surpassing its entire 2024 activity.

Market data from earlier this quarter shows vibe coding exploding across the board. Combined valuations of leading startups in this space grew 350% year-over-year, jumping from roughly $7-8 billion in mid-2024 to over $36 billion in 2025. Competitor Cursor raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation last month, while Replit hit a $3 billion valuation in September.

Strategic positioning reveals competing interests converging around this Swedish startup. While Nvidia wants to secure GPU demand from the next generation of AI applications, Alphabet’s CapitalG aims to push AI tools that could challenge traditional software monopolies. When these competing tech giants agree on backing the same company, something transformative is clearly happening.

Sweet software development

The announcement arguably represents more than just another AI success story—it validates a fundamental shift in how software gets built. The company’s mission to become “the last piece of software” companies ever need to buy reflects growing demand for platforms that eliminate traditional development bottlenecks.

The platform addresses the global shortage of skilled programmers by transforming millions of non-technical users into developers. When you examine the implications, Lovable has transformed a latent market of tens of millions of people into developers.

Enterprise adoption signals are undeniable. Lovable’s demand from Fortune 500 companies signals a fundamental shift in how software gets built. The company plans to use its new funding to enhance collaboration and governance capabilities, add more third-party software integrations, and application hosting features.",https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2025/12/Love-2-Adobe.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 16:05:40.084690

About original equipment manufacturers

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are companies that design, manufacture, and sell complete vehicles under their own brand names. Because they bring complete vehicles to market, unlike component suppliers and aftermarket manufacturers, OEMs bear full regulatory responsibility for their products, meaning they must ensure compliance with safety standards, emission regulations, and other governmental requirements across their operating markets. The designation “original” reflects the fact that OEMs are primary brand owners and market-facing entities.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2649488227-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 14:02:14.662934

""With BioMarin's unwavering commitment to patients, along with greater resources and scale, Amicus' medicines will reach even more patients around the world, faster.

The boards of both companies unanimously approved the agreement, and Amicus' board of directors unanimously recommended that Amicus' stockholders vote to adopt the agreement.1

""Amicus, like BioMarin, is a company that has been profoundly dedicated to transforming care for patients with rare diseases since its founding, developing and bringing to market important therapies for individuals living with Fabry disease and Pompe disease. BioMarin's scale of operations, including our global commercial footprint and industry-leading, in-house manufacturing capabilities make the combination of these companies an exceptional strategic fit,"" said Alexander Hardy, president and chief executive officer of BioMarin.

What benefits will the acquisition bring BioMartin?

Amicus’ acquisition aims to strengthen BioMarin's commercial portfolio by adding two new treatments to the company's existing portfolio of medicines targeting lysosomal storage disorders, including Galafold, the first oral treatment for Fabry disease, and Pombiliti in combination with Opfolda , a two-component therapy for Pompe disease.1 Based on the recently announced Galafold litigation settlements, BioMartin is expected to have exclusivity for Galafold through January 2037.

BioMartin can also add DMX-200 (another treatment that Amicus has rights to in the U.S.). The drug is a potential first-in-class investigational small molecule for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a rare and fatal kidney disease currently in Phase III development.

The acquisition is also expected to increase BioMarin's long-term compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 and beyond, as both Galafold and Pombiliti plus Opfolda hold high-growth potential having generated a combined net product revenue of $599 million over the past four quarters.1

Following the closing of the agreement, it is expected to add revenue immediately, being accretive to Non-GAAP Diluted EPS in the initial 12 months after close, with substantial accretive beginning in 2027.1 Strengthening its cash flow generation and its commitment to deleveraging, BioMarin is targeting gross leverage above two and half times within two years after close.

""Immediately upon close, this transaction is expected to accelerate BioMarin's revenue growth and strengthen our financial outlook, delivering significant value to patients, employees and stockholders. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Non-GAAP Diluted EPS in the first 12 months following close,"" said Hardy.

What are the financial details of the agreement?

Per the terms of the agreement, BioMarin will acquire Amicus for a price of $14.50 per share, in an all-cash transaction, which represents a 33% premium to Amicus' last close, a 46% premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average stock price, and a 58% premium to the 60-day volume-weighted average stock price, for a total equity value of upwards of $4.8 billion.1

""I am enormously proud of our Amicus team. Together with our partners in the rare disease community, we created a truly patient-centric biotech and successfully developed two transformative medicines for people living with rare diseases, which impacted the lives of more than 3,400 patients around the world,"" said Bradley L. Campbell, president and chief executive officer of Amicus. ""With BioMarin's unwavering commitment to patients, along with greater resources and scale, Amicus' medicines will reach even more patients around the world, faster. We are confident that this agreement is in the best interests of our shareholders by providing compelling, certain and premium value, and will accelerate progress for the rare disease community.""

From the article:

IBM’s data strategy for the AI era included multiple changes to longstanding approaches, enabling it to build what (Vice President and Chief Data Officer Ed) Lovely calls an integrated enterprise data architecture. For example, the company retained the concept of data owners but “helped them understand that the data is an IBM asset, and if we’re able to democratize it in a controlled, secure way, we can run the business in a better, more productive way,” Lovely says.

As a result, IBM moved from multiple teams managing siloed data to a common team using common standards and common architectures. Enterprise leaders also consolidated 300 terabytes of data, selecting needed data based on the outcomes the company seeks and the workflows that drive those outcomes. ...

Rethink Data Ownership

“Traditional models that treat data ownership as a purely IT issue no longer work when business units, product teams, and AI platforms are all generating and transforming data continuously,” (research manager for IDC’s Global DataSphere) Adam Wright explains. “Ideally, clear accountability should sit with a senior data leader such as a CDO, but organizations without a CDO must ensure that data governance responsibilities are explicitly distributed across IT, security, and the business.”

It’s critical to have “a single point of authority for defining policies and a federated model for execution, so that business units remain empowered but not unchecked,” he adds.

The approval allows PLSE to begin a multicenter clinical trial evaluating its proprietary Nanosecond Pulsed Field Ablation (nsPFA) technology, marking an important regulatory milestone for the cardiac portfolio.

For investors, the IDE clearance de-risks the clinical pathway, builds on encouraging European feasibility data and positions PLSE to generate meaningful U.S. clinical evidence that could support broader adoption and future commercialization.

Likely Trend of PLSE Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, the company's shares closed flat at yesterday’s market closing. Shares of the company have lost 4.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s 16.4% growth. The S&P 500 has gained 14.8% in the same time frame.

Over the long run, the FDA IDE approval strengthens PLSE’s business by advancing its nPulse system toward U.S. commercialization in the fast-growing AF ablation market, while validating its differentiated nanosecond PFA technology versus competing microsecond-based systems. Successful execution of the study could generate pivotal clinical data to support regulatory approval, drive physician adoption and establish PLSE as a next-generation ablation platform with potential workflow, safety and durability advantages, ultimately expanding revenue opportunities.

PLSE currently has a market capitalization of $966.4 million.

More on the News

The FDA IDE approval enables Pulse Biosciences to formally launch its NANOPULSE-AF study, a single-arm, multicenter, prospective trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the nPulse Cardiac Catheter Ablation System in patients with recurrent, drug-resistant paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The study plans to enroll up to 145 patients across as many as 30 sites, including leading centers in the United States and three sites outside the country, giving PLSE broad geographic exposure and clinical diversity. The trial’s design aligns with regulatory expectations for early-stage cardiac device validation and represents a meaningful step forward in PLSE’s U.S. clinical strategy.

A key differentiator highlighted in the announcement is PLSE’s use of nanosecond pulsed field ablation, which delivers substantially lower total energy compared with traditional microsecond PFA systems. Management believes this approach may further reduce collateral damage to surrounding cardiac structures while maintaining effective lesion formation. The nPulse catheter is also engineered to create a complete circumferential pulmonary vein isolation lesion in a single energy application, eliminating the need for repeated repositioning and stacked lesions — an advantage that could simplify workflows, reduce procedure times and improve consistency in real-world EP labs.

Importantly, the IDE builds on encouraging clinical momentum in Europe, where PLSE’s ongoing feasibility study has already enrolled 150 patients with follow-up underway. Positive early outcomes from that experience provide real-world validation for the technology and help de-risk the U.S. study. With strong support from prominent electrophysiologists and plans to share follow-up data in 2026, PLSE is positioning its nsPFA platform as a next-generation ablation solution that could enhance safety, procedural efficiency and durability, key attributes that matter for long-term adoption and commercial success.

Favorable Industry Prospects for PLSE

Per a report by Grand View Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size was estimated at $26.89 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $65.33 billion by 2033, registering a CAGR of 10.44% from 2025 to 2033.

The atrial fibrillation market is driven by a growing disease burden, rapid technological evolution in treatment and diagnostics and the shift toward remote patient monitoring.

Other Recent Development for PLSE

Recently, PLSE announced that it initiated a research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to test its nPulse technology — Vybrance — for treating malignant thyroid tumors. The FDA has given approval for PLSE’s IDE application so they can commence human trials. The clinical trial is scheduled to begin in early 2026 and will enroll 30 patients across two sites.

This data center project is part of the Stargate data center project by OpenAI and Oracle, which aims to deliver more than 5GW of computing capacity.
This move meant that DTE Energy did not have to go through a lengthy hearing, wherein opposing groups could seek expert testimony and present evidence to challenge DTE’s claims.
This ready-to-serve provision in the power agreement helps ensure the power utility’s expenditure on additional infrastructure to support the AI data center will not be passed on to the average consumer.
Furthermore, if the data center fails to pay for its energy costs, DTE cannot pass them on to other consumers.","The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has given DTE Energy permission to deliver 1.4 gigawatts of power to a planned data center that will be built in Saline Township, about 40 miles southwest of downtown Detroit. This data center project is part of the Stargate data center project by OpenAI and Oracle, which aims to deliver more than 5GW of computing capacity. According to the Detroit Free Press, DTE filed an “ex parte” motion with the MPSC to get the nod for its contract without contest, with the commission voting 3-0 for its approval.

This move meant that DTE Energy did not have to go through a lengthy hearing, wherein opposing groups could seek expert testimony and present evidence to challenge DTE’s claims. Many residents are concerned that this massive project would cause electricity prices to spike and affect the water quality in the area — issues that several U.S. senators are also looking into. On the other hand, the utility company argued that it didn’t need to prove that this project would affect energy prices for local residents, especially as a 2024 state law prevents data centers from passing on energy costs to the community to qualify for preferential tax treatment.

Aside from this, DTE’s contract with Green Chile Ventures, an Oracle subsidiary, requires that the latter will pay 80% of the contracted capacity, whether or not it actually uses it. This ready-to-serve provision in the power agreement helps ensure the power utility’s expenditure on additional infrastructure to support the AI data center will not be passed on to the average consumer. The contract will also last for at least 19 years, giving the power provider ample time to recoup its expenses from the data center and not from the community. Furthermore, if the data center fails to pay for its energy costs, DTE cannot pass them on to other consumers.

Despite these mechanisms, opponents of the plan were still dismayed about not being heard. “I, along with everyone here… probably don’t feel like they’ve been publicly served today. When you make these decisions, you’re eliminating the very necessity of what public service bodies are all about,” Wendy Albers, a resident of nearby Augusta Township, told the MPSC. “I appreciate the protections you put in place, but I just don’t trust them.”",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dGxeQZ7bfxsrBwxMCC4r7N-1920-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:02:11.937698

Customers deserve stronger, more connected freight rail, and our merger will make that happen.” Mark George, president and CEO of Norfolk Southern, said, ““This combination will bring together Union Pacific’s expansive Western reach and Norfolk Southern’s unparalleled access to Eastern manufacturing and population centers in an end-to-end combination.
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, US, Norfolk Southern moved 18,107 carloads of grain and grain mill products in 2024, according to its weekly performance reports.
If a merger does occur, grain shippers could benefit from single-line service, the USDA noted.

The railroads first announced they had entered into a merger agreement on July 29, and the board of directors of both companies unanimously approved the transaction. It is subject to STB review and approval within its statutory timeline. The companies are targeting early 2027 for closure.

“We look forward to working with the Surface Transportation Board as it reviews our historic application to create America’s first transcontinental railroad,” said Jim Vena, chief executive officer of UP, based in Omaha, Nebraska, US. “As time and technology continue to transform how freight is delivered, our industry must keep pace and move forward, reaching underserved markets with new rail solutions and strengthening the US supply chain. Customers deserve stronger, more connected freight rail, and our merger will make that happen.”

Mark George, president and CEO of Norfolk Southern, said, ““This combination will bring together Union Pacific’s expansive Western reach and Norfolk Southern’s unparalleled access to Eastern manufacturing and population centers in an end-to-end combination. It will create a cohesive freight rail solution with 50,000 route miles that connect 43 states and more than 100 ports.”

Union Pacific transports about 1.3 billion bushels of grain annually, with exports accounting for 30% to 40% of those shipments, according to the company. The railroad serves most of the US major grain markets, connecting the Midwest and Western production areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast, as well as Mexico. It also serves significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders and ethanol producers in the Midwest and West.

Based in Atlanta, Georgia, US, Norfolk Southern moved 18,107 carloads of grain and grain mill products in 2024, according to its weekly performance reports. Agriculture products shipped include soybeans, wheat, corn, feed, flour and ethanol.

Faster, more comprehensive freight service to US shippers by eliminating interchange delays, opening new routes, expanding intermodal services, and reducing distance and transit time on key rail corridors are key components of the merger, the companies said.

The US Class I rail network is divided so that no single railroad reaches from the East Coast to the West Coast. Cross-continental rail traffic must interchange between railroads, and Chicago, Illinois, US, is the main interchange point, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

If a merger does occur, grain shippers could benefit from single-line service, the USDA noted. However, the combination also could result in less competition where merging railroads overlap.

Novo Nordisk on Thursday said it filed an application for U.S. approval of CagriSema, its weekly injectable for obesity. Earlier this year, the Danish drugmaker disappointed investors when the drug, a combination of an amylin-targeting medicine and semaglutide, missed the mark in a closely watched late-stage study. Still, its application is based on data from that trial, which found that patients shed an average of 23% of their body weight over 68 weeks, as well as a secondary study. Novo hopes to position CagriSema as a follow-up to the success of Wegovy, and to take the edge off the threat of its competitor Eli Lilly, which recently submitted an application for approval of its oral GLP-1 orforglipron. It would be the first amylin-targeting and GLP-1 combination on the market if approved. — Gwendolyn Wu

Camp4 Therapeutics, an RNA-targeting biotechnology company, has inked a deal with GSK worth as much as $440 million to make medicines for neurodegenerative and kidney diseases. In a Thursday announcement, Camp4 said GSK would hand over $17.5 million in upfront costs, and could pay tiered royalties if any of the programs that emerge from the collaboration are commercialized. The partnership is focused on antisense oligonucleotide drugs that boost gene expression, which could be beneficial in genetic disorders caused by loss of function. Camp4 also announced the pricing of a $30 million public stock offering on Thursday. — Gwendolyn Wu

A San Francisco-based AI drugmaker, Chai Discovery, has raised $130 million in a Series B financing to support its ambitions of speeding up the drugmaking process. The company claims its technology can predict how biochemical molecules interact with one another and find new ways to pursue “hard-to-drug” targets. Its investor syndicate included Oak HC/FT and General Catalyst, which co-led the round, as well as others such as Thrive Capital, OpenAI and Yosemite. Chai raised its $70 million Series A funding just four months ago. — Gwendolyn Wu

A combination of Merck & Co.’s immunotherapy Keytruda and the Pfizer/Astellas antibody-drug conjugate Padcev succeeded in another bladder cancer study, helping people who are otherwise eligible for chemotherapy live longer than those who got chemo, the companies said Wednesday. Trial enrollees had muscle-invasive bladder cancer that hadn’t spread outside the bladder, and were undergoing surgery with curative intent. Participants were randomized to receive either Keytruda and Padcev before and after surgery or platinum-based chemo before surgery. Trial investigators then measured event-free survival, overall survival and remission rates. Beyond stating that the Keytruda-Padcev combination had a “statistically significant and clinically meaningful” benefit on those three measures, the companies didn’t release specifics but said they will disclose data at a coming medical meeting. The combination has also improved survival for those who can’t receive chemotherapy as well as those whose disease spread beyond the bladder. — Jonathan Gardner",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/EK5xKj0ydykvmwFmBqsauREtdhrHAUsAiyI6JgDkO1s/g:nowe:0:0/c:1207:682/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDgzOTIxNzkzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-19 14:02:01.585346

The decision comes after VRG50635, the company’s lead asset for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), failed a pre-specified efficacy analysis in a phase 1 trial, Effie Bruzik, Verge’s vice president of operations, told Fierce Biotech.

“A no-go decision was made,” Bruzik said, so the trial was terminated and did not advance to an open-label extension stage. On clinicaltrials.gov, the reason given for the termination is “lack of risk-benefit data.”

The move away from VRG50635 leaves a preexisting deal with Ferrer in limbo. The Spanish pharma licensed the ex-U.S. rights to the ALS asset in March 2024 in a pact potentially worth more than 112.5 million euros (then worth roughly $121.7 million).

Bruzik did not respond to questions from Fierce Biotech about the status of Verge’s deal with Ferrer. At the time of publication, Ferrer had not responded to Fierce's request for comment.

With no more candidates in the clinic, Verge is pivoting to focus solely on its machine learning drug discovery platform Converge, Bruzik added.

“Recent breakthroughs in AI foundation models has meaningfully increased demand for Verge’s multi-modal human datasets in the last 18 months, and we see a clear opportunity to drive industry-wide impact by enabling partners to improve pipeline success rates,” Bruzik said.

Verge intends to use a “leaner cost structure” and continued investment in its technology to scale up Converge as a means to achieve “sustainable profitability,” Bruzik explained. The company plans to divulge more details on the “strategic re-focus,” including new hires, early next year, she said.

VRG50635 itself was originally discovered with Converge, and the tech company’s success at bringing an AI-discovered candidate into the clinic earned Verge a spot on the Fierce 15 list in 2022.

ID28,Levi Strauss,2025-12-19 16:04:39+00:00,Technology Record | The best of enterprise solutions from the Microsoft partner ecosystem,How Microsoft is helping businesses turn AI and data into real-world impact,Alice Chambers,,,,,https://www.technologyrecord.com/article/how-microsoft-is-helping-businesses-turn-ai-and-data-into-real-world-impact,"In agriculture, Land O’Lakes, a farmer-owned cooperative, built its Oz assistant on models within Azure AI Foundry to provide fast, accurate, mobile-friendly responses to agricultural questions.
These companies aren’t just deploying tools, they are embedding intelligence into every workflow, decision and process to amplify insight across their business.” Microsoft identifies four key trends that set frontier companies apart from others.
The company built Ask Ralph, an AI-powered conversational styling companion using Azure AI.
“With the Microsoft AI tools, we put a lot of power in the hands of our employees.
“In financial services, for example, we’re helping partners like BlackRock modernise operations by re-architecting its Aladdin platform on Azure AI,” says Taylor.","When a client requests an urgent fund transfer, financial advisors need instant access to account details and approvals, as delays can affect revenue and client trust. The same urgency applies to farmers, who must decide the optimal time to harvest to maximise yields, and to warehouse operators, who rely on real-time insights to manage stock and keep supply chains flowing. In every sector, speed, accuracy and actionable data – and the intelligence to interpret it – are more than just operational concerns, they are key to organisations achieving a competitive edge in fast-moving markets.

“Across every industry, generative and agentic AI are deriving insights from data and redefining how organisations operate, compete and grow,” says Alysa Taylor, chief marketing officer for commercial cloud and AI at Microsoft.

In finance, investment banking firm UBS is innovating with AI through its Smart Technologies and Advanced Analytics Team (STAAT), which combines advanced data analytics with machine learning to power intelligent insights. Built on Microsoft Azure, STAAT Assist automatically extracts key client information and populates transfer requests, enabling advisors to review and approve them with a single click, surfacing opportunities and speeding up the client experience. In agriculture, Land O’Lakes, a farmer-owned cooperative, built its Oz assistant on models within Azure AI Foundry to provide fast, accurate, mobile-friendly responses to agricultural questions. Meanwhile, American clothing firm Levi Strauss & Co. is using an Azure-native orchestrator agent embedded in Microsoft Teams to coordinate multiple subagents, enabling employees across corporate, retail and warehouse environments to access fast, accurate answers to questions like ‘what are the upcoming corporate holidays?’, ‘what is the travel and expense policy?’ and eventually ‘how do I process a return for an online order?’.

“These are examples of what we call ‘frontier firms’,” says Taylor. “They are organisations blending human ambition with AI-first innovation to maximise their potential and impact on society. These companies aren’t just deploying tools, they are embedding intelligence into every workflow, decision and process to amplify insight across their business.”

Microsoft identifies four key trends that set frontier companies apart from others.

“First, they empower employees to automate repetitive work so they can focus on creativity and strategy,” explains Taylor. “Second, they reimagine customer engagement through personalised, data-driven experiences. Third, they transform business processes for greater accuracy, speed and efficiency. Fourth, they accelerate innovation by bringing new product and experiences to market faster.”

One practical example comes from Lucerne Cantonal Hospital in Switzerland. Working with Microsoft and partner Polypoint, the hospital built an AI-powered shift-scheduling solution within Teams to cut planning time by two-thirds and free up caregivers to focus on patient care. Before the solution, nurses described creating monthly schedules for three daily shifts, seven days a week as “a game of Tetris”, where moving one cell triggered a cascade of adjustments.

More than 100 nurses spent two to three days each month organising these schedules. With AI handling the planning, staff now have time to provide better patient care and manage their teams more effectively.

“We have too few nurses and too much work, so if there is a way to give time back to the nurses, we want to do it,” says Michael Döring, the hospital’s chief nursing officer.

Frontier firms like Lucerne Cantonal Hospital are seeing measurable results, achieving up to three times higher returns from AI investments than late adopters, according to Taylor.

“This isn’t just about efficiency, it’s about unlocking new markets, business models and revenue streams,” she says. “AI is transforming how organisations engage with customers through personalisation at unprecedented scale. Ralph Lauren is a powerful example. The company built Ask Ralph, an AI-powered conversational styling companion using Azure AI. It delivers real-time outfit recommendations, styling tips and gift ideas, turning every customer interaction into a data driven, high-margin engagement that deepens loyalty and drives new revenue opportunities.”

German automotive manufacturer Mercedes Benz is using Azure AI to optimise its global production network across more than 30 plants.

“Innovation is deeply rooted in our DNA and fast forward to today, AI for us is our best colleague,” said Daniela Dimitrova, chief information officer at Mercedes, at Microsoft Ignite 2025. “With the Microsoft AI tools, we put a lot of power in the hands of our employees. We are bringing AI to the factory floor so we can analyse production data and improve efficiency across our factories.”

For example, Mercedes employees are alerted when there is a decrease in efficiency and can ask Digital Factory Chat, a self-serve platform to investigate the cause and analyse potential machine malfunctions. By deploying the AI solution, Mercedes reduced energy consumption by more than 20 per cent.

Mercedes is not alone in realising these kinds of gains; organisations across different sectors are accelerating similar outcomes and entering new markets with the support of Microsoft partners.

“Our partner ecosystem is the force multiplier,” says Taylor. “Partners design and build AI apps and agents, stand up secure data foundations, deploy and manage solutions at scale, and co-sell through our programmes and marketplace so customers realise value faster. That end-to-end motion – from advising on strategy to operating the solution – is how customers move from pilots to production and unlock new growth.”

For example, in the highly regulated life sciences sector, pharmaceutical company Hetero needed more than a basic infrastructure upgrade – it required a secure, scalable foundation that could support AI-driven insights and streamline complex quality and compliance processes. Working closely with Hetero and its subsidiary Audree Infotech, Cloud4C deployed a cloud-native architecture on Azure, addressing long-standing challenges around data fragmentation, manual reporting and operational bottlenecks.

The new architecture gave Hetero a single environment capable of supporting advanced analytics, automation and real-time decision making across 11 manufacturing plants. By modernising its core systems and introducing AI-powered workflows for root cause analysis and quality control, Hetero has cut infrastructure costs by 40 per cent, automated more than 4,000 documents each month and saved 13,500 working hours.

“Cloud4C’s work with Hetero is a clear example of partner-led transformation that improves operations and creates headroom to enter new markets,” says Taylor.

Hetero’s shift to a unified cloud architecture demonstrates the first step every organisation must take in bringing data into one governed, accessible environment so AI can generate meaningful impact.

“We’re starting to see a new set of technology patterns take shape across every sector,” says Taylor. “They’re not tied to a single product or workflow but to a fundamental shift in how organisations operate. The companies leading in this era of frontier firms aren’t just experimenting with AI; they’re embedding it into every workflow, decision and product.

“They’ve shifted from running IT to running intelligence. Cloud and AI are no longer technology choices; they’re becoming the business model itself. That’s exactly what Microsoft Foundry was designed for. It’s a unified Azure platform-as-a-service that brings together everything organisations need to build, customise and deploy AI solutions at scale.

Foundry enables teams to design and manage intelligent applications and agents that unlock insights from data, generate meaning at scale and continuously improve through iteration.”

Working with Foundry, Microsoft Fabric was built to break down siloed data and provide organisations with a single, unified view across all operations.

“At its core is OneLake, a logical data lake that provides a consistent, secure foundation for discovery, sharing and policy enforcement, enabling teams to collaborate on one trusted source of truth,” says Taylor.

Fabric also integrates a range of database services – including Azure HorizonDB, Azure DocumentDB, SQL Database and Cosmos DB – so organisations can run workloads across hybrid and multi-cloud environments without switching platforms. And with Azure Copilot, teams can manage specialised agents across the cloud lifecycle, streamlining AI-powered workflows and data-driven insights so products move from concept to market more efficiently.

Customers can use Microsoft’s broad library of AI models – from Microsoft, OpenAI, Hugging Face, Meta and Anthropic – to build customer copilots, autonomous agents or enhance their apps.

“This is all about deepening our commitment to bringing the best infrastructure, model choice and applications to our customers,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, when speaking about the addition of Anthropic’s Claude to Foundry. Now, Azure is the only hyperscaler to offer both OpenAI and Anthropic models to empower organisations to build the best possible AI applications. Across industries, Microsoft ensures its AI solutions meet the specific challenges and regulatory requirements each sector faces.

“These technology patterns – unified cloud foundations, secure AI integration and domain-specific copilots – are repeatable across industries,” says Taylor. “Whether in healthcare, manufacturing or retail, we help organisations apply the same architecture to streamline supply chains, ensure compliance and accelerate innovation. By tailoring our approach to each industry’s unique needs, we enable companies to deploy AI responsibly at scale while driving measurable business impact.

“In financial services, for example, we’re helping partners like BlackRock modernise operations by re-architecting its Aladdin platform on Azure AI,” says Taylor. “Aladdin Copilot allows analysts and portfolio managers to query complex financial data in natural language and get immediate, actionable insights, all within a secure, fully governed workflow that meets strict compliance requirements.”

The AI pattern for BlackRock integrates model reasoning, data orchestration and compliance checks within a single, governed workflow, ensuring every insight meets strict financial regulations. This means financial services professionals can get accurate replies when asking questions like ‘what is my exposure to companies building AI processors?’. For Microsoft, the real opportunity isn’t just using AI but about embedding intelligence into the DNA of a business.

“That’s when transformation truly happens,” explains Taylor. “It’s how organisations unlock new value, reshape processes and set the pace for what’s next. And this is exactly where our partners play a critical role. They bring deep industry expertise and an understanding of each customer’s unique challenges, helping them apply AI in ways that create measurable impact. Together, we’re not just deploying technology, we’re helping every organisation reimagine what’s possible and build the future of their industry.”

Partner perspectives

Three Microsoft partners share how they are helping customers leverage Microsoft technologies and AI tools to unlock new markets, create innovative products and reach audiences more effectively

“At Cisco, we’re enabling our customers to unlock new value by integrating advanced AI and Microsoft technologies into every workspace,” says Snorre Kjesbu, senior vice president and general manager of collaboration at Cisco. “With innovations like RoomOS 26 and our partnership on the Microsoft Device Ecosystem Platform, organisations can harness secure, AI-powered collaboration across Microsoft Teams Rooms and Webex.”

“The Public Key Infrastructure industry is undergoing massive change,” says John Murray, vice president of sales for the Americas at GMO GlobalSign. “To prepare for it, GlobalSign customers are shifting from traditional certificate payment models to new options such as subject alternative name (SAN) licensing. We use Copilot to help quickly and accurately summarise unique SAN values per certificate, replacing time-consuming pivot table work and enabling precise license recommendations.”

“At Intermedia, we’re helping organisations get more from their Microsoft investments by unifying communication and collaboration into one intelligent experience,” says Mark Sher, senior vice president or product marketing at Intermedia. “Our Intermedia Intelligent Communications platform, Unite, integrates with Microsoft Teams so users can connect with customers and colleagues through high-quality voice, SMS and contact centre interactions without leaving Teams.”",https://www.technologyrecord.com/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/6754/TechnologyRecord-outnow-spread-975x548-1-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:04:51.362961

The mixed verdict came after almost eight hours of deliberation, following a three-day trial.
The charges stem from Feb. 22, when hundreds of people gathered in the CHS auditorium for a legislative town hall organized by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee.
Defense counsel for Trouette argued that he could not have committed any crimes by touching or detaining town hall attendees because he was acting at the sheriff's behest.
Forsgren testified that she was leaving the town hall when she saw Trouette and two other men drag Borrenpohl into the hallway.","COEUR d'ALENE — A Kootenai County jury found that security company owner Paul Trouette battered two people who spoke out when a woman was dragged from a chaotic legislative town hall at Coeur d'Alene High School, but committed no crimes against the woman herself.

The six-person jury voted unanimously Thursday to convict Trouette of two counts of battery against Gregg Johnson and Sarah Forsgren, as well as security agent uniform and duties violations, all misdemeanors.

Jurors found Trouette not guilty of two additional counts of battery against Teresa Borrenpohl and Ben Stallings. They also acquitted him of two counts of false imprisonment related to his detainment of Borrenpohl and Johnson during the town hall. The mixed verdict came after almost eight hours of deliberation, following a three-day trial.

""Justice was done,"" said Ryan Hunter, chief deputy prosecutor for the city of Coeur d'Alene.

Trouette and his attorney hurried out of the courtroom after hearing the verdict. They declined to comment.

The charges stem from Feb. 22, when hundreds of people gathered in the CHS auditorium for a legislative town hall organized by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee.

Defense counsel for Trouette argued that he could not have committed any crimes by touching or detaining town hall attendees because he was acting at the sheriff's behest. In Idaho, sheriffs have the authority to command citizens to aid them in the execution of their duties.

Prosecutors contended that this immunity did not apply to Trouette because Norris gave him no specific commands to remove or detain anyone.

Witnesses said the atmosphere was tense as the event got underway, with people in the audience cheering, jeering and speaking out of turn in response to legislators.

Ben Stallings testified that Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris directed him to leave the auditorium after he spoke out of turn. He complied, but when he paused to wait for his visually-impaired wife, he said Trouette and another security guard put their hands on him.

Trouette and three employees of his business, Lear Asset Management, provided security services for the event. No contract existed between the company and the KCRCC; instead, Trouette said, he provided the services on a volunteer basis.

Prosecutors said Trouette violated city ordinances requiring him to have a contract authorizing him to perform security work on behalf of a third party and to wear a uniform clearly identifying him as a security guard. Trouette and the other security personnel wore plainclothes during the event and never identified themselves as security when attendees asked who they were.

Video recordings showed Norris approached Borrenpohl after she spoke out of turn and told her to leave the event. When she refused, he took hold of her arm and tried to pull her from her seat, then threatened to pepper-spray her. He then directed security personnel to remove her.

The men hauled Borrenpohl from her seat and wrestled her to the ground. One sat on top of her, while another knelt on her back. She said they twisted her limbs and pulled her hair.

""It was incredibly painful,"" she testified this week. ""I was just trying to keep my airway open.""

With Trouette's help, the men dragged Borrenpohl out of the auditorium by her arms as many people cheered. She lost her shoes, and her shirt came up, fully exposing her bra.

Johnson, who rose from his seat near Borrenpohl and stepped aside at Norris' direction, told the court he was alarmed to see the men force Borrenpohl to the ground.

""Hey, leave her alone,"" he said.

Norris said those words ""encouraged"" Borrenpohl to ""keep resisting,"" so he grabbed Johnson and threatened to arrest him. He marched Johnson out of the auditorium, soon joined by Trouette. The pair pushed Johnson against a wall, kicked his legs to force them open and restrained his hands behind his back.

Forsgren testified that she was leaving the town hall when she saw Trouette and two other men drag Borrenpohl into the hallway. She said she told the men to get their hands off Borrenpohl.

That was when Trouette approached her. Video footage showed him pushing her into a wall. The two struggled briefly as Trouette appeared to try to turn Forsgren around to restrain her hands.

Hunter said he believes the jury put considerable thought and effort into reaching their decision.

""I'd be hard-pressed to say I'm not a little disappointed,"" he said. ""I'm mostly disappointed for the victims named in the not guilty verdict. At the same time, I respect the jury's verdict.""

The jury's decision, while mixed, was a victory for prosecutors.

""This is a good outcome,"" Hunter said.

Sentencing in the case will take place at a later date. The combined charges carry a maximum possible sentence of two years in jail and fines of up to $4,000.",https://hagadone.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/12/18/PaulTrouette_t1200x630.JPG?b488907419a4f4bb2699a58f7dac3d0615975bd7,N,,2025-12-19 13:01:56.177163

GPT-5.2-Codex is designed to perform tasks that normally require a lot of time and human coordination.
Thanks to context compaction, GPT-5.2-Codex can execute multi-step processes without losing track.
GPT-5.2-Codex can interpret screenshots, technical diagrams, and user interfaces more accurately and translate that information into working code.
On benchmarks that measure realistic software development, such as SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, GPT-5.2-Codex achieves the highest scores to date, according to OpenAI.","OpenAI has released GPT-5.2-Codex, a new version of its agentic AI model for software development that focuses specifically on professional software engineering and cybersecurity.

The model builds on GPT-5.2 but has been further optimized to work independently within complex development environments. With this release, OpenAI is positioning Codex not just as a programming assistant but as a broader support technology for the entire software development process.

GPT-5.2-Codex is designed to perform tasks that normally require a lot of time and human coordination. The model can analyze, modify, and maintain large codebases, while summarizing relevant context concisely to continue working consistently over time. This makes it suitable for refactoring, migrations, and other major code changes that often occur in enterprise environments.

According to OpenAI, the model can improve existing applications without adding new functionality, for example by reducing memory usage or optimizing performance.

GPT-5.2-Codex can perform multi-step processes

An important technical difference from previous Codex versions is its improved handling of long and complex tasks. Thanks to context compaction, GPT-5.2-Codex can execute multi-step processes without losing track. Integration with development tools and terminals has also been further refined, making the model more reliable in realistic development scenarios. In addition, explicit attention has been paid to better support for Windows environments, a frequently cited limitation of previous AI development tools.

OpenAI also emphasizes the model’s improved visual capabilities. GPT-5.2-Codex can interpret screenshots, technical diagrams, and user interfaces more accurately and translate that information into working code. This makes it possible to convert software designs and mockups into functional prototypes more quickly, which is particularly relevant for teams in which design and development work closely together.

Cybersecurity is a central part of the announcement. OpenAI states that advances in programming logic and reasoning directly translate into better support for security research.

Earlier this year, a security researcher used an earlier version of Codex to analyze a known React vulnerability. During that process, several new security vulnerabilities were discovered, which were then responsibly reported. According to OpenAI, examples like these show how AI can help accelerate defensive security work, such as bug detection, testing, and mitigation.

At the same time, OpenAI acknowledges that these capabilities also carry risks. That is why the company has opted for a controlled rollout. GPT-5.2-Codex is now available to paying ChatGPT users via the Codex CLI and IDE extensions, among others. Access via the API will be expanded in phases. In addition, OpenAI is launching an invitation program for trusted security professionals, focused on defensive applications within cybersecurity.

On benchmarks that measure realistic software development, such as SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, GPT-5.2-Codex achieves the highest scores to date, according to OpenAI. This underscores the company’s claim that the model is not only theoretically stronger, but also performs better in practice on real development and management tasks.",https://www.techzine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2463475985.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:02:18.119217

Wall Street could be missing opportunities to gauge executive sentiment toward AI, and with it potential signals about corporate demand for the technology.","Wall Street is asking technology companies a lot of questions about how artificial intelligence is being developed and financed. It’s showing less curiosity about how other companies are using it, even as business customers in the US alone spent $86 billion this year on AI systems.

Fewer than half the companies in the S&P 500 Index received questions from analysts about generative AI on earnings calls in 2025, according to an analysis of call transcripts by Bloomberg News. In the most recent quarter, when more than 80% of tech companies in the index were asked about AI, the topic was put to just under a third of S&P 500 companies overall.

The scant questions about AI may come as a surprise three years into a $30 trillion bull run for the S&P 500, the start of which coincided with the debut of ChatGPT. The release of the OpenAI chatbot invited stark predictions that AI would revolutionize office work, customer service and other business operations.

“I’m shocked anybody can host an earnings call and not talk about it right now or not be asked about it by an investor,” said Heath Terry, global head of technology and communications research at Citigroup Inc. “To me it’s one of — if not the most important question — that you should be asking a company because if they don’t have a strategy for this, they’re probably going to get left behind.”

Bloomberg’s review of more than 7,000 earnings call transcripts, performed with the help of a large-language model, tallied questions about AI meant to mimic or augment human abilities to think, reason, solve problems, make decisions or complete complex tasks. The analysis excluded questions about factory automation, self-driving vehicles, and leases or funding for data centers.

Energy and utility providers — along with select industrials, materials companies and real estate firms — are getting questions about how they’ll profit from the massive infrastructure investments required to power and house new AI capacity. But these companies are rarely pressed by analysts on how they’re using AI themselves.

Management teams in sectors including finance and real estate are starting to get more questions about their AI strategies. But that line of inquiry remains rare.

Typically on earnings calls, analysts prioritize what they consider to be the biggest or most immediate concerns for the companies they follow.

Outside of tech, AI “doesn’t really matter that much, it’s not big enough to move the needle,” said Ohsung Kwon, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo & Co.

That may change, though.

In a recent Bloomberg Intelligence survey of more than 600 senior executives from large companies across nine sectors, predictions for a high degree of disruption from AI came from every industry represented in the poll. And respondents from five sectors — financial services, media and cable, hospitals, pharmaceuticals and telecoms — said the impact of AI would include a “high” or “very high” near-term rise in operating costs.

Excluding firms that are building the AI industry, US companies spent an estimated $86 billion on the technology in 2025, according to Rick Villars, vice president at market research firm IDC. Next year, that sum is expected to surge to $131 billion.

Analysts are asking the architects of the AI industry, who are spending many times that amount to build the technology, to demonstrate a path to financial returns on their investment. On calls with companies in other sectors, however, they often seem to be searching for use cases.

Most AI discussion, when it comes up during the question-and-answer portion of earnings calls for non-tech companies, relates to adoption and development. Some analysts are asking about expected returns and spending plans tied to AI. Management, meanwhile, is more likely to bring up productivity gains associated with the technology.

Wall Street could be missing opportunities to gauge executive sentiment toward AI, and with it potential signals about corporate demand for the technology. As veterans of the dot-com bust remember, information from users can help investors judge the correct pace and scale for the expansion of a new technology.

“The internet ultimately was game changing, but what caused the bubble to grow and then burst was there was too much investment too fast. People weren’t adopting the tech quickly enough,” said Bloomberg Intelligence equity strategist Gillian Wolff.

The same danger exists with AI, she said. “Not that it won’t ultimately be game changing, but that there could be too much investment right now and investors are going to demand ROI faster than people are willing to adopt — that’s probably the biggest risk.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-wall-street-ai-questions-beyond-tech/img/social_gfx.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 17:02:13.359105

That same day, The Leader posted a story on their Facebook about Senedd (The Welsh Parliament) politicians getting a £12,000 pay increase. This received a meagre 84 comments of outrage in comparison.

How strange?

'Who are the real scroungers?'

My 40-year-old friend, whom I won't name, has been on Universal Credit for three months. Whilst still actively looking for work, he has been struggling financially.

He lives near Chester Zoo, is a Flintshire local, and described the reaction as 'mental'.

""I'm not sure what the problem is?"" he said.

""If they're online complaining about less fortunate kids going to the zoo, they've got too much time on their hands. Access to places like Chester Zoo isn’t just leisure; it’s educational, cultural, and supports children’s development.

""UC often leaves families with very little disposable income after rent and bills. A day out at the zoo could be impossible without support.""

Of his own experiences on Universal Credit, he told me: ""The main thing is, as a person living on my bill, I get just under £720 a month, and my rent is £625. I have to go to regular meetings and demonstrate that I'm applying for jobs.

""With papers like The Daily Mail avoiding millions of tax a year and not paying their share, it's very rich how they attack people. Who are the real scroungers?

""Private schools enjoy tax‑funded privileges far greater than any UC claimant. Why are they paying less tax than public schools?""

Universal Credit myths

Many of the comments on the Facebook post seemed to convey the same general sentiment here and there.

Let's take a closer look at them.

“People on benefits are unemployed"" No, over 40% of Universal Credit claimants are in work.

""People choose to be on benefits"" No, as my friend demonstrated, Universal Credit is well below the poverty line; who'd want to be on that?

""Claiming benefits is easy"" No, the PIP or ESA process is an extremely lengthy one. A lot of people who should have a right to the benefit are often rejected.

""People need to budget better"" No, despite what 50p Lee (Anderson) claims, the cost of living has shot up by 22% in the last four years. Making it extremely hard for people in general to get by, let alone people on benefits.

The bean soup theory truly is a depressing reality. ""We're letting kids in for £1, ""BUT WHAT ABOUT ME I'M 78!""

Hang Lung Properties, the blue‑chip landlord that owns Fashion Walk, declined to comment on individual leasing matters.
Since 2021, however, H&M has streamlined its Hong Kong footprint from 13 stores to three: Fashion Walk in Causeway Bay, Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong and Tsuen Wan Plaza.

The Swedish fashion group said it remains committed to the Hong Kong market, will continue serving customers online at hm.com, and is actively exploring new, suitable locations while optimising its retail network.

In a statement attributable to an H&M spokesperson, the company said: “Due to the expiration of our lease agreement, H&M’s Fashion Walk store in Hong Kong will officially close on 21st February, 2026. We remain committed to the Hong Kong market and will actively explore new and suitable locations to serve our customers locally while gradually optimising our retail network. Our customers will continue finding the best H&M has to offer in our stores in Hong Kong or shop online at hm.com.”

Positioning Hong Kong as a key city within the Greater Bay Area (GBA), H&M said it will upgrade its GBA presence through an enhanced store portfolio delivering elevated product offerings and brand experiences tailored to local customers. “Looking ahead, H&M will continue to accelerate its growth across Greater China, including Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, by opening new stores in key cities and locations, upgrading high‑potential existing stores — such as the Shenzhen 1234 Space renovation this summer — and optimising our store network for long‑term profitability and relevance,” the spokesperson added.

Market sources indicate the Causeway Bay premises, historically one of H&M’s most prominent Asian locations, will be subdivided and re‑let. Local health and beauty group Lung Fung is understood to be in advanced talks for about 10,000 square feet on the ground floor at a reported monthly rent above HK$1.2 million, with the basement and upper floors to be marketed separately. Hang Lung Properties, the blue‑chip landlord that owns Fashion Walk, declined to comment on individual leasing matters.

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.64 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for U.S. Bancorp has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.

Comparing U.S. Bancorp's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro, U.S. Bancorp's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 0.80%, which means the company has more short interest than most of its peers.

Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

GPT-5.2-Codex is now available for paid ChatGPT subscribers.","OpenAI has released GPT-5.2-Codex, a groundbreaking advancement in AI-driven software engineering and defensive cybersecurity.

This new model represents a significant leap forward in agentic capabilities, designed to handle complex, long-horizon tasks that previously required sustained human oversight.

The most advanced coding model to date, GPT-5.2-Codex, is optimized for developers and security researchers working on extended projects.

Unlike earlier iterations that excelled only at short code snippets, this version maintains context through entire workflows.

The model uses context compaction technology to preserve memory across long sessions, enabling it to handle large-scale code refactors, migrations, and feature implementations without losing focus on core objectives.

Enhanced Performance and Capabilities

GPT-5.2-Codex demonstrates exceptional performance on industry-leading benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0.

The model also features improved support for Windows environments and significantly stronger vision capabilities.

These enhancements enable the AI to interpret technical diagrams, UI screenshots, and architectural documentation to automatically generate functional prototypes.

The architecture’s ability to understand complex visual inputs makes it particularly valuable for security professionals analyzing system designs and threat landscapes.

This visual comprehension extends beyond simple screenshots to include a comprehensive interpretation of technical documentation.

Revolutionary Impact on Vulnerability Research

The most significant advancement lies in cybersecurity applications. OpenAI reports substantial improvements in threat detection and vulnerability analysis capabilities.

A real-world case study illustrates this potential: security engineer Andrew MacPherson from Privy used GPT-5.1-Codex-Max to investigate the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182).

By guiding the AI agent through standard defensive workflows, including setting up a local test environment and fuzzing for malformed inputs, MacPherson’s team uncovered previously unknown vulnerabilities in React Server Components.

These discoveries were responsibly disclosed to the React development team.

GPT-5.2-Codex significantly strengthens these capabilities. The model achieves substantially higher accuracy in professional Capture-the-Flag competitions that simulate authentic cyberattack scenarios.

This improved performance in CTF environments directly translates to enhanced real-world vulnerability detection and threat analysis.

OpenAI acknowledges the dual-use nature of powerful AI tools, recognizing that such systems can support both defensive security research and malicious activities.

Consequently, the company is implementing a cautious deployment strategy with additional safeguards.

Kmet and Johnson — along with kicker Cairo Santos — are the only players remaining from the Bears’ last playoff team in 2020.
“This is what you dream about — the opportunity to play prime-time football, a rivalry game, playoff implications, seeding implications.
It’s also an indication of how new these dynamics are and how, collectively, the Bears still need to gain experience within big games.","This might sound wild to the long-timers at Halas Hall, who know all too well the struggles of a Chicago Bears franchise that’s almost 15 years removed from its last postseason victory and more than three decades past the team’s last stretch of three consecutive playoff seasons. But Bears newcomer C.J. Gardner-Johnson has never known anything other than this current existence. Important late-season games. A big stage. So much at stake. In line to be playoff-bound.

“It’s cool to know you’ve played meaningful football with a good group of guys every year,” Gardner-Johnson said Wednesday, his attention locked in on Saturday night’s spotlight game against the Green Bay Packers. “When you get to this stage, the focus level dials up a little more. You start to realize and feel that dynamic of win or go home.”

Gardner-Johnson is nearing the end of his seventh NFL season. Each of the previous six has included a trip to the postseason. Three appearances with the New Orleans Saints, one with the Detroit Lions, two with the Philadelphia Eagles.

Gardner-Johnson has been to the Super Bowl twice. He lost the first to the Kansas City Chiefs, a scar that still hasn’t fully healed. But he finally won the big one with the Eagles last winter, a 40-22 triumph over Kansas City in New Orleans.

So, yes, he is qualified to speak on the dynamics these Bears have stormed into.

“This,” Gardner-Johnson said, “is where teams separate themselves from good to great. And the way you’re locked in, you put all the focus on what’s going to help you continue to win. And you take care of your teammates.”

Center stage

The Bears find themselves in an interesting and unfamiliar place in mid-December, currently the No. 2 seed in the conference with a half-step on Green Bay in the chase for the NFC North championship. That’s why the meaning of Saturday night’s game has become so heightened.

For many inside the locker room, this is new territory. Defensive tackle Andrew Billings, for example, is in his eighth season and, through various roller-coaster rides with the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders and Bears, he has never known the existence of playing for a team with 10 victories. He and Bears coach Ben Johnson talked about just that earlier this week.

“If you’re someone who hasn’t experienced it a whole lot, you’re just grateful,” Johnson said. “You’re grateful for this.”

Receiver DJ Moore, Year 8, has also never been on a team that finished above .500 before this season. “People say the lights get brighter around this time,” Moore said. “I can’t wait to see that and be a part of it.”

Tight end Cole Kmet and cornerback Jaylon Johnson? They were the headliners of the Bears’ 2020 draft class. Which means that they are playing for their fourth head coach in their sixth season together.

Kmet and Johnson — along with kicker Cairo Santos — are the only players remaining from the Bears’ last playoff team in 2020. But even that felt little like this. That squad started the season 5-1, skidded to an 8-8 finish, backed into the 7 seed in the NFC and got blown out in the playoffs.

That was also during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the biggest crowd the Bears played for was 5,240 during an October road win at the Carolina Panthers. The attendance for the wild-card round in New Orleans was capped at 3,000.

This is not that. The buzz leading up to Saturday night is exploding.

“I’m excited about this, man,” Kmet said. “I’m really excited. This is what you put all the work in for, for these types of games. Obviously, we want to go in here and win the game. But there will definitely be a moment where you take it in. I’m sure Soldier Field is going to be rowdy. Saturday night. A lot of playoff implications. This is why you do it.”

‘No pressure’

At the start of this week, Ben Johnson dismissed the idea of galvanizing his players with a direct pep talk on the significance of Saturday night.

Bears-Packers. Soldier Field. First place on the line.

“There doesn’t need to be much of a message here this week,” Johnson said. “They know. They know what’s at stake.”

On Thursday, the Bears coach zoomed out a little, acknowledging the need for a carpe diem mentality. Johnson coached in playoff games with the Lions the last two seasons, and Detroit was alive for a postseason berth into the final hours of the 2022 season. But before that, Johnson, too, had been a part of an inordinate amount of losing across his previous 10 seasons with the Lions and Miami Dolphins.

Johnson is fully aware of what the Bears have set themselves up to be a part of. “You want to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said. “You just don’t know when it’s going to happen again. That’s the nature of the NFL.”

Jaylon Johnson dismissed the suggestion that these Bears will have to respond favorably to pressure over the final three weeks of the regular season and beyond.

“Respectfully,” he said, “we ain’t got no pressure. Everybody else was telling us we were not supposed to be here. So for us it’s just sticking true to what we know we can do and who we are.”

The Bears have a handful of veteran players who understand what is ahead, both with this critical closing stretch of regular-season games and then, hopefully, with playoff action.

Captain Joe Thuney, for example, has won four Super Bowls. Kevin Byard is pushing to play in the postseason for the sixth time. Grady Jarrett reached the Super Bowl as a rookie with the Atlanta Falcons — and lost in overtime to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.

Jarrett isn’t hiding his eagerness for Saturday night,

“This is what you play football for,” he said. “This is what you dream about — the opportunity to play prime-time football, a rivalry game, playoff implications, seeding implications. … You can’t ask for a better moment.”

Juice squeeze

Still, Jarrett’s push to the team is to keep things simple. “It’s just believing we are built for this moment,” he said. “It’s getting back to the basics, especially late in the season, knowing we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”

In front of his locker after Thursday’s practice, Kmet was asked to describe the electricity of being in this position with nothing but big games left on the docket.

“The juice of this is not maybe as heightened as you think it would be,” he said. “I think everyone in here has a really good demeanor. We’ve taken this approach of going game to game.

“I think going into the last game that we played against (Green Bay), I thought there was more juice going into the week. Like, almost too much — to where I felt like maybe there was a little pressing going on early in the game. Then you get in there at halftime, and you realize this is football. That’s all it is.”

That’s valuable perspective. It’s also an indication of how new these dynamics are and how, collectively, the Bears still need to gain experience within big games.

Gardner-Johnson has been there and done that.

“I thrive in big games,” he said. “You find that balance of being able to be assertive in making an impact without going outside the team.”

When Gardner-Johnson arrived at Halas Hall in October, he immediately sensed positive vibes in the locker room. Those have only heightened over the past eight weeks. So, too, has the sense of purpose.

“To get to that biggest stage, you have to be locked in,” Gardner-Johnson said. “The teams that get there understand that all criticism around this time of year is great criticism. … You’re also aware of the margin for error. It’s small. And it’ll jump up and bite you if you’re not careful.”

To that end, as weird as it sounds, the Bears have leaned into their flaws as a strength. Heading into a meaningful weekend, they’re also now feeding off the energized anticipation that has been created. “This,” Gardner-Johnson said, “is going to be fun. That’s how it’s supposed to be.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/09193735/GettyImages-2245871211-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-19 13:01:58.821563

The FTC says Instacart misled shoppers about “free delivery,” satisfaction guarantees, and automatic enrollment into its Instacart+ subscription program.

A proposed court order would bar the company from deceptive pricing and subscription tactics and require clearer disclosures and express consumer consent.

The Federal Trade Commission has announced that grocery delivery provider Instacart has agreed to pay $60 million in refunds to consumers as part of a settlement resolving allegations that the company engaged in widespread deceptive practices.

According to the FTC, those practices harmed shoppers and increased the overall cost of grocery delivery for Americans.

Under the proposed settlement, Instacart must also stop the misleading conduct identified by the agency. Consumers who were charged for Instacart+ memberships without their express, informed consent will be eligible for refunds.

“Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services, and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered, and failing to disclose to consumers who signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. He added that the agency is closely monitoring online delivery services to ensure companies compete transparently on price and delivery terms.

As of now, the FTC has not yet provided detailed specifics about how affected consumers will receive their refunds in the Instacart settlement. The agency typically releases that information — including the refund distribution process and whether consumers need to file a claim — only after the court approves the final order and the refund program is established.

Not so free

The FTC alleges that Instacart falsely advertised “free delivery” on first orders, even though consumers were still required to pay mandatory service fees. Those fees, which can add up to 15% to the cost of an order, were not clearly disclosed to shoppers, according to the agency.

Regulators also took issue with Instacart’s claims of a “100% satisfaction guarantee.” The FTC says the language suggested consumers would receive full refunds if they were dissatisfied, but in practice, customers who experienced late deliveries or poor service were often offered only small credits for future orders rather than refunds. In addition, the FTC alleges that Instacart obscured refund options within its self-service menu, leading many consumers to believe credits were their only option.

Another major focus of the complaint was Instacart’s handling of its Instacart+ subscription program. The FTC alleges that the company failed to clearly disclose that consumers who signed up for a free trial would be automatically charged at the end of the trial period. The agency also says Instacart did not adequately explain its restrictive refund policies, resulting in hundreds of thousands of consumers being charged membership fees without receiving benefits or refunds.

As part of the proposed settlement order, Instacart would be prohibited from misrepresenting delivery costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company would also be required to clearly and conspicuously disclose subscription terms and obtain express informed consent before enrolling consumers in programs that involve automatic charges unless customers actively opt out.

The FTC approved the stipulated final order by a 2–0 vote and filed it in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. If approved and signed by a federal judge, the order will carry the force of law.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/Instacart_GPT_CA-2025_o9ZD8jf.png,N,,2025-12-19 16:05:20.594042

The company also supplies sample-prep automation, QC instruments, and informatics solutions that help labs standardize long-read workflows, including those built around PacBio SMRT systems. With a broad footprint in clinical and translational labs, Thermo Fisher is well-positioned to support the move toward integrated DNA–RNA–protein analysis, in which SMRT sequencing provides high-fidelity, long-read genomes. At the same time, Thermo’s tools handle complementary assays and routine diagnostics.

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (US) contributes to the SMRT sequencing market primarily as an upstream and QC partner, offering high-precision LC, GC, electrophoresis, and Bioanalyzer/Fragment Analyzer platforms widely used for SMRT library quality control and sizing. Its target-enrichment kits, automation solutions, and analytical instruments help researchers optimize sample quality and focus on difficult genomic regions before running long-read SMRT experiments. By focusing on robust front-end prep, method development, and data validation, Agilent enables smoother adoption of SMRT workflows in research and clinical labs that require reliable, audit-ready results.

Apps are not simple plugins; they bring context and action into conversations, enabling tasks like creating playlists, ordering groceries or browsing real-estate listings without switching platforms.

This launch comes after a broader rollout of the ChatGPT Apps SDK earlier in 2025, which invited developers to build and test “chat-native” applications that respond to natural language and engage users within the conversational flow, extending ChatGPT’s role from answering queries to facilitating workflows, as reported by PYMNTS.

Developer Details

At the heart of the app store is the OpenAI Apps SDK, a developer toolkit that builds on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and allows external service providers to embed structured logic and interfaces into ChatGPT itself. Developers can now design applications that react contextually to user prompts, display interactive elements, and operate within a unified AI experience instead of siloed environments.

Verified developers can submit apps for review through the OpenAI Developer Platform. Submitted applications undergo a quality and safety review process; those that meet the guidelines can be published in the App Directory and become discoverable to the global ChatGPT user base.

OpenAI has also published detailed app submission guidelines, example apps and an open-sourced UI library to assist developers in building experiences that are intuitive within chat.

Apps can be triggered during conversations when users call them by name or select them through the tools interface. OpenAI is experimenting with ways to surface contextually relevant apps based on conversational signals like intent, usage patterns and user preferences.

While developers can currently link out from apps to complete transactions on external sites or native mobile applications, OpenAI is exploring new monetization methods over time, including the sale of digital goods and in-app commerce features, though specifics remain under development.

User Experience and Strategic Implications

For users, the ChatGPT app store means access to specialized tools and services without downloading standalone software. Instead of switching between native mobile apps or browser tabs, users can perform tasks like listening to curated playlists, ordering food or planning travel, all within the same chat interface.

This “AI-centric” user experience reduces friction and reimagines digital task flow around conversational intent. According to PYMNTS Intelligence data, nearly one-third of surveyed consumers say they would allow an AI agent to help with everyday planning and organization.

Early apps in the directory include integrations from Spotify, DoorDash, Zillow and Apple Music.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OpenAI-artificial-intelligence-ChatGPT.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 11:02:18.726361

As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder.","Zara is now using AI to digitally alter model images, showcasing new outfits without costly reshoots. This move, mirrored by H&M and Zalando, aims for faster visual production. While brands assure AI complements human roles and respects model consent and pay, concerns linger about potential job displacement for creatives.

Zara has quietly joined the growing list of fashion brands experimenting with artificial intelligence, and it’s already stirring conversation. The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again. The goal is pretty straightforward: faster visuals, fewer shoots, and quicker rollouts. But it also signals a bigger change in how fashion imagery is being made. Zara isn’t alone in this. Earlier this year, H&M revealed it had created AI-generated versions of models for its marketing work, and Zalando has been using similar tools to speed up campaign production. Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace. Zara’s parent company, Inditex, has been quick to clarify that AI isn’t here to replace humans. “We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” a company spokesperson said. They added that models are kept in the loop, their consent is taken before any AI edits are made, and payments follow industry standards. The details first came out through a report by London-based outlet CityAM. According to the report, a model said Zara asked for approval before using AI to digitally show them wearing different outfits. The model also shared that they were paid the same amount they would have earned if they had travelled for another shoot, which suggests brands are trying to tread carefully, at least for now. H&M and Zalando have made similar statements, saying AI is meant to support creative teams, not replace them. Photographers, stylists, makeup artists, and production crews are still part of the process, even if technology helps brands work faster and cut costs behind the scenes. What makes Zara’s move especially interesting is that Inditex chair Marta Ortega is known to be a big supporter of fashion photography. The daughter of Zara founder Amancio Ortega has often spoken about her love for the art form. Since 2021, her MOP Foundation gallery in A Coruña, the Spanish city where Zara began, has hosted exhibitions celebrating legendary photographers. Right now, the gallery is showing Annie Leibovitz’s work, and previous exhibitions have highlighted names like Steven Meisel, a long-time Zara collaborator, and Helmut Newton. At the same time, Ortega has been pushing Zara towards a more premium feel, shutting down smaller stores and focusing on larger, more polished flagship spaces. Still, not everyone is convinced this AI shift is harmless. Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired. Her concern is that this won’t just affect big names in the industry, but also young creatives trying to get their first break. As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder. And for now, the industry is still figuring out where exactly the line should be drawn.

The French beauty giant’s final 25.8% stake in the professional hair care brand has been divested to KKR’s managed capital accounts and investment affiliates.

Under the terms of the transaction, Coty will receive an upfront cash consideration of US$750m.

This also includes 45% of any proceeds from a further sale or an initial public offering (IPO) of the business, after KKR’s preferred return has been met.

Coty stated it sees “strong potential” for additional cash proceeds, based on Wella’s “strong recent and expected performance”, as well as current market valuations.

The stake divestment rounds off Coty’s optimisation programme, initiated in 2020 to simplify its portfolio and operations, while also realising the full value of its Wella business.

“This transaction marks a pivotal milestone for Coty – both in our transformation and in our long running deleveraging commitment,” said Laurent Mercier, Coty’s CFO.

“Our strategic partnership with KKR has proven highly value accretive.

“We have benefited from Wella’s strong growth by progressively monetising our stake, allowing us to strengthen Coty’s financial foundations year after year.”

Coty intends to use the majority of the Wella upfront cash proceeds related to this transaction to pay down its short-term and long-term debt.

American multinational investment bank Citi is serving as financial advisor to Coty.

Mercier added: “Completing this transaction exactly in line with our original target to fully divest Wella by the end of CY25 underscores our focus on delivering on our financial commitments and crystallising value from non-core assets, all while sharpening our strategic focus.”

OpenAI entered ""code red"" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3.
Since OpenAI entered ""code red,"" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.
The state of ""code red"" has also been a precedent for other tech companies.
In 2022, Google declared an internal ""code red"" after ChatGPT's debut.","""Code red"" isn't a one-off at OpenAI.

CEO Sam Altman said on an episode of the ""Big Technology Podcast"" published Thursday that the company has entered emergency mode multiple times in response to competitive threats — and expects to continue doing so as rivals close in.

""It's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,"" Altman said.

""My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space,"" he added.

Altman said that OpenAI had gone ""code red"" earlier this year when China's DeepSeek emerged. DeepSeek shocked the tech industry in January when it said its AI model matches top competitors like ChatGPT's o1 at a fraction of the cost.

OpenAI entered ""code red"" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3. The model drew widespread praise after its release in November, with Google touting it as its most advanced model to date. Altman reportedly told staff in an internal Slack memo that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.

Altman said in the podcast episode that Google's Gemini 3 did not have ""the impact we were worried it might.""

""But it did — in the same way that Deepseek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,"" he added.

Since OpenAI entered ""code red,"" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.

Last week, it rolled out a more advanced AI model aimed at improving ChatGPT's performance across professional work, coding, and scientific tasks. OpenAI also unveiled a new image-generation model earlier this week.

Altman said the company will not be in code red ""that much longer.""

""Historically, these have been kind of like six- or eight-week things for us,"" he added.

The state of ""code red"" has also been a precedent for other tech companies. In 2022, Google declared an internal ""code red"" after ChatGPT's debut.

The view that emerging markets are high-risk destinations for investment has long shaped the global marketplace, keeping a disproportionate share of capital in wealthier countries.

This mismatch is increasingly untenable. Where public and private investment is scarce, jobs will not flourish — with profound implications for prosperity and security, as hundreds of millions of young workers enter the labour force over the next decade across developing countries.

Greater clarity around emerging market risks is needed not simply to change well-worn beliefs but to have a tangible impact on where capital is deployed.

There are some positive signs. Recently announced changes to the S&P Global Ratings methodology for rating multilateral lending institutions and other supranational institutions — those owned or established by the governments of two or more countries — are one of the latest signs of that trend.

The rating agency recently reviewed how it evaluates international development institutions — like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank — that lend to governments. After five months of consultations with stakeholders, it updated its methodology, resulting in improved credit ratings for these institutions. The changes specifically adjusted how S&P weighs the risks when these multilateral lenders provide loans to sovereign governments.

According to the agency, the revised methodology could unlock between $600bn and $800bn in sovereign lending by multilateral development banks to emerging markets and developing economies. This would support better infrastructure, more food security, reliable electricity and job creation at a time when it is needed most.

This decision is underpinned by data from GEMs: the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database. Developed by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation, it is the largest credit risk database of its kind.

By pooling credit risk data from multilateral development banks, GEMs offers unprecedented transparency on emerging market credit risks. In doing so, it is separating fact from perception and demonstrating that emerging markets are not nearly as risky as previously thought, especially when investing alongside MDBs.

The most recent GEMs statistics, published in October 2025, highlight that direct lending by MDBs to 167 sovereign emerging market and developing economies have shown strong loan performance over the past four decades.

Between 1984 and 2024, the annual default rate averaged less than 1 per cent, significantly lower than that observed by international credit rating agencies for sovereign lending from non-MDB lenders. And on the flipside, recovery rates on loans to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed entities averaged more than 95 per cent. The data from GEMs is also compelling when looking at MDB lending for private and public sector entities in emerging markets.

These statistics speak for themselves. The data demonstrates that evidence-based investing in emerging markets and developing economies, particularly alongside MDBs, could be win-win for everyone. And the change to S&P’s rating methodology shows the support for, and confidence in, the multilateral institutions’ ability to scale public and private finance investments in emerging markets.

Most importantly, it sets the stage for a broader shift in investment strategies that allows other key rating agencies and investors to take evidence-based reviews of their risk methodologies in favour of increased lending and potential new capital where it is needed most.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/19997689-1cb0-4d1b-90b1-61276bca4f80.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 08:01:51.484050

Booking Holdings, Expedia and Airbnb are accused of allowing money to be made from bookings on seized Palestinian land.
Result of unbiased, ongoing review - ASB ASB said it had spent ""significant time"" completing a review of Motorola Solutions.
""We are now specifying Motorola Solutions as an excluded investment from the funds.","ASB has dropped Motorola Solutions from its investment funds, including KiwiSaver, after pressure from pro-Palestine groups.

Motorola provides telecommunications, surveillance and military technology to the Israeli military and illegal Israeli settlements.

But ethical investment platform Mindful Money says the big banks are still investing in companies that are exposed to human rights violations in Palestine.

Founder Barry Coates said it was welcome that ASB had divested from Motorola.

""At last ASB has agreed to sell their investments in Motorola Solutions, over two years after the information was disclosed on Mindful Money's website and after campaigning by Justice for Palestine, Amnesty International Aotearoa and others.

""This is welcome news.

""However, each of the big four bank-branded KiwiSaver funds still invest in companies that contribute to violations of human rights in Palestine, despite Kiwis saying they want to avoid those investments. The banks are not listening to the thousands of Kiwis who have invested in their funds.""

He said, before the divestment, ASB had 0.87 percent of its KiwiSaver growth fund in companies Mindful Money identified as problematic in the conflict with Israel including IBM, Palantir, Motorola, Booking Holdings, Airbnb and Cemex.

ANZ had 0.54 percent of its growth fund in Booking Holdings, Airbnb, Motorola, Volvo and IBM.

BNZ had 0.79 percent in Palantir, IBM, Booking Holdings, Glencore, Airbnb, Rheinmetall AG, Holcim, Volvo, Expedia, Heildelberge Materials, Cemex and Maersk.

Westpac had 0.57 percent in Booking Holdings, Caterpillar, Palantir Technologies, IBM, Holcim, and Heidelberg Materials.

Booking Holdings, Expedia and Airbnb are accused of allowing money to be made from bookings on seized Palestinian land.

""The ongoing crises in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem are affecting the lives of millions of Palestinian people. Our KiwiSaver funds should not be invested in companies that are supporting violations of their rights,"" Coates said.

Result of unbiased, ongoing review - ASB

ASB said it had spent ""significant time"" completing a review of Motorola Solutions.

""Previously, we have been able to meet with Motorola and they had engaged openly with us to answer any questions we've had,"" it said in a statement.

""In October this year, as part of our latest review, we reached out to Motorola again to discuss their inclusion on the updated UN OHCHR database, and request that they meet with us to provide an update.

""Motorola has failed to respond to this request, despite multiple follow ups. This lack of engagement and our inability to receive an update is a concern to us and one of the factors underpinning our decision to divest.

""We are now specifying Motorola Solutions as an excluded investment from the funds. This decision is the result of our unbiased and ongoing review as part of our own due diligence, and not a result of external pressure from any group or organisation, which is not new with regards to this issue.

""We condemn all violence, and as we have said previously, our position on this particular holding doesn't represent support, or otherwise, for any group or people, of any identity.""

Westpac, ANZ and BNZ have been approached for comment.

'Huge win'

""ASB's divestment from Motorola is a huge win for the fight in Aotearoa New Zealand for Palestinians to have equal human rights in their homeland,"" Justice for Palestine spokesperson Kate Stone said.

""Israel is only able to maintain its apartheid regime of systemic discrimination against Palestinians and expand its illegal settlements because of the material support of the international community. This includes investments of financial institutions like ASB and other New Zealand banks and KiwiSaver fund managers.

""Over 8500 people signed the petition calling on ASB to divest, and hundreds of customers moved their KiwiSavers, mortgages and banking services away from ASB because they support Palestinians having the same rights to freedom, justice and equality as the rest of humanity,"" Stone said.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--RhMzSKeW--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1668055945/4LIJ0NT_ASB_2_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-12-19 04:03:09.205735

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.38%.

Shares of the upscale clothing company witnessed a gain of 10.53% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Consumer Discretionary sector with its gain of 2.39%, and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.

Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Ralph Lauren in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.75, showcasing a 19.29% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $2.3 billion, indicating a 7.27% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $15.41 per share and revenue of $7.75 billion, which would represent changes of +24.98% and +9.54%, respectively, from the prior year.

Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Ralph Lauren. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.

Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

Investors should also note Ralph Lauren's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.74. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 17.93.

Also, we should mention that RL has a PEG ratio of 1.77.

Ideally, by the time the press gets their hands on a new product or service, all the kinks have already been worked out.

Not so for “Claudius,” an AI-operated vending machine that Anthropic lent to The Wall Street Journal for testing in November.

The end results were hilariously disastrous. Claudius was supposed to order inventory, set prices and respond to customer requests. Instead it bought a Playstation 5 and a live betta fish, gave away items in what it referred to as an “Ultra-Capitalist Free-For-All” and spent more than twice its allotted budget.

Anthropic, for its part, considers the experiment a success, or so its reps told the Journal. These kinds of stress tests, after all, give them insight into what needs fixing.

But the question remains: Why test it with journalists, of all people?

Sure, highlighting the WSJ’s red team efforts would’ve been fun a few years ago, back when the internet was still giggling over DALL-E memes. But now that so many companies are actively trying to capitalize on this technology – and encountering similar, albeit less absurd performance issues – all publicity might not be good publicity anymore.

Put more simply, if AI agents can’t reliably buy snacks yet, then what hope do marketers have in making them work right now?

Ads vs. AIs

Personalized advertising allows tons of content to be free and accessible while enriching companies up and down the supply chain. The downside is that everybody hates it.

For example, Meta is correct to keep its focus relentlessly on improvements to its digital advertising flywheel, writes Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. His hot take is in response to a New York Times story about tensions between Meta’s AI lab team and Facebook-era leaders.

The flip side of the coin is OpenAI, which, as The Information reports, has an awkward “ChatGPT problem.” Its cutting-edge AI research team is frustrated, too, because new stakeholders within OpenAI are pushing for more monetization. The latest updates to OpenAI’s core models prioritize capability gains over monetization metrics like user retention and subscriptions.

Seufert writes that this imbalance favors Meta and Google. Their large ad businesses grow as the companies add users and improve the proficiency of their ad systems. OpenAI’s API revenues go up when its models improve – but not nearly enough to meet its revenue projections.

That shortfall must be made up by advertising revenue at some point.

All Fun And Games

Will in-game advertising ever really happen? The idea remains tantalizing yet illusive.

No online platform has a better shot at it, though, than Roblox, as Digiday reports.

The rationale for in-game ads is pretty straightforward. Engagement is through the roof. Roblox has 151 million daily active users who spend close to three hours per day on average in the app.

And Roblox wouldn’t have to saturate players with ads to see a healthy return. Snapchat’s average revenue per user, for instance, is in the $12 to $15 per year range. Less than half of that would mean an instant multibillion-dollar business line for Roblox.

On the other hand, Roblox’s user base is young – like tweens and younger. This complicates the picture, because there are extra rules governing how data can be used for targeting, which shrinks the pool of possible advertisers.

So while the potential is massive, Roblox’s path to ad billions still feels more like a pipe dream than a pay day.

Lululemon's approach didn't sit well with its founder, Dennis “Chip” Wilson, who saw it as a sign of insufficient planning.","Lululemon needs a new CEO. One investor's preferred candidate might not be a a stretch.

Less than a week has passed since Lululemon announced it was seeking a CEO, and one of its biggest stakeholders is already floating a candidate who—based on the market's reaction—seems to appeal to fellow investors: Jane Nielsen, who contributed to turnarounds at Ralph Lauren (RL) and Coach, now part of Tapestry (TPR).

Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has put forward Nielsen, the notion which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Elliott has acquired a more than $1 billion stake in the retailer, according to a person familiar with the matter, giving it sway in a company with a market value of about $25 billion.

Lululemon Athletica (LULU) didn't respond to a request for comment in time for publication. But investors appear to be considering the involvement of Elliott—and its pick of Nielsen, previously CFO at Ralph Lauren and now a board member at Mondelēz International (MDLZ)—warmly: Company shares were recently up more than 4%. (They remain down more than 40% this year, part of why a new chief is needed in the first place.)

“Lululemon is one of the most powerful brands in retail, defined by exceptional products, deeply engaged communities and significant global potential,” Nielsen told The Journal. “I would welcome the chance to discuss this opportunity with the Lululemon board.""

The Canada-based retailer last week said CEO Calvin McDonald will leave his post at the end of January, and that it was seeking a successor with growth and restructuring experience. The move stood out in a time when a number of other well-known consumer-facing companies, such as Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT) and Nike (NIKE) have named successors without a public search.

Lululemon's approach didn't sit well with its founder, Dennis “Chip” Wilson, who saw it as a sign of insufficient planning. Wilson has a more than 8% stake in Lululemon. He also has a history of publicizing when he disagrees with the retailer, including voicing concern about Lululemon moving far beyond its yoga-focused roots. He didn't respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication.

However, the increased demand during this festive time often leads to longer wait times at coffee shops and drive-thrus. Despite the delays, many customers feel that the indulgence is worth their time.

On a less festive note, the coffee industry has faced significant challenges throughout the year, particularly for major players like Starbucks and Peet’s. In September, Starbucks announced plans to close hundreds of stores as part of a restructuring effort expected to cost the company $1 billion. The coffee giant revealed it would reduce its North American store count by about 1%, decreasing from 18,734 to 18,300 locations by the end of fiscal year 2025. The decision came after a thorough review of its North American portfolio, targeting underperforming stores or those that cannot meet new design standards.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol emphasized the necessity of this decision, stating that some locations did not meet the physical standards expected by customers and employees, or lacked a clear path to financial viability. In addition to store closures, the company will invest in remodeling a thousand locations at a cost of $150,000 each by 2026.

Peet’s Coffee, which operates over 250 locations in the U.S., has also experienced closures, including recent shut-downs in several California cities. However, optimism surrounds Peet’s as its parent company, JDE Peet’s, is set to be acquired by Keurig Dr Pepper in an $18 billion deal expected to finalize in the first half of 2026.

In contrast, Compass Coffee is facing dire circumstances, having recently closed its Washington, D.C. roastery amid financial distress. The coffee company has indicated potential plans to file for bankruptcy protection by the end of the year. Following a court ruling, Compass Coffee has been mandated to pay approximately $744,000 in back rent to its landlord and has not been able to cover rent since January 2025. If the company cannot negotiate a rent reduction, it may have to vacate its premises altogether.

Despite these challenges, Compass Coffee continues to operate 25 locations across Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, although the current financial situation casts uncertainty over its future.

He served in the U.S. Army from 1964 to 1967, stationed overseas and reaching the rank of E-6. In Kankakee, Thomas was a longtime member and supporter of St. Patrick Church, and owner-operator of AC Forms Inc. for 35 years.

Thomas is survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Patricia (Newman) Johnson. They were married in May 1969 and built a life filled with love and laughs.

His legacy lives on through his children and their partners: Kimberly Zaccone and her partner Tom Castro, Danette Johnson and her husband Mark Switzer, Darren Johnson, Jeffery and his wife Erica (Simmons) Johnson, Samantha and her husband Kyle Johnson. The sparkle in his eyes was always brightest when he was with his grandchildren: Alyssa, Nick, Brooke, and Max Zaccone; Kylie, Jax, and Lilliann Johnson; and his great-grandchildren, Paxton and Alexander Zaccone.

Thomas devoted his life to providing for his family, offering steady support, strength, love, and humor. While his family grieves his loss, they take comfort in knowing he is at peace and that his spirit will live on in the countless memories they shared. He will be deeply missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him.

A service will be held at St. Patrick Church, 428 S. Indiana Ave., Kankakee, at 11 a.m. on Saturday, December 20th. A visitation will follow at Jensen Funeral Home, 3639 E.

As kids go, Monica Santamaria was always on the move.

“She absolutely loved swimming, volleyball, decorating and painting,” said her father, Roberto. “Her passion was contagious. She wore us out in a good way. We never saw any hints of physical problems. She was perfectly healthy.”

That all changed when Monica turned 6.

Her parents noticed her body curved to the left when she walked, and a similar curve began forming in her back. Doctors in Monica’s hometown of Managua, Nicaragua did a variety of tests and eventually diagnosed her with scoliosis, a severe and painful curvature of the spine that sometimes afflicts children, generally girls, during growth spurts.

“We had never heard of scoliosis and so the news was devastating,” Roberto remembers. “The more we learned, the more frightened we became.”

Monica experienced many symptoms: back pain, pain in her lower limbs, cramps, fatigue, headaches, and trouble sleeping. Suddenly the girl with so much energy and love for sports couldn’t participate in gym class or play games that might hurt her back.

“I felt sad because I had so much fun doing those things but then I couldn’t,” Monica said. “Sometimes I had to play by myself because the teachers didn’t want my classmates to hurt me accidentally.”

From desperation to hope

Scoliosis can often be treated through spine surgery, but such care is not available in Nicaragua. The Santamarias learned through their spine specialist about the medical missions of SpineHope, a U.S. based nonprofit that brings together surgeons, donated medical and surgical equipment, and teams of volunteers to take scoliosis treatment to various countries, including Nicaragua.

“It’s the most altruistic thing I’ve ever seen,” said Toby Hernandez, a sales rep in the Medtronic Cranial and Spinal Technologies Operating Unit who volunteers with SpineHope. “These children, these families, have no other options. They’re desperate. When they learn their child is going to get help, it’s a very emotional moment. Everybody in the room is crying, including us.”

The volunteer teams typically take two to four mission trips every year. Three missions are planned for 2025. Each trip involves prepping, packing, shipping and setting up an entire, functioning operating room in another country — roughly 30 bins of precision medical equipment and spine implants.

“It’s hard work, but it’s life-changing work and it’s all for these families and these children,” said Whitney Scurlock-Wood, a Medtronic spinal sales representative who has volunteered with SpineHope for the last four years. “Seeing the difference we make in people’s lives is just amazing. I take away something from every mission trip I go on.”

The team often performs several procedures on each mission. Occasionally, SpineHope’s case assessment concludes the patient should be brought to the U.S. for surgery, and that’s what happened with Monica.

“It didn’t hurt anymore”

For a month before surgery, Monica wore a halo-gravity traction device, which is a way of gently stretching the spine before surgery. Doctors attached a metal ring to Monica’s head and slowly added weights to a pulley system to apply traction to her spine. Eventually the system weighed 35 pounds, almost half of Monica’s body weight. But the process reduced her spine curvature by almost 50 percent, from 127 degrees to 73 degrees, and prepared her for the surgery.

Then, volunteer surgeons used donated Medtronic spine products in the procedure to straighten her curved spine.

Several Medtronic volunteers participated in the eight-hour operation.

Monica’s recovery started almost immediately. “The medical assistants helped her stand up the day after surgery and she took her first steps,” Roberto said. “It was incredible. Amazing.”

Seven days later, Monica left the hospital, no longer in pain and walking on her own. “It didn’t hurt anymore and I could do the things I liked to do again,” she said.

Today, Monica is back to swimming, playing volleyball, skating, and painting — activities she always loved but had to limit due to her condition. Her mood changed drastically; her smile is back and she’s happily looking forward to a life full of new possibilities.

“I’m grateful to everyone on my care team for everything they’ve done for me,” Monica said. “They gave me my life back.”

Medtronic has partnered with SpineHope ever since its formation in 2008—helping change the lives of more than 200 young patients.

“Medtronic is so committed to doing the right thing for the right people, Hernandez said. “It’s amazing and inspiring to be a part of it.”

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-15 of this pricing supplement.

SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS

The Notes are not appropriate for all investors. The Notes may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

●You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons and Unpaid Coupon Amounts, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Reference Asset.

●You are willing and able to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity.

●You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below the Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date.

●You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure.

●You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value.

●You understand and accept the risk that you will not receive any Unpaid Coupon Amounts unless a Contingent Coupon becomes payable on a subsequent Observation Date.

●You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Reference Asset.

●You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.

●You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

●You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset.

●You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed.

●You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

●You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

●You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of the Reference Asset rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons and Unpaid Coupon Amounts, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Barrier Value.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity.

●You anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Barrier Value.

●You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of the Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons (and thus, Unpaid Coupon Amounts) and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

●You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL

The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption:

■For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below.

Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 5.375%.

Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the third Call Valuation Date.

** Any Unpaid Coupon Amount has been paid on a previous Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 10.75%.

Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date.

** Assumes NO Contingent Coupons have been previously paid. Accordingly, this amount includes the Contingent Coupon that is payable on this Contingent Coupon Payment Date plus the Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have accrued.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 18.8125%.

Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date.

Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on your Notes will be limited to the Contingent Coupons and any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that may be payable on the Notes. Each of these examples also demonstrate that, if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If a Contingent Coupon does not become payable with respect to an Observation Date (and instead becomes an Unpaid Coupon Amount), you will receive payment of such amount only if a Contingent Coupon becomes payable with respect to a future Observation Date. If a Contingent Coupon fails to become payable with respect to an Observation Date, and if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each subsequent Observation Date, you will never receive payment of the Unpaid Coupon Amount(s). If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any coupon payments during the term of the Notes.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

** per $1,000 principal amount Note, excluding the final Contingent Coupon that may be payable on the Maturity Date, and assumes we do not elect to exercise our physical settlement option. For an example demonstrating the amount of shares and cash that you would receive if (a) the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value and (b) we elect to exercise our physical settlement option, please see the final example below.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $210.00.

Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus (i) the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date and (ii) any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have not previously been paid).

Example 2: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $90.00.

Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus (i) the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date and (ii) any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have not previously been paid).

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Asset or its components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Reference Asset from the Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with our Physical Settlement Option — As described on the cover of this pricing supplement, you may under certain circumstances receive shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. If we exercise our physical settlement option, the market value of the shares that you receive may be less than the amount of the cash payment that you would have received had we not exercised such option because of fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset between the Final Valuation Date and the Maturity Date.

●Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of The Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes (whether paid as Contingent Coupons on the Contingent Coupon Payment Date following an Observation Date or as Unpaid Coupon Amounts on a subsequent Contingent Coupon Payment Date). You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date and you will only receive the related Unpaid Coupon Amount if a Contingent Coupon becomes payable on a future Observation Date. If a Contingent Coupon fails to become payable on an Observation Date (and instead becomes an Unpaid Coupon Amount), and no Contingent Coupon becomes payable on any future Observation Date, you will never receive payment of the Unpaid Coupon Amount(s). If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Asset. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Asset been lower. As volatility of the Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of the Reference Asset will be less than the Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months.

The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Asset determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Reference Asset has increased from the Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning a Reference Asset or Any Securities to which a Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure may have.

●Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Reference Asset

●Historical Performance of the Reference Asset Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Asset Over the Term of the Notes — The value of the Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of the Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of the Reference Asset.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs — Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or a Reference Asset or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Single Equity Risk — The value of the Reference Asset can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Reference Asset, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the Reference Asset. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the Reference Asset or of any other publicly available information regarding the Reference Asset.

●Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent may replace the Reference Asset with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the Reference Asset upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent or may make other changes to the terms of the Notes to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the Calculation Agent to replace the Reference Asset, to accelerate the Notes or to otherwise adjust the terms of the Notes could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the Notes than if the Calculation Agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Asset or its components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Asset and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Asset, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and this pricing supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

●The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

●Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Asset or the components of the Reference Asset, if any;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSET

We urge you to read the following section in the accompanying prospectus supplement: “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Reference Asset Issuer and Reference Asset Information.” Companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “’40 Act,” are required to periodically file certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the Reference Asset that you may receive at maturity. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential U.S. federal tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Reference Asset.

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, and except as described below, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption for cash upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

If you receive shares of the Reference Asset upon the maturity of your Notes, you should be deemed to have applied the purchase price of your Notes toward the purchase of the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. You should not recognize gain or loss with respect to the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. Instead, assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position described above, your basis in the shares (including any fractional share) should equal the price you paid to acquire your Notes, and that basis should be allocated proportionately among the shares. Your holding period for the Reference Asset should begin on the day after receipt. With respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of the Reference Asset, you should recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the cash received and the tax basis allocable to the fractional share.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

We have agreed to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent commits to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.

VALIDITY OF THE NOTES

In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special United States products counsel to Barclays Bank PLC, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement have been issued by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the indenture, the trustee has made, in accordance with instructions from Barclays Bank PLC, appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such Notes (the “master note”), and such Notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be valid and binding obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith) and possible judicial or regulatory actions or application giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws affecting creditors’ rights, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of the stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by English law, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP has relied, with Barclays Bank PLC’s permission, on the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP, dated as of May 15, 2025, filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form F-3ASR by Barclays Bank PLC on May 15, 2025, and this opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations as set forth in such opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the master note and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, dated May 15, 2025, which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement referred to above.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-12-19 04:03:04.553089

As those closely following this field will know, in April 2025 HMT published a draft statutory instrument (SI), on which we wrote an earlier briefing highlighting key issues, as well as an unapologetically technical and detailed formal submission to HMT on the drafting. This article summarises how HMT has responded (or not) to our concerns, as well as touching on an important widening of the scope of the legislation to cover the introduction of a regime covering market abuse and admission to trading. The key point on the former topic is that HMT has, as it promised throughout its engagement with the sector, taken onboard the most fundamental critiques of the mistakes in the draft SI, but some issues remain. In addition, the FCA chose the following day to publish three consultation papers relevant to cryptoassets (merry Christmas!), which will be the subject of separate briefings.

The view suggests that leading PC manufacturers such as Lenovo, Dell, HP Inc, Apple, and Acer, with healthy inventory levels, advantages in procurement scale due to superior market share, and the ability to pass costs onto customers, are well-positioned to mitigate the effects of DRAM price increases in the second half of 2026.

With procurement volume and economies of scale, the five major PC manufacturers—Lenovo, HP Inc, Dell, Apple, and Acer—are expected to gain a slight increase in market share. Additionally, given their leadership positions in the server, smartphone, and enterprise storage markets, these companies are anticipated to enhance their purchasing power and secure priority access to memory supplies.

Other manufacturers, accounting for approximately 25% of the market share or around 65 to 70 million PCs, may face higher premiums for memory procurement, making it difficult to implement competitive pricing strategies. This presents an opportunity for leading vendors to further expand their market share in the mid-to-low price segments.

The report forecasts that AI-powered PCs are expected to account for 54% of total shipments in 2026, up from 34% in 2025; among these, AI PCs with computational power below 40 TOPS will represent 32% of total shipments and 62% of AI PC demand.

Beyond AI, the Windows 11 upgrade is expected to remain a key catalyst for shipments by Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc in 2026. The current progress of the Windows 11 upgrade has lagged behind previous cycles. At present, approximately 35%-40% of Windows PCs still operate on older operating systems. This upgrade should help support shipments amid rising PC prices, particularly benefiting these three companies that hold leading positions in the commercial PC sector.

Over the past 12 months, Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc collectively accounted for 75% of global commercial PC shipments. Despite strong brand loyalty among commercial customers and lower elasticity of demand in this segment compared to the consumer market, PC manufacturers will continue to optimize configurations to sustain demand and maximize sales.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022050900000233719bee4b9bc.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 03:00:46.269166

“We are deeply alarmed by reports that Instacart is using AI to hike prices on unsuspecting customers based on their shopping habits. People shouldn’t be charged higher prices than their neighbors for the same milk or eggs because their grocery app is profiling them. This is personalized price gouging, plain and simple.

“While hardworking Americans struggle to afford groceries, corporations like Instacart are inventing new ways to rip them off. Surveillance pricing is a blatant abuse of power by big tech — automating greed and making consumers pay the price.

“Enough is enough. With Instacart processing hundreds of millions of orders yearly, these practices warrant urgent action. The FTC and state regulators must immediately investigate Instacart and hold it accountable for ripping off its customers. And we need to ban personalized price gouging to ensure that everyone pays a fair price.”

Background

Instacart’s pricing tactics are detailed in a new report from Groundwork Collaborative and Consumer Reports, “Same Cart, Different Price.” The report describes how Instacart uses AI-driven “price experiments” to maximize margins by charging different customers different prices for identical items at the same store. According to the report, Instacart deploys software from its subsidiary Eversight to identify the highest price an individual is willing to pay.

Ralph Lauren Corporation recently declared a regular quarterly dividend of US$0.9125 per share, payable on January 9, 2026 to shareholders of record as of December 26, 2025, underlining its ongoing cash returns to investors.

Ralph Lauren Investment Narrative Recap

To own Ralph Lauren, you need to believe in its ability to pair a resilient premium brand with disciplined execution, even as macro and pricing risks linger. The latest dividend declaration reinforces the appeal for income-focused holders, but does not materially change the near term balance between strong earnings momentum as a key catalyst and demand sensitivity to higher prices as a central risk.

Among recent developments, the stronger than expected Q2 2026 results stand out in the context of this dividend news, with revenue up 17% and adjusted EPS rising 49% year over year. Management’s upgraded full year outlook for 5% to 7% constant currency revenue growth and operating margin expansion frames the dividend as one part of a broader capital return story supported by current operating performance.

Yet despite this strength, investors should also be aware of how rising tariffs and consumer price sensitivity could...

Johnson Matthey has opened its first hydrogen internal combustion engine (H₂ICE) facility in what appears to be a healthy bet ahead of the European Union’s delay of zero-tailpipe vehicle sales previously slated for 2035.

A Dec. 16 statement published by Europe’s trade body, the European Commission, said lawmakers have agreed to allow “plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035.”

The move is the culmination of growing warnings by both automotive industry leaders and politicians, such as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, that an ICE ban could decimate Europe’s legacy brands.

So, Johnson Matthey’s Dec. 11 announcement that it has opened a new center of H₂ICE excellence in Gothenburg, Sweden, to strengthen its world-class heavy-duty vehicle testing capabilities places the company ahead of the curve.

Interest in burning hydrogen in traditional engines has increased this year, with companies including South Korean automaker KGM and Mahle Powertrain seeing the technology as a fast way to expand hydrogen infrastructure ahead of the rollout of hydrogen fuel-cell powertrains.

Johnson Matthey said in its release that the tried-and-tested engine technology, presents “a viable path for decarbonizing medium and heavy-duty transport, such as trucks and buses.”

The center has been completed on time and on budget, representing a £2.5 million ($3.35 million) investment over three years.

The facility, already a test site for medium and heavy-duty diesel engines, supports H₂ICE engines up to 600 kW (800 hp).

It will now test the performance of catalysts within the wider engine after-treatment and control systems, providing key insights into the development of hydrogen mobility solutions, said the company.

“For more than two centuries, JM has helped tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges,” said Tauseef Salma, Johnson Matthey’s chief technology officer for clean air, in a statement. “We continue to do so today because it’s in our DNA,” she added.

For a profitable bank like UniCredit, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a practical way to gauge whether the share price makes sense relative to the earnings it is generating today. In general, higher growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or greater uncertainty usually warrant a lower multiple.

UniCredit currently trades on a PE of about 10.55x, which is slightly below both the Banks industry average of roughly 10.84x and the broader peer group at around 12.34x. On the surface, that suggests the market is applying a small discount to UniCredit compared to similar companies.

Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what PE UniCredit should trade on, based on its earnings growth outlook, profitability, risk profile, size and banking industry dynamics, rather than relying only on blunt peer comparisons. For UniCredit, this Fair Ratio is 11.57x, modestly above the current 10.55x. That gap indicates the shares still look undervalued on a PE basis, even after their strong run.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your UniCredit Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, an easy tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you turn your view of UniCredit’s story into specific assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins. You can then link those to a financial forecast and Fair Value, and compare that Fair Value to today’s share price to decide whether to buy or sell. Each Narrative updates automatically when new news or earnings arrive. One investor might build a bullish UniCredit Narrative that assumes digitalisation, wealth management growth and successful deals with Alpha Bank and Commerzbank justify a Fair Value near the top of current analyst targets around €77. A more cautious investor, worried about demographics, geopolitics and margin pressure, could reasonably land closer to the lower end near €57. Both perspectives are clearly captured, quantified and comparable in one place.

(NASDAQ:AIRT) is pleased to announce the successful closing of its acquisition of Regional Express Holdings Limited (Rex), Australia's leading regional airline. Air T now owns 100% of Rex and looks forward to beginning a new chapter for Rex and the regional communities it serves across Australia.

The transaction includes a comprehensive financing structure designed to support Rex's operations and future growth:

Air T is providing a $50 million AUD credit facility that is funded by one of our investor partners. We anticipate that Rex will use this facility to bring its fleet fully back into service, from approximately 31 flyers currently to 45 flyers within the next two years.

The Commonwealth of Australia will continue to be a secured creditor of Rex.

Rex will have access to an additional undrawn $60 million AUD loan from the Commonwealth of Australia to support the overhaul of its current fleet of Saab 340s and general operations.

This financing arrangement reflects the collaborative approach taken by Air T, the Commonwealth of Australia, and other stakeholders to assure Rex thrives for the long-term and continues to service regional Australians. A strong Rex is good for Australia.

""We are excited to welcome Rex to Air T and to continue the important work of strengthening regional aviation in Australia,"" said Nick Swenson, Chief Executive Officer of Air T, Inc. ""Rex serves communities that depend on reliable air service, and we are committed to ensuring the airline operates on a sustainable basis for the long term. This acquisition aligns with our strategy of investing in essential aviation businesses with strong fundamentals, great management teams and meaningful roles in their markets.""

Neville Howell, Chief Executive Officer of Regional Express commented, ""The acquisition by Air T marks not just the resolution of a challenging chapter, but the beginning of a revitalised one. It is the outcome of disciplined planning, principled decision-making and an unwavering commitment to the regional communities we exist for. With renewed strength and clarity, we move forward, not defined by the turbulence behind us, but by the possibilities ahead.

As we move forward, we will remain true to our core. We are an airline with a responsibility to connect Australians, and we will approach this next chapter with the same pragmatism, care and resolve that guided us through the challenges behind us. This partnership does not redefine Rex. It strengthens our capacity to honour the purpose that has always defined us; to serve the regions that built us, with our heart firmly in the country.""

Air T and Rex are grateful for the support and collaboration of the Administrators, the Commonwealth of Australia, Rex's creditors, and all stakeholders throughout this process.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) addressed a maximum-severity security vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-37164 (CVSS score of 10.0), in OneView Software. An attacker can exploit the flaw to achieve remote code execution.

HPE OneView is an integrated IT management and automation platform by Hewlett Packard Enterprise used to manage, monitor, and automate HPE data center infrastructure.

It provides a single, software-defined interface to control servers, storage, and networking, mainly in HPE environments (e.g., ProLiant servers and Synergy systems).

“A potential security vulnerability has been identified in Hewlett Packard Enterprise OneView Software. This vulnerability could be exploited, allowing a remote unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution.” reads the advisory published by the company.

The flaw impacts all versions through v10.20.

It is unclear if the threat actors have already exploited the vulnerability in attacks in the wild.

In June, HPE released security patches for eight vulnerabilities in its StoreOnce backup solution. These issues could allow remote code execution, authentication bypass, data leaks, and more.

“Potential security vulnerabilities have been identified in HPE StoreOnce Software.” reads the advisory. “These vulnerabilities could be remotely exploited to allow remote code execution, disclosure of information, server-side request forgery, authentication bypass, arbitrary file deletion, and directory traversal information disclosure vulnerabilities.”

The most severe vulnerability is an Authentication Bypass issue tracked as CVE-2025-37093 (CVSS score of 9,8). Earlier this June, the company also released updates to fix eight vulnerabilities in its StoreOnce data backup and deduplication solution that could result in an authentication bypass and remote code execution. It also shipped OneView version 10.00 to remediate a number of known flaws in third-party components, such as Apache Tomcat and Apache HTTP Server.

“They show a net financial benefit to DTE’s other customers,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission. He added that the agreements require upfront collateral from the tech companies. “The contract doesn’t assume the customer will stay financially solvent,” he said.

The rapid build-out of data centers in the US has transformed the energy industry, with growing controversy over facilities that can suck up as much electricity as entire cities. The conflict at the hearing Thursday underscores an increasingly hostile environment for data centers in some parts of the US.

The agreement between DTE and Oracle would have the tech firm paying the costs of the more the project. That would also include minimum monthly charges and a termination fee, according to a DTE filing. The developers are helping to finance the project with a roughly $14 billion debt deal, people familiar with the matter previously told Bloomberg News.

DTE and Oracle shares rose slightly and both ended up just under 1% on the day.

Citigroup Inc. noted the regulatory process was controversial and that the hyperscaler would be the first to lose power during a system emergency. “This should help avoid the potential scenario where the lights are on for Oracle’s data center while the public has a blackout,” analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

OpenAI has said the Stargate campus in Saline Township is part of its 8 gigawatts of planned capacity in the US and more than $450 billion in investment over the next three years that it’s previously announced with its broader set of Stargate partners. One gigawatt is equivalent to a traditional nuclear reactor.

Reuters reported that the FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand, citing people familiar with the matter. The agency declined to confirm the probe but said it was troubled by media reports describing Instacart's alleged pricing methods.

The scrutiny follows a recent study showing that prices for identical items at the same supermarkets can differ by about 7 percent when ordered through Instacart, potentially adding more than $1,000 a year to a customer's grocery bill. Instacart has said retailers, not the platform, ultimately set prices shown in the app.

Questions around pricing intensified after Instacart's 2022 acquisition of Eversight, an AI-based pricing and promotions firm. At the time, Instacart said the deal was intended to help retailers offer real-time savings opportunities.

Instacart declined to comment directly on the reported investigation, but said its pricing system has been misunderstood. The company said retail partners control pricing decisions and that any testing conducted is not dynamic or surveillance-based pricing. It said prices do not change in real time, are not tied to supply and demand, and are not based on personal or behavioral data, describing the process instead as randomized A/B testing similar to methods long used by retailers.

The issue has also drawn political attention. Earlier Wednesday, U.S. Representative Robert Garcia of California asked Instacart CEO Chris Rogers to provide details on how prices are set, saying algorithm-driven pricing could be worsening financial pressure on consumers.

On Thursday, CART closed at $44.95, down 1.53%, and is trading after hours at $44.94, off 0.02%, on the NasdaqGS.

The company has prominent partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash and is a retail investor favorite at the intersection of robotics and last-mile delivery.

Investors believe Serve’s robots can lower the cost of food deliveries by eliminating human couriers and make cities greener and safer by taking cars off the road. Management often argues that you “do not need a two-ton car to deliver a two-pound burrito.”

Serve started as an internal project within Postmates in 2017 and was spun out shortly after Uber acquired Postmates in December 2020. The company was listed on the NASDAQ through a reverse merger in April 2024 and faces intense competition from other robot delivery startups such as Starship, Nuro, Avride, and Coco Robotics. The company lost about $80 million on $2 million in revenue over the last twelve months, and its stock has about $100 million in average daily trading volume.

The Bear Cave believes Serve Robotics is a well-intentioned experiment with poor economics and a subpar solution for last-mile delivery.

Serve’s robots travel on public sidewalks and are not always treated with dignity and respect. In some cases, people flip the robots over for amusement or to steal the food carried inside.

Some of Serve’s problems are self-inflicted. A video posted on X last month by entrepreneur Nikhil Krishnan showed a Serve robot awkwardly forcing its way through a restaurant’s sidewalk seating while on a delivery. The post was captioned:

“There’s all these ground robots in Miami doing deliveries.

Seeing them in action makes me less bullish on these sidewalk robots as a form factor - people just don’t like dealing with them, they bully them (maintenance costs go up), and they’re slow.

Feel like the most likely end state is autonomous cars carrying food deliveries and drones for lighter ones.”

The Bear Cave spent hours observing Serve robots in our hometown of Brickell and reached a similarly negative conclusion.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sSy0!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82b55126-f537-48be-bf1f-9d63b0bb3d70_2500x1666.webp",N,,2025-12-18 18:04:54.082073

""There are more medicinal molecules out there than stars in the universe,” said Eli Lilly and Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Information and Digital Officer Diogo Rau from The Big Interview stage on December 4. “But finding one that works is about as rare as finding a single star in a galaxy, like finding one star in the Milky Way.” Researchers test molecules against hypotheses or known biological targets (like blocking a pain receptor) and see what works. They do that millions of times to find the single molecule that will lead to a health outcome.

But thanks to AI, we may be able to shrink that timeline—and end illness altogether.

AI as a Lab Partner

Equipment sterilization and worker safety notwithstanding, the trial-and-error process of developing new pharmaceutical products has been roughly unchanged for the better part of the last century. But according to Rau, AI is not only speeding up the timeline of discovery, but giving researchers new ways to approach it. Adding generative AI into the exploratory process of drug research has helped surface novel solutions. In fact, the first time Rau’s team used generative design on molecules, they produced some results that were promising, but unlike anything else the lab had ever come across. Intrigued, the team ran these experiments by Lilly staff chemists, and the response surprised Rau: “They said, 'That's interesting. We hadn't thought about doing it that way.' So the AI actually inspired the chemists to go down a different path that they hadn't been exploring.”

This series of events speaks to a broader shift happening throughout the professional world—human-machine collaboration. Just as knowledge workers in other industries have had to learn how to incorporate AI into their workflow to boost efficiency and drive faster results, the sciences are no different. ""We always talk about how we're training our machines,"" Rau said. “But there's a lot that they're going to teach us on the human side that we're going to go explore… not because we trained them, [but] because they're actually teaching us.”

An Efficiency Booster

In the early years of artificial intelligence research, one of the oft-stated benefits of AI was faster and more accurate results in medical labs and scientific research. While Lilly has been on the forefront of applying computing power to pharmaceutical challenges since becoming the first commercial purchaser of a Cray-2 supercomputer in 1989, a strategic partnership with a market leader in AI chips will enable them to unlock unprecedented gains in research volume. Coming online in January 2026, Lilly's new technology stack will use purpose-built models trained on internal data to launch scientific AI agents (digital assistants supporting researchers), push forward drug discovery research, and advance manufacturing operations via virtual modeling to fine-tune supply chains.

Critically, this custom-built LLM will learn from past and future molecular experiments. According to Rau, ""There are more medicinal molecules out there than stars in the universe, but finding one that works is about as rare as finding a single star in a galaxy, like finding one star in the Milky Way."" With this much computing power, the dream of finding cures for as-yet incurable diseases is tangible. Adding AI to the equation speeds up that timeline significantly. Rau said that on the first day their supercomputer is online, it will be 7 million times as powerful as the Cray-2 supercomputer.

That kind of hyper acceleration forever changes the time horizon for pharmaceutical companies and their output. Due to the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, pharmaceutical patents expire 20 years after their filing date, allowing generic drugs to hit the market. That puts drugmakers in a constant cycle of discovery, testing, and go-to-market. ""We've got to be focused on what we're going to discover,"" Rau said.

Installing Guardrails to Accelerate Growth

While this kind of accelerated pace may seem anathema to the slow progress of safe science, Rau notes that Lilly has built governance best practices into their systems at every level, building a platform-agnostic system with the capacity to utilize up to 43 large language models (LLMs), with guardrails to protect against issues like exposure of personally identifiable information. While today, developers build out new products and systems, according to Rau, “The real vision is [that] anybody in any role… can just go and talk to a large language model and have the guardrails and make everything work.”

A Moon Landing Moment

The pace and fervor of this innovation can have tangible results. Even without AI, the scientific community has eradicated smallpox globally and turned once-fatal diseases into manageable conditions. With the support of artificial intelligence working in collaboration with lab researchers and civil society, Rau envisions a dramatic future. In ten years, we expect to see new medicines that have been shaped by AI. ""But,"" he said, ""by the end of the century we essentially could be disease free as we know it."" That is the true promise of AI.","https://media.wired.com/photos/69418666b871f460797b4955/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/_45A9557_IcHreasd.jpeg",N,,2025-12-18 20:59:55.244073

Delivery company Instacart will pay $60 million in customer refunds under a settlement reached with the Federal Trade Commission over alleged deceptive practices.

The FTC said Thursday that Instacart has been falsely advertising free deliveries. The San Francisco-based company isn’t clearly disclosing service fees, which add as much as 15% to an order and must be paid for customers to receive their groceries, the FTC said.

Instacart has also failed to clearly disclose that customers who enroll in a free trial for its Instacart+ program will be charged membership fees at the end of the trial. The FTC said hundreds of thousands of customers have been charged but have received no benefits from memberships or refunds. Instacart+ offers members free deliveries on most orders for $99 per year.

The FTC said Instacart also advertises a “100% satisfaction guarantee,” but customers who experience late deliveries or unprofessional service are typically only offered a small credit that can be used toward a future order and not a refund.

“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.

Instacart denied the FTC’s allegations of wrongdoing Thursday but said it reached a settlement in order to move forward and focus on its business.

“Instacart is proud to offer a transparent, affordable and consumer-friendly service. We provide straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation and generous refund policies – all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms,” the company said in a statement.

The settlement comes as Instacart is facing a separate probe by the FTC into its pricing practices.

Earlier this month, a report by Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups — Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union — found that Instacart charged different prices for the same grocery items even though online shoppers were filling their Instacart baskets at the same time and at the same stores.

The report suggested that Instacart may be using artificial intelligence tools to drive up costs for consumers. Instacart confirmed Thursday that the FTC has requested information on its pricing tools and the pricing practice of the retailers it works with.

In its own blog post Thursday, Instacart stressed that it isn’t a retailer and doesn’t control base prices listed on its website. It said retailers often test prices in order to see how sensitive consumers are when prices go up or down, and that’s what was happening in Consumer Reports’ case.

Instacart also said the company and its retailers don’t use information about shoppers’ income, zip code or shopping history to set prices.

Instacart said it encourages retailers to charge the same amount on its website as they charge for in-store shoppers. Some retailers, including Lowe’s, Ulta Beauty and Best Buy, already do that, Instacart said, but many others don’t.",https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Instacart_Settlements_93661.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-12-18 17:04:50.542780

Key Points:

The targeted support regime is expected to take effect on 6 April 2026, and will allow firms to provide suggestions relating to pensions and investments designed for groups of consumers with common characteristics without attracting the full regulatory compliance burden of offering personalised advice.

The FCA also published a joint statement with the ICO explaining how firms will be able to actively promote their targeted support services in compliance with existing direct marketing rules under data protection law.

Introduction

On 11 December 2025, the FCA published a Policy Statement (PS25/22) containing its near-final rules on targeted support. While the rules are in substantially final form, they cannot be made by the FCA until the government passes legislation to make the necessary changes to the regulatory framework. However, the government issued a consultation response on its draft Statutory Instrument on the same date, indicating that both the government and the FCA intend for the regime to take effect in April 2026.

Targeted support will allow firms to provide suggestions relating to pensions and investments designed for groups of consumers with common characteristics without attracting the full regulatory compliance burden of offering personalised advice. There will be a new regulated activity for this service, distinct from “advising on investments”.

Authorised firms seeking to offer targeted support will need to apply for a variation of permissions to include this new activity. The FCA has suggested that, once the regime takes effect, it intends to grant permissions promptly to firms that have engaged with the regulator through the pre-application support service.

Legislative Framework

In its feedback on the draft Statutory Instrument, HM Treasury confirms that appointed representatives will not be able to deliver targeted support. However, HM Treasury states that it will review this position once broader reforms to the appointed representatives regime have been introduced and are well established. HM Treasury also confirms that, while certain exemptions and exclusions will apply to the new regulated activity, AIFMs and UCITS managers will need to apply for the separate regulatory permission if they want to offer targeted support.

FCA Requirements

The FCA consulted on its regulatory framework for targeted support in December 2024 and June 2025. The regulator proposed that firms would need to:

Identify consumer segments with shared financial support needs or objectives and, where relevant, common characteristics, in order to deliver suitable ready‑made suggestions.

Communicate the nature and limitations of targeted support as well as the common characteristics of the consumer segment when delivering targeted support.

Adhere to existing product governance rules.

Regularly review and monitor the outcomes of the targeted support service.

The FCA reports that it received more than 100 responses to its main consultation on targeted support. It states that there was strong support for its proposals, however, there were requests for clarification and refinement. Although the FCA has maintained much of the framework as initially consulted on, it has made a number of adjustments in light of the feedback, including:

Adding guidance to make clear that suitability does not need to be assessed at the individual consumer level when providing targeted support.

Clarifying that, when defining consumer segments, firms should not use a level of detail that equates to a comprehensive consideration of a consumer’s characteristics or circumstances. The FCA has also included new guidance to provide greater context around the requirement for sufficiently granular consumer segments.

Clarifying that assumptions can be used to limit the number of common characteristics used to define a segment. However, firms must not make assumptions which are material to the suitability of the suggestion. For example, willingness to take investment risk could be assumed for a particular segment, but only if it is not material to the suitability of the suggestion.

Simplifying the rules and guidance on firms’ obligations for ongoing monitoring of the targeted support service, recognising the one‑off nature of targeted support. For example, the FCA has clarified that firms are not required to check suitability on an ongoing basis, although they should consider whether the ready-made suggestion remains suitable for the predefined consumer segment as part of monitoring outcomes.

Amending the rules on product monitoring so that firms should only consider whether mitigating action is needed in response to a significant adaptation to a product. The FCA has also removed the requirement for firms to determine retrospectively whether a consumer acted on a ready‑made suggestion and to take mitigating action for that consumer in light of a significant adaptation, recognising that identifying such situations would be difficult for firms.

Requiring firms to explicitly call the service “Targeted Support” in any communications to consumers which contain ready‑made suggestions.

Adding guidance encouraging firms to keep a record of how they meet their disclosure obligations.

Narrowing its rules on cross-subsidisation so that firms can only accept payments that are reasonably representative of the costs of providing the service from companies in the same group. However, the FCA will not introduce a requirement for firms to disclose to consumers the basis of their remuneration arrangements, including cross‑subsidisation.

Providing Additional Clarity

Alongside the Policy Statement, the FCA published a joint statement with the Information Commissioner’s Office to explain how firms will be able to actively promote their targeted support services in compliance with existing direct marketing rules under data protection law. This is in response to concerns that direct marketing rules could restrict firms seeking to make targeted support communications. However, the FCA notes that legislative changes to the direct marketing rules would be a matter for the government to consider. HM Treasury has stated that it will make legislation to enable workplace pension providers to deliver targeted support communications to members who have not opted out of direct marketing.

The FCA also published a statement with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) setting out how the FOS and the FCA intend to work together regarding any future complaints about targeted support that have wider implications or that require clarification of FCA rules. The statement suggests that the FOS will seek a view from the FCA if issues of interpretation arise, as would be the case under planned reforms to the FOS, to ensure a consistent approach. This approach seems to be aimed at allaying concerns firms might have about potential mass redress issues while the government review of the redress system remains ongoing.

Next Steps

Subject to the necessary legislation being made, the regime will take effect on 6 April 2026. The FCA plans to open the authorisation gateway in March 2026, and is already offering assistance to firms through its pre-application support service. The FCA also states that it will publish further details on how firms should design consumer segments before the regime takes effect. Additionally, the FCA indicates that it intends to consult on changes to its perimeter guidance in the future to provide greater clarity on the advice guidance boundary more generally.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15361_4613.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:04:44.954706

In today’s issue:

▪ GOP moderates go around Johnson

▪ Trump touts record, $1,776 ‘Warrior Dividend’

▪ Bongino leaving FBI

▪ New Medicaid work requirements

A group of moderate House Republicans added to Speaker Mike Johnson‘s (R-La.) headaches when they joined with Democrats to force a vote on extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies.

The support from Pennsylvania GOP Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie and New York Rep. Mike Lawler gave Democrats’ discharge petition the key 218 signatures to force a vote on the House floor. The Democratic measure calls for an extension of the subsidies by three years.

The timing of the vote remains unclear. House rules set a waiting period before supporters of a discharge petition can call for the underlying bill to receive consideration on the House floor, and the chamber is set to leave for holiday recess through the rest of the year after Friday.

Johnson could call for a vote sooner, as he did after the success of another discharge petition last month forcing a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files. But he’s not required to do so.

The House on Wednesday night passed a partisan health care measure that includes a conservative alternative to extending the subsidies, but it has little chance of passing in the Senate.

The enhanced ACA subsidies are set to expire at the end of the month, and health insurance premiums could spike for more than 20 million Americans if they aren’t extended.

The final signatures on the petition backed by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats came after tensions reached a fever pitch between moderate Republicans supportive of extending the subsidies in some form and House GOP leadership.

GOP leaders and moderates had been discussing terms for bringing an amendment to the Republican health care proposal up for a vote to extend the subsidies, but Johnson declared Tuesday that no such vote would happen. Johnson said both sides were acting in “good faith,” but an agreement wasn’t reached.

That infuriated moderates who for weeks have been advocating for their party to back an extension of the subsidies with certain reforms.

Lawler called the decision “political malpractice” and “absolute bulls—.”

Fitzpatrick had put forward a separate discharge petition to extend the subsidies for two years with eligibility reforms, but that hasn’t gained much traction, leading him and others to back the Democrats’ petition.

“As I’ve stated many times before, the only policy that is worse than a clean three-year extension without any reforms, is a policy of complete expiration without any bridge,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “Unfortunately, it is House leadership themselves that have forced this outcome.”

The defections mark just the latest battle for Johnson, who has faced mounting criticism from members of his conference over his leadership.

The Speaker denied that he’s lost control of the conference after the rebellion from the moderates.

“We have the smallest majority in U.S. history. These are not normal times,” Johnson said. “There are processes and procedures in the House that are less frequently used when there are larger majorities.”

Lawler said his signing the petition isn’t an “indictment” of Johnson, recognizing that he has a “difficult” job dealing with all members of the House Republican Conference.

But it is the latest instance of Republicans undermining Johnson’s positions after months of the Speaker keeping most members in line.

To date, the defectors have mostly come from the conservative wing of the party. Four House Republicans sided with Democrats to force a vote on the Epstein files.

Meanwhile, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) is gathering signatures to force a vote on banning stock trading among members of Congress and their families.

And now Johnson has moderates splitting with him as well.

▪ The Hill: Moderate GOP rebels plan next steps on subsidies.

▪ The Hill: Republican senators frustrated with Johnson’s handling of health care.

MODS POLL WELL: One data point out this morning that may help moderates’ case that their path is the way to go is a new Emerson College Polling survey looking at hypothetical 2028 presidential match-ups.

The poll shows moderates from both parties lead opponents from the more extreme ends. Respondents said they preferred a moderate Republican over a progressive Democrat by 12 points and backed a moderate Democrat over a MAGA Republican by 9 points.

A moderate Republican also had a 5-point advantage over a moderate Democrat, while a progressive Democrat led a MAGA Republican by 1 point.

“It is clear that a moderate candidate on both the Democratic and Republican side has appeal toward independent voters that a label of progressive or MAGA does not appeal to: the ‘moderate Democrat’ has a 17-point advantage over the MAGA Republican and the ‘moderate Republican’ has an 18-point advantage over the ‘progressive Democrat,’” said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling.

Johnson said Wednesday that he has not lost control of the House after several Republicans crossed over to sign a Democratic-led discharge petition to extend ACA tax credits for three years. However, calls for leadership are coming from both sides of the aisle.

“I hope that the Speaker takes a different approach in the new year,” Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) told me, speaking about the increasing number of discharge petitions, a way for members to gather enough signatures to bring any vote to the floor.

“It’s not just the House and Senate. The president’s got to take a leadership role on this as well,” Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) told me as well in a joint interview with Kiley.

Johnson noted the historically small majority. He’s not wrong. However, every day that goes by is a day closer to the November midterm elections, where members will start to look at their own races. We could be gearing up for a term where discharge petitions are a feature and not a bug.

3 Things to Know Today

1. The federal government has admitted fault in the January crash between an airliner and a Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.

2. The State Department announced it is sending a package of arms sales worth more than $10 billion to Taiwan. It includes medium-range missiles, drones and military software.

3. The annual national defense policy bill has reached President Trump’s desk after the Senate signed off on the bipartisan, $901 billion spending package for fiscal 2026. It includes a pay bump for service members, additional military aid for Ukraine and a rollback of sanctions on Syria — and a provision pushing for unedited footage of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Leading the Day

TRUMP ADDRESS: President Trump took his case directly to the American people Wednesday night when he promoted his accomplishments as his first year back in office is almost over.

Speaking from the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House, Trump argued he inherited a poor economy from former President Biden and has turned it around over the past 11 months, lowering costs and stopping the flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S.

The 18-minute speech marked a continuation of the president’s attempt to tie the country’s problems to his predecessor while portraying his own administration as turning things around. He pointed to the cost of eggs, gasoline, airfare and hotel rates coming down, investments from foreign trade deals and revenue coming in because of his wide-ranging tariffs.

Trump also announced his administration would send “Warrior Divided” checks worth $1,776 to more than 1.4 million U.S. service members and hinted at rolling out major housing reform initiatives next year.

But polls have continued to show most Americans don’t approve of his handling of the economy and believe he is more to blame for its status than Biden.

A PBS News/NPR/Marist poll released Wednesday showed only 36 percent of respondents said they approve of his handling of the issue, the lowest percentage recorded in either of his two terms.

▪ The Hill: Five takeaways from Trump’s speech.

HOUSE PASSES TRANS BILL: The House has narrowly passed a bill sponsored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) that would criminalize gender-affirming care for minors.

The chamber approved the legislation Wednesday in a mostly party-line vote, with all but four Republicans voting in favor and all but three Democrats voting against. The vote came after Greene reached a deal with House Republican leadership last week to bring her bill to the floor in exchange for her supporting a vote to advance the NDAA.

“We need to let kids grow up without manipulation from adults to make life altering decisions! Congress must protect America’s children!!!” Greene wrote on X before the vote.

The bill has almost no chance of advancing in the Senate, where it would need Democratic support to pass.

GRANT FUNDING CUT: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has terminated seven grants worth millions of dollars for the American Academy of Pediatrics, citing its use of “identity-based language,” The Washington Post reported.

The Post reported the decision surprised professionals at the organization, which has been among the sharpest critics of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‘s changes to federal vaccine recommendations.

A spokesperson for the department told the outlet the grants were cut for the organization, along with others, because they “no longer align” with HHS’s mission or priorities.

The academy warned the withdrawal of the funds could harm infants, youth and their families across the country.

HEADING TOWARD THE EXIT: FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino plans to step down from his role in January after less than a year on the job.

Bongino announced his decision Wednesday in a post on the social platform X, thanking Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel for the opportunity to serve.

Trump had indicated earlier that Bongino was interested in returning to being a conservative commentator, the role he held for years before becoming the second-highest-ranking official in the FBI. Bongino developed a major following during Trump’s first term through his radio show, podcast and appearances on Fox News.

But he reportedly clashed with Bondi over the release of the Epstein files and had misgivings about the job. He was reported to have mulled about leaving months ago, and speculation about his potential exit picked up again in August, when Trump tapped then-Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as co-deputy director.

FCC INDEPENDENCE: Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr suggested the agency he leads isn’t independent from Trump’s administration during an intense back-and-forth with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D) pressed Carr about the agency’s responsibility to conduct oversight of major media companies without considering how members of the administration, including the president, feel about their content.

Luján noted the FCC website called the agency “independent.” But Carr argued the Communications Act of 1934, which established the FCC, didn’t include protections for commissioners to only be relieved of their position for cause.

“So formally speaking, the FCC is not independent,” he said.

The website later removed the word “independent” from its “About” section after Carr’s testimony.

The chair’s comments came as part of a grilling he received from Senate Democrats who accused him of trying to coerce local affiliate broadcasters to scrutinize content critical of Trump.

They also slammed him over the brief suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, who was taken off the air on ABC in September over comments he made regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Carr had suggested local affiliates should refuse to air Kimmel’s show before the suspension was enacted.

Kimmel’s suspension was criticized by members across the aisle, and Carr caught heat from some Republicans for his role, including Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee.

Carr defended himself, arguing local affiliates are “obligated” to scrutinize news and entertainment content that doesn’t “serve the public interest.”

NASA ADMINISTRATOR CONFIRMED: The Senate confirmed Jared Isaacman to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) after a roller-coaster road for him.

Isaacman’s confirmation passed comfortably in a 67-to-30 vote, but it came after his initial nomination was pulled and he was renominated last month. Trump withdrew the nomination for Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and close ally of Elon Musk, in May amid the president’s feud with the Tesla CEO.

Isaacman will take over leadership of NASA for Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who had been serving as interim administrator since July.

Trump has set a goal for NASA to return humans to the moon before China does. Isaacman has proposed a plan of increasing competition among private-sector entities as part of the effort.

▪ Florida Today: What to expect as Isaacman becomes NASA head.

NEW PROFILE PIC: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has embraced a photo of himself from a Vanity Fair article, which shows him looking down while standing in a corner.

Rubio made it his profile picture on X after accusing the outlet of having “deliberately manipulated” photos and content in its story.

MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS: Nebraska is set to become the first state to implement new work requirements for Medicaid in line with Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The legislation, which Trump signed into law earlier this year, requires low-income residents between the ages of 19 and 64 to work or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month to remain eligible for Medicaid benefits. The requirements only apply to those who received Medicaid through an expansion under the ACA that raised the income limit for qualification.

The law requires states to enact work requirements by 2027, but states can take action sooner.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen (R) said the goal is not to “take everybody to the curb” but ensure “we get every able-bodied Nebraskan to be part of our community,” The Associated Press reported.

The law permits exemptions for pregnant women, homeless people, those recently released from incarceration, those receiving addiction treatment, disabled people and parents and guardians of children younger than 14 years old.

All beneficiaries who are eligible because of the expansion must submit paperwork demonstrating they are meeting the requirements every six months or risk losing coverage.

AP reported the new policies could cause 4.5 million people to be uninsured by 2027.

NEWSHOUSE RETIRING: Rep. Dan Newhouse (Wash.), one of the two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, announced he won’t seek reelection to another term next year.

Newhouse made the announcement Wednesday after having represented his central Washington district since 2015. He fended off two Trump-backed primary challenges in 2022 and 2024 over his vote in favor of impeachment, in which he was one of 10 Republicans to do so.

Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.

Newhouse’s district is solidly conservative, having voted for Trump by 20 points last year.

With his retirement, California Rep. David Valadao (R) would be the only remaining House Republican who backed impeachment.

Elsewhere

RUSSIA MEETING: U.S. and Russian officials are reportedly planning to meet this weekend in Miami as part of the latest round of talks to try to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end.

Two people familiar with the matter told Politico of the plan, which remains up in the air but would include administration officials presenting the result of the most recent negotiations with Ukraine to the Russian officials. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner are expected to be present.

Senior U.S. officials have indicated that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed on most of the terms for a potential peace deal to end the war after nearly four years of fighting. One major development from the recent talks is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appeared to back off on insisting Ukraine join NATO, expressing openness to a similar mutual defense pact without joining the alliance.

The administration has signaled it believes it can get Russia to agree to the security guarantees.

But the major remaining issue is over control of land, with Zelensky refusing to give up any Ukrainian territory, including area currently under Russian occupation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that the Kremlin remains prepared to take Ukraine by military force if the negotiations fail.

He began his journey in agencies such as DDB and Publicis, where he worked as a copywriter and later as a creative director, developing award-winning work recognised nationally and internationally.

Today, Leo’s work sits precisely where behaviours, platforms and culture meet. He focuses on shaping ideas that tap into how people already interact, across digital ecosystems, social behaviours or unexpected real world moments, and on helping teams think in systems rather than isolated assets.

​

PERSON

I’ve always felt my creativity comes from living in two modes at once. One part of me is introverted, quiet and observant, the kind of person who notices the exact moment someone loosens their shoulders, or how a background colour suddenly completes a scene when someone walks by wearing the perfect contrasting shade. Those tiny signals become raw material I collect without even trying. But when I feel at ease, another part of me appears: the playful, collaborative one that turns those silent observations into ideas. My creativity lives in the tension between those two instincts.

There’s a cartoon by the Venezuelan artist Eneko hanging in my studio that reads: ‘You have to grow, so the child inside you will have more space to play.’ That’s exactly how I experience life and creativity. I approach the work with responsibility, but I approach ideas with curiosity. Creativity needs room to play, to explore, to make something out of nothing.

But that space doesn’t sustain itself. I’ve learned I need habits and iteration to protect it, while being careful to leave breathing room inside the structure. Too much routine makes the work predictable; too little makes it unfocused. I try to live in the middle: enough discipline to move forward, enough openness to be surprised.

And even though I enjoy what I do, most of my inspiration lives outside advertising: in music, photography, design, social media, video games. Those worlds still surprise me. And that surprise is always where my ideas begin.

PRODUCT

When I look at a piece of work, I pay attention to how it makes me feel, to the impression it leaves behind. Sometimes it’s: ‘I wasn’t expecting this.’ Other times: ‘Of course! This is exactly how it should be.’ And sometimes it’s that quiet frustration of: ‘I should’ve thought of this.’ That emotional trace tells me more than any formal criteria.

I’m drawn to ideas that find a new angle without shouting for attention. Work that feels culturally grounded, honest, scalable and fluent in how people actually speak. Ideas that aren’t trying to conquer the world, but reveal something that was already there.

My criteria have changed over time. When I was younger, I cared more about the clever twist for its own sake. Now I think much more about where and how an idea reaches someone. If a message appears in a place where people already feel comfortable (a behaviour, a platform, a ritual) it has a far better chance of being believed, felt and shared. An idea doesn’t need to demand attention; it just needs to belong.

What excites me most is work that becomes part of culture instead of interrupting it. Ideas that ‘hack the platform,’ that slip into real behaviours, the kind anyone could have made if they had noticed the same cultural loophole. Those ideas feel alive.

To me, the industry today moves between two impulses: work that tries to create meaning and work that tries to achieve metrics. Both matter, but only the first one leaves something that lasts. Culture remembers what feels true.

PROCESS

After reading a brief, the first thing I try to understand is where the idea could actually live. I look for the platform, the moment or the behaviour where the message would feel natural, a place where the brand can enter the conversation without forcing it. Finding that ‘home’ early on helps me see the creative potential more clearly and shapes everything long before I think about executions.

From there, I focus on how the message might resonate. I pay attention to the emotional tone of the moment, to how people are behaving, to what feels honest right now. I’m not chasing ideas yet; I’m trying to sense what kind of idea would feel true. Once I find that alignment, that ‘platform hack’, the creative process starts moving almost on its own.

When the idea itself begins to take shape, my process shifts depending on whether I’m working alone or with a partner. When I’m alone, I let the thoughts move freely: I write fragments, test tiny angles, walk while everything rearranges itself. I use AI like a wide-angle lens, to map possibilities, uncover blind spots, and stretch the idea before committing to anything.

With a partner, the process becomes shared. It stops being ‘your idea’ or ‘my idea’ and naturally becomes ‘our idea.’ Conversations replace internal monologues, contradictions sharpen thinking, and two perspectives start building a single direction in real time. It’s not about merging two processes; it’s about creating a new one together.

I know a piece is ready when it fits naturally into the space I identified at the start. If it feels authentic there, not like an interruption, but like something that truly belongs, something users in that space could have made themselves, then it’s ready.

PRESS

I grew up in Caracas, in a home where curiosity was part of everyday life. My father, an art critic, filled our days with books, exhibitions and conversations about meaning. My mother, a chemist specialised in paper conservation, taught me to value precision and how even the smallest, invisible detail can change everything. That mix of emotional and analytical thinking shaped how I approach creativity today.

Venezuela influenced me in quieter ways. Not through chaos, but through a cultural instinct for resourcefulness. Improvisation is part of the Venezuelan DNA. Watching how people solve the everyday with ingenious, simple solutions taught me to appreciate ideas that are intuitive and culturally sharpened.

Silence has always been the place where I think best. Today, music plays a big role in how I work. When I go on photo walks through Madrid, music acts like a filter. It isolates me just enough from the environment to see it with a bit of distance. That distance helps me notice moments that vanish when you’re too immersed: a shadow aligning with a colour, a gesture that tells a story, two strangers mirroring each other without realising it. Photography taught me to capture what disappears; music helps me detach just enough to recognise it.

Those early influences shaped how I work with clients, too. I’ve learned that clarity is one of the most powerful forces in any creative project. A brief overloaded with objectives dilutes ideas instantly. A focused intention, on the other hand, gives creativity something meaningful to respond to.

Inside agencies, culture matters as much as talent. People do their best work when they feel confident, when iteration is welcomed, and when there’s space to think. Creativity needs freedom, yes, but it also needs an environment where that freedom can turn into something real.",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2025-12/Leo-Sierra-VML.MmKJ1-HW.png,N,,2025-12-18 21:00:16.504381

As America industrialized and moved away from an agricultural economy, people faced more demands on their time.

Market Update

The Fed’s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election.

Operations are scheduled to begin in 2032.

""By establishing this new facility, Lilly is deepening America's expertise in advanced chemical synthesis and setting new standards for sustainable manufacturing,"" said Edgardo Hernandez, executive vice president and president of Lilly Manufacturing Operations. ""Our investment not only expands our technical capabilities but also reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship, leveraging innovative processes to minimize waste and achieve carbon neutrality. Each step forward strengthens our U.S. operations and supports healthier communities for the future.""

To support the project AIDT, Alabama’s primary workforce development agency, will assist Lilly with an on-site training center and provide help in assembling and training the workforce.

“The competition for a manufacturing facility of this magnitude is extremely challenging, and this result shows Alabama’s pro-business climate, outstanding workforce and strong community support is a winning combination,” noted Ellen McNair, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

In line with this, the announcement of the acquisition of SpectraWAVE by Philips signals a strategic push to deepen clinical decision-making capabilities, expand procedural adoption, and reinforce leadership in a market shaped by cardiovascular disease prevalence, aging populations, and the growing imperative for data-driven intervention accuracy, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

The technology SpectraWAVE develops specializes in advanced intravascular imaging and physiological assessment to diagnose and guide treatment for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

GlobalData forecasts the global intravascular ultrasound catheters (IVUS) market to see a steady market value growth at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% during the 2024-2034.

Philips currently accounts for 88% of the global market share for IVUS devices. North America is the largest market for IVUS medical devices, with a market value of $490 million. GlobalData predicts the North American IVUS market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6% during the forecast period.

Thomas Fleming, Medical Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The demand for IVUS medical devices stems from the increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) due to aging populations and a high rate of smoking in some countries. A worldwide increase in healthcare spending will also drive the market. However, the high cost of imaging techniques and a lack of heart specialty hospitals in some regions will act as barriers to the adoption of IVUS based procedures.”

The acquisition of SpectraWAVE will include the HyperVue Imaging System with AI-supported imaging inside the coronary arteries and X1-FFR, an AI-enabled angio-based FFR technology. X1-FFR provides a direct feed from angiography systems, which can be used by clinicians in finding the correct location for stent placements and other intervention. The acquisition will expand Philips’ current intravascular imaging and physiological assessment device portfolio, which includes OmniWire iFR technology and Eagle Eye Platinum IVUS.

The announcement of Philip’s acquisition of SpectraWAVE follows the earlier development of 501k clearance for SpectraWAVE’s Hypervue Intravascular Imagine System in 2023, $50 million of Series B funding for SpectraWAVE in September d2024, and SpectraWAVE gaining FDA clearance for X1-FFR in October 2025.

Fleming concludes: “The coupling of SpectraWAVE’s new technologies with Philips’ existing catalogue of products and market influence will potentially increase the adoption rates of IVUS based procedures. The burgeoning application of AI in medical technology will provide new innovations for IVUS technology as well as for the cardiovascular and diagnostic imaging sectors in general.”",https://www.globaldata.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GD-logo-vector_RGB-02-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 19:02:12.050785

Infant botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria.","The Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to Target, Walmart, Albertsons and Kroger, saying their stores nationwide were still selling recalled products linked to a deadly botulism outbreak.

The warning letters are part of a major, multi-state baby formula recall initiated in August from the brand ByHeart. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 51 infants across 19 states developed botulism after being fed ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, and an investigation remains ongoing.

The letters, sent Friday, stated that despite the recall, the products remained available for purchase on shelves through at least November, and ""well after the recall was initiated and expanded"" and despite multiple notifications.

""As a participant in the supply chain, your firm should take prompt and effective action when notified of a product recall,"" each of the letters said. ""Once your firm has been made aware of a recall or potential safety issue, you should take action to immediately remove the affected product from distribution and sale, cease all further shipment or use, and implement all necessary measures to prevent further exposure to consumers or downstream distribution.""

According the FDA, the recalled products remained on shelves in at least 20 Target stores. In one instance single-serve packs of the recalled formula was marked with a promotional ""Sale!"" sign, the FDA said.

""State and local partners reported several explanations offered by Target store associates for the continued presence of the recalled product, including lack of awareness of the recall notice, confusion regarding which specific lots were affected, failure to remove all impacted product, and stocking products that arrived after the recall notification,"" the letter said.

Local

The FDA also said the tainted formula remained on shelves at Albertsons' stores across 11 states, including Jewel-Osco grocery stores. At Walmart, the products were on shelves across 21, states, the FDA said, and at Kroger-owned stores across 10 states.

The letter advises the stores to contact the FDA in writing within 15 days detailing the steps taken to address the violations. NBC Chicago reached out to Target, Kroger, Albertsons and Walmart for comment.

What Is Infant Botulism?

Infant botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. According to the FDA, symptoms may include:

Constipation

Poor feeding

Drooping eyelids

Sluggish pupils

Low muscle tone

Difficulty sucking or swallowing

Weak or altered cry

Generalized weakness

Respiratory difficulty or arrest

The FDA warns that infant botulism can be fatal if not treated promptly.

Impact on Formula Supply

ByHeart's formula accounts for less than 1% of all infant formula sold in the U.S., and the FDA says the recall is not expected to affect nationwide supply or contribute to a formula shortage.

Are Other Brands Involved?

Since August, the FDA has received 83 reports of botulism potentially tied to infant formula. NBC 5 has asked the agency for the names of other brands involved, but no additional information has been released.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2023/11/image-97.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-12-18 16:01:35.069879

What Comes Next: The 2026 Window and Beyond Looking toward 2026, the success of the Waterstones/Barnes & Noble IPO will depend heavily on the macroeconomic environment and the continued cooling of inflation.
The Final Chapter for 2025 The influence of institutional investors like Elliott Management has fundamentally altered the trajectory of the retail market.","As the financial world closes out 2025, a significant shift in the retail landscape is taking center stage. Elliott Management, the powerhouse investment firm known for its aggressive activist campaigns, is reportedly moving into the final stages of preparing a multibillion-pound initial public offering (IPO) for its consolidated bookselling empire: Waterstones and Barnes & Noble. This move, expected to materialize in the second half of 2026, represents more than just a private equity exit; it is a high-stakes bet that physical, curated retail has not only survived the ""Amazon apocalypse"" but has emerged as a premium asset class for institutional investors.

The potential listing, which sources indicate will likely favor the London Stock Exchange over New York, comes at a time when the broader IPO market is finally showing signs of life after a prolonged freeze. By positioning these legacy brands as ""dividend-paying retail champions,"" Elliott is signaling a strategic pivot in how institutional capital views the high street. This event marks a definitive end to the era of retail ""doom-loop"" narratives, replacing them with a blueprint for operational excellence and community-focused commerce.

A Turnaround for the Books: The Path to Public Markets

The journey to this potential 2026 IPO began in 2018 when Elliott Management acquired Waterstones, followed by the 2019 acquisition of Barnes & Noble. At the time, the moves were met with skepticism; the rise of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) seemed to have rendered large-scale physical bookselling obsolete. However, Elliott’s strategy centered on a single, unconventional hire: James Daunt. As the CEO of both chains, Daunt dismantled the centralized, ""big-box"" corporate model, empowering local store managers to curate their own inventories and transform shops into community hubs.

The results have been nothing short of transformative. As of December 2025, the combined entity is reporting approximately $400 million in annual profit on $3 billion in sales. Barnes & Noble alone opened 67 new stores in 2025—the highest number in decades—with plans for another 60 in 2026. To streamline the business for the public markets, Elliott oversaw the sale of Barnes & Noble’s publishing arm, Union Square & Co, to Hachette Book Group in late 2024. This allowed the company to focus exclusively on its retail strengths, a move that has resonated with institutional analysts who favor ""pure-play"" investments.

Initial market reactions have been cautiously optimistic. The successful $6.26 billion IPO of Medline earlier this month has served as a bellwether, proving that there is significant investor appetite for profitable, private-equity-backed businesses with stable cash flows. In London, the prospect of a Waterstones listing is being hailed as a much-needed victory for the exchange, which has struggled to attract high-profile retail listings in recent years.

Winners and Losers in the Reimagined Retail Space

Elliott Management stands as the primary winner in this scenario, poised to realize a massive return on an investment that many deemed too risky six years ago. By successfully navigating the ""James Daunt effect,"" Elliott has demonstrated that institutional investors can do more than just strip assets; they can revitalize them. Conversely, Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (NYSE: BNED)—a separate public entity that manages college bookstores—continues to face volatility, highlighting the stark contrast between the thriving retail arm and the more challenged academic sector.

For Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the resurgence of Barnes & Noble represents a rare check on its dominance. While the e-commerce giant still controls roughly half of the U.S. print book market, the ""discovery"" experience of a physical B&N store has become a competitive moat that algorithms have yet to replicate. Publishing giants like News Corp (NASDAQ: NWSA), which owns HarperCollins, and Pearson plc (NYSE: PSO) also stand to benefit. A healthy, expanding physical retail footprint provides these publishers with essential shelf space for ""mid-list"" authors who often get lost in the infinite scroll of online marketplaces.

However, the ""losers"" in this shift may be the smaller, independent bookstores that lack the scale and institutional backing of an Elliott-funded giant. While the ""BookTok"" trend has boosted the entire industry, the aggressive expansion of B&N into suburban markets—often opening stores directly across from independents—could lead to a consolidation of the ""experience-led"" retail market, leaving smaller players squeezed by the very trends they helped start.

The Broader Institutional Shift: From Real Estate to ""Experience""

The Elliott move is not an isolated incident but part of a wider trend of institutional activism reshaping the retail sector in 2024 and 2025. We are seeing a divergence in strategy: some activists are focusing on real estate monetization, while others, like Elliott, are betting on operational revitalization. For instance, Macy's, Inc. (NYSE: M) has spent much of 2025 fending off pressure from Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital to unlock the value of its massive real estate portfolio, valued at nearly $9 billion. Similarly, Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) remains under pressure from Vision One Management Partners to explore a sale or spin-off of its store assets.

In contrast, Elliott’s recent $1 billion+ stake in Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU) mirrors its Barnes & Noble strategy—focusing on leadership and brand revitalization rather than just asset stripping. This ""Experience-Led"" model is also evident in the blockbuster merger of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, backed by Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE: APO). That deal notably included minority investments from Amazon and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE: CRM), signaling that even tech giants recognize the value of physical luxury retail when backed by institutional discipline and AI-driven personalization.

This shift suggests that institutional investors are moving away from the ""retail is dead"" mantra toward a more nuanced ""retail is evolving"" thesis. The focus is now on companies that can offer what the digital world cannot: a ""third place"" for social interaction and sensory engagement. The regulatory implications are also significant; as these large, institutionally-backed entities grow, we may see increased scrutiny from antitrust regulators concerned about the consolidation of physical retail power.

What Comes Next: The 2026 Window and Beyond

Looking toward 2026, the success of the Waterstones/Barnes & Noble IPO will depend heavily on the macroeconomic environment and the continued cooling of inflation. If the listing proceeds as planned in the second half of the year, it will likely set a valuation benchmark for other private-equity-owned retail assets. We may see a ""follow-the-leader"" effect, where firms like Permira or Roark Capital look to the public markets for their own retail portfolios, such as Golden Goose or Subway.

Strategic pivots will be required for the combined bookselling entity as it enters the public sphere. Investors will be looking for a clear digital strategy that complements, rather than competes with, the physical stores. The integration of advanced data analytics—perhaps through partnerships similar to the Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) involvement in the Saks-Neiman deal—will be crucial for maintaining the ""curated"" feel at a public-company scale. The challenge for James Daunt will be maintaining the ""indie"" spirit of his stores while answering to the quarterly demands of public shareholders.

The Final Chapter for 2025

The influence of institutional investors like Elliott Management has fundamentally altered the trajectory of the retail market. By applying a combination of rigorous financial discipline and a deep respect for the ""craft"" of bookselling, Elliott has created a blueprint for how legacy brands can thrive in the 21st century. The upcoming IPO is not just an exit strategy; it is a validation of the idea that physical stores are a vital part of the modern social and economic fabric.

As we move into 2026, investors should keep a close eye on the formal filing dates for the Waterstones/B&N listing and monitor the performance of other activist-targeted retailers like Macy's and Lululemon. The ""Elliott Playbook"" has proven that with the right leadership and a focus on customer experience, even the most ""outdated"" industries can become market darlings once again. The next twelve months will determine if this retail renaissance is a permanent shift or a well-timed exit by some of the world's most sophisticated capital managers.

It's a case of second time lucky for J&J, as the FDA turned down its first marketing application for the subcutaneous variant of Rybrevant (amivantamab) last year due to manufacturing quality concerns.
That was seen as a major setback to J&J's stated ambition to grow the drug into a $5 billion-a-year blockbuster.
The green light for Rybrevant Faspro – which combines amivantamab with hyaluronidase – means that the drug is the first subcutaneous therapy cleared by the FDA for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and reduces dosing time from hours to minutes with reduced administration-related reactions, according to J&J.
So far, the growth of Rybrevant has been held back by complicated administration that sometimes needs split dosing, prolonged infusion times, and side effects – now overcome by Rybrevant Faspro – and J&J is now expecting sales to accelerate.","Johnson & Johnson has claimed FDA approval for Rybrevant Faspro, a subcutaneous version of its EGFRxMET bispecific antibody, for all the indications approved for the current, intravenous formulation.

The green light for Rybrevant Faspro – which combines amivantamab with hyaluronidase – means that the drug is the first subcutaneous therapy cleared by the FDA for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and reduces dosing time from hours to minutes with reduced administration-related reactions, according to J&J.

The IV formulation of Rybrevant has four FDA approvals in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory EGFR-mutated NSCLC – as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs, including chemotherapy and J&J's companion EGFR inhibitor Lazcluze (lazertinib).

It has been billed as a major competitor to market-leading EGFR inhibitor Tagrisso (osimertinib) from AstraZeneca, which is dosed orally. Tagrisso made sales of $5.8 billion last year but was bested by the Rybrevant/Lazcluze in the MARIPOSA trial on the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).

So far, the growth of Rybrevant has been held back by complicated administration that sometimes needs split dosing, prolonged infusion times, and side effects – now overcome by Rybrevant Faspro – and J&J is now expecting sales to accelerate. In the third quarter, the combined turnover of Rybrevant and Lazcluze reached $198 million, driven by the MARIPOSA readout.

The approval of the subcutaneous version comes on the back of the PALOMA-3 and improved clinical outcomes trial, which showed equivalence with IV Rybrevant at achieving blood levels of amivantamab and improved clinical outcomes, including extended overall survival (OS).

AZ has hit back with a recent approval for Tagrisso in combination with chemotherapy, which seems to have matched Rybrevant on PFS and OS in the FLAURA2 trial, and the two companies are now engaged in a marketing battle to extol the virtues of their respective datasets in the frontline setting.

""Patients now have a simple, chemotherapy-free frontline option that not only targets the disease more precisely but also significantly improves survival,"" commented Joelle Fathi, chief healthcare delivery officer for the GO2 for Lung Cancer patient advocacy organisation.

""This therapy reduces the physical and emotional burden of lengthy infusions, giving patients and their families the opportunity to reclaim precious moments and focus on living, rather than treatment,"" she added.",https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/2025-12/Rybrevant_Faspro_pack_1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:04:40.619108

The savings accounts, set to launch next July for children with a U.S. Social Security number, were introduced earlier this year as part of Trump’s tax bill. Babies born between 2025 and 2028 will automatically receive a $1,000 deposit from the U.S. Treasury Department. All children under the age of 18 are eligible to open an account.

The government is encouraging parents, philanthropists and local governments to contribute to the tax-advantaged accounts, which can be invested in stock market index funds and later convert into traditional IRAs when recipients turn 18. Funds can eventually be used for expenses such as education, job training and buying a first home.

Dalio, whose net worth is estimated at $15.4 billion, praised the accounts as a tool for building financial literacy among children. “These Trump Accounts are great not just because they put money into stocks for these young people but also because they draw their attention toward how finance, stocks, companies and capitalism work to improve society and can work for them,” he wrote in a post on X yesterday (Dec. 17).

His announcement mirrors a similar contribution from Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Earlier this month, the couple unveiled a $6.25 million donation that will place $250 into the Trump accounts of 25 million children aged ten and under who aren’t eligible for the Treasury’s seed deposit.

The Dalios and the Dells have collaborated philanthropically before. In 2020, the Dalios purchased 60,000 Dell laptops to support virtual education during the Covid pandemic. Dalio’s broader charitable efforts also include more than $7 million in contributions to Dalio Philanthropies, his family foundation, as well as roughly $280 million donated to nonprofits in Connecticut.

The Dalios’ support for Trump accounts also ties into a new component of the initiative known as the “50 State Challenge” which aims to encourage philanthropists to expand funding in their local communities. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the program during a press conference yesterday. “Ray has made the first move, but we welcome other donors and foundations in Connecticut and across the country to join him,” Bessent said, adding that 20 state governments are also in talks about supplementing the accounts.

The government has also launched trumpaccounts.gov, a website dedicated to the initiative that highlights “additional support” from at least eight companies nationwide. In most cases, corporate participation has taken the form of matching government contributions, with companies such as Dell, BNY and BlackRock pledging to supplement the Treasury’s $1,000 deposits for their employees’ children.

Not every billionaire, however, is convinced. While calling the accounts a “nice gesture,” Elon Musk took to X yesterday to describe the initiative as unnecessary in light of A.I.’s economic potential.

“There will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income,” Musk wrote, echoing a Silicon Valley belief that technology-driven productivity gains will eventually provide people with steady, recurring payouts.",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/GettyImages-2243629590.jpg?quality=80,N,,2025-12-18 15:01:54.121142

READ NEXT: 30 Stocks That Should Double in 3 Years and 11 Hidden AI Stocks to Buy NOW","We came across a bullish thesis on Levi Strauss & Co. on Paradox’s Substack by Paradox Intelligence. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LEVI. Levi Strauss & Co.'s share was trading at $22.55 as of December 16th. LEVI’s trailing and forward P/E were 16.75 and 15.17 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) is emerging as a prime beneficiary of a structural shift back toward premium denim, supported by compelling consumer search data that suggests demand is durable rather than fashion-cycle driven. As the world’s largest branded apparel company and a global leader in jeanswear, Levi’s operates across more than 110 countries and generates roughly $6.2 billion in annual revenue through wholesale, direct-to-consumer, and e-commerce channels.

Alternative data indicates that consumer interest in denim has rebounded meaningfully, with Google searches for Levi’s jeans up 59% year over year, overall Levi’s brand searches up 52%, and category-level denim searches up 25%, all reaching five-year highs. This momentum has accelerated throughout 2025 and reflects converging tailwinds such as return-to-office trends, Y2K-inspired styles, and a preference for versatile, utility-oriented apparel that aligns with Levi’s heritage positioning.

High-intent e-commerce indicators reinforce this signal, with Amazon searches for Levi’s up 47% year over year and Google Shopping searches surging 94%, suggesting elevated conversion intent rather than casual browsing. Importantly, these search trends correlate strongly with operational performance. Levi’s Q3 2025 results exceeded expectations, with revenue of $1.54 billion growing 7% year over year, gross margins expanding to 61.7%, and EPS of $0.34 beating consensus. The company has now delivered 12 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, while direct-to-consumer sales rose 11% and e-commerce grew 16%, highlighting successful digital execution.

Strategically, Levi’s premium positioning and culturally resonant marketing, exemplified by its “REIIMAGINE” campaign with Beyoncé, have translated into tangible results, including 12% growth in women’s denim. Management’s decision to raise full-year guidance underscores confidence in sustained momentum. Overall, the breadth and intensity of consumer search growth provide a buffer against execution risks and support a probability-weighted outlook of continued outperformance into mid-2026.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on V.F. Corporation (VFC) by Fun-Imagination-2488 in April 2025, which highlighted the turnaround under new leadership, brand revitalization efforts, margin recovery, and debt reduction. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 62.84% since our coverage. This is because the turnaround execution gained investor confidence. The thesis still stands as operational discipline continues. Paradox Intelligence shares a similar thesis but emphasizes alternative data and demand-led momentum.

Levi Strauss & Co. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 37 hedge fund portfolios held LEVI at the end of the third quarter which was 36 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of LEVI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LEVI and that has 10,000% upside potential, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum capitalized on consumer anxieties around artificial dyes or other ingredients associated with ultraprocessed foods. While the FDA has voluntarily requested companies phase out artificial dyes by the end of next year, several states — most notably Texas, California and West Virginia — have gone further with outright bans or labeling restrictions on foods containing certain ingredients.

Changes all round Osborne’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment as OpenAI faces mounting challenges while pursuing aggressive global expansion.","The revolving doors at OpenAI are spinning once more as there is another recruitment change.

Former UK Chancellor George Osborne has officially joined OpenAI to spearhead the company’s global expansion efforts. The 54-year-old retired Conservative politician will become managing director of the firm’s ambitious “OpenAI for Countries” initiative, marking a dramatic career pivot that signals how AI is reshaping global politics and economics.

Osborne will assume his new London-based role next month, a BBC report confirms. The appointment comes as OpenAI aggressively pursues international partnerships, with the program designed to help governments build AI infrastructure and integrate AI into public services.

Major tech companies have been investing heavily in UK AI development, with Microsoft announcing a $30 billion infrastructure commitment and an additional $1 billion from companies like Nvidia and Google.

A ‘hire’ purpose

OpenAI’s decision to recruit Osborne represents a calculated move to bridge Silicon Valley innovation with European regulatory frameworks. The former Chancellor, who controlled the UK’s treasury from 2010 to 2016, brings unprecedented government experience to a company valued at approximately $750 billion.

Osborne expressed enthusiasm about joining what he described as “the most exciting and promising company in the world right now,” following conversations with CEO Sam Altman and COO Brad Lightcap, sources close to the matter indicate. The OpenAI for Countries initiative extends the company’s $500 billion “Stargate” data center project beyond American borders, with existing partnerships already established in Argentina, Australia, Germany, and South Korea.

Osborne will be very busy. Fintech firm Coinbase has just appointed him to chair its internal Global Advisory Council. Osborne, who originally joined Coinbase as an advisor in January 2024, will now lead the company’s global strategy and influence international policymakers.

On his X account, Osborne states he is also co-host of the Political Currency podcast, Chair of British Museum, and president of Northern Powerhouse Partnership. That said, he is stepping away from his investment banking position at Evercore.

Global AI politics

This appointment highlights how AI has evolved into critical national infrastructure, with early governance decisions poised to influence global economics and geopolitics for decades. OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane emphasized that the hire reflects “a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure,” with timing crucial for shaping how technology develops worldwide, Monday’s company statements reveal.

Osborne joins a growing trend of British political figures transitioning to major tech companies. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently accepted advisory roles with OpenAI rival Anthropic and Microsoft in October, while Nick Clegg concluded his seven-year tenure with Meta’s global affairs team earlier this year.

Changes all round

Osborne’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment as OpenAI faces mounting challenges while pursuing aggressive global expansion. The company is currently defending multiple lawsuits from families whose children died by suicide after interacting with ChatGPT, including the family of 16-year-old Adam Raine who killed himself in April.

While Osborne arrives, others have left.

Hannah Wong, the executive who steered OpenAI through its most chaotic period, has announced she’s leaving the company.

Wong’s exit continues a troubling pattern that has plagued OpenAI throughout 2025.

Four months ago, co-founder John Schulman joined rival Anthropic while another co-founder Greg Brockman took a sabbatical. Then in September, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati and two other research leaders announced departures, creating a significant brain drain from the company’s leadership ranks.

Tom Cunningham, an economics researcher, also left in September after growing frustrated with limits around publishing certain kinds of work.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2025/12/George-Osborne.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:05:40.941091

The lawsuit, originally filed by the Federal Trade Commission, targets the company’s Uber One service. While Uber markets the subscription as a way for users to save money on rides and food deliveries, prosecutors argue the program relies on ""dark patterns"" and unfair billing practices to pad the company's bottom line.

“When a consumer signs up for a subscription service, they expect to get the savings that are advertised and to be able to try it out without being unlawfully charged,” Nessel said in a statement Thursday. “They shouldn’t have to jump through hoops just to cancel a service they no longer want.”

Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges several violations of consumer trust:

Uber allegedly used ""negative option marketing,"" a practice where customers are automatically charged when a free trial ends without explicit secondary consent.

The suit claims Uber exaggerated how much money subscribers would save by joining Uber One.

Prosecutors allege Uber charged some customers before their scheduled billing dates, including those still within their trial period.

The lawsuit calls the process of canceling Uber One as intentionally difficult, designed to frustrate users into maintaining paid memberships.

Nessel is seeking restitution for Michigan residents, along with civil penalties and a permanent injunction, alleging violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act and the federal Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act.

Michigan is joined in the coalition by 19 other states, including Ohio, Illinois and New York, as well as the District of Columbia and local prosecutors in California.

A trial is not expected to begin until February 2027. In the meantime, Michigan residents who believe they have been unfairly charged by subscription services can file a complaint through the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Team.

AI’s next frontier isn’t merely smarter chat-based assistants, it’s autonomous agents that reason, plan, and execute across entire systems. But to accomplish this, enterprise developers need to move from prototypes to production-ready AI agents that scale securely. This challenge grows as enterprise problems become more complex, requiring architectures where multiple specialized agents collaborate to accomplish sophisticated tasks.

Building AI agents in development differs fundamentally from deploying them at scale. Developers face a chasm between prototype and production, struggling with performance optimization, resource scaling, security implementation, and operational monitoring. Typical approaches leave teams juggling multiple disconnected tools and frameworks, making it difficult to maintain consistency from development through deployment with optimal performance. That’s where the powerful combination of Strands Agents, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, and NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit shine. You can use these tools together to design sophisticated multi-agent systems, orchestrate them, and scale them securely in production with built-in observability, agent evaluation, profiling, and performance optimization. This post demonstrates how to use this integrated solution to build, evaluate, optimize, and deploy AI agents on Amazon Web Services (AWS) from initial development through production deployment.

Foundation for enterprise-ready agents

The open source Strands Agents framework simplifies AI agent development through its model-driven approach. Developers create agents using three components:

Foundation models (FMs) such as Amazon Nova, Claude by Anthropic, and Meta’s Llama

Tools (over 20 built-in, plus custom tools using Python decorators)

Prompts that guide agent behavior.

The framework includes built-in integrations with AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), local testing support, continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) workflows, multiple deployment options, and OpenTelemetry observability.

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is an agentic platform for building, deploying, and operating effective agents securely at scale. It has composable, fully managed services:

Runtime for secure, serverless agent deployment

Memory for short-term and long-term context retention

Gateway for secure tool access by transforming APIs and AWS Lambda functions into agent-compatible tools and connecting to existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

Identity for secure agent identity and access management

Code Interpreter for secure code execution in sandbox environments

Browser for fast, secure web interactions

Observability for comprehensive operational insights to trace, debug, and monitor agent performance

Evaluations for continuously inspecting agent quality based on real-world behavior

Policy to keep agents within defined boundaries

These services, designed to work independently or together, abstract the complexity of building, deploying, and operating sophisticated agents while working with open source frameworks or models delivering enterprise-grade security and reliability.

Agent evaluation, profiling, and optimization with NeMo Agent Toolkit

NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit is an open source framework designed to help developers build, profile, and optimize AI agents regardless of their underlying framework. Its framework-agnostic approach means it works seamlessly with Strands Agents, LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, and custom enterprise frameworks. In addition, different frameworks can interoperate when they’re connected in the NeMo Agent Toolkit.

The toolkit’s profiler provides complete agent workflow analysis that tracks token usage, timing, workflow-specific latency, throughput, and run times for individual agents and tools, enabling targeted performance improvements. Built on the toolkit’s evaluation harness, it includes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-specific evaluators (such as answer accuracy, context relevance, response groundedness, and agent trajectory) and supports custom evaluators for specialized use cases, enabling targeted performance optimization. The automated hyperparameter optimizer profiles and systematically discovers optimal settings for parameters such as temperature, top_p, and max_tokens while maximizing accuracy, groundedness, context relevance, and minimizing token usage, latency, and optimizing for other custom metrics as well. This automated approach profiles your complete agent workflows, identified bottlenecks, and uncovers optimal parameter combinations that manual tuning might miss. The toolkit’s intelligent GPU sizing calculator alleviates guesswork by simulating agent latency and concurrency scenarios and predicting precise GPU infrastructure requirements for production deployment.

The toolkit’s observability integration connects with popular monitoring services including Arize Phoenix, Weights & Biases Weave, Langfuse, and OpenTelemetry supported systems, like Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability, creating a continuous feedback loop for ongoing optimization and maintenance.

Real-world implementation

This example demonstrates a knowledge-based agent that retrieves and synthesizes information from web URLs to answer user queries. Built using Strands Agents with integrated NeMo Agent Toolkit, the solution is containerized for quick deployment in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and takes advantage of Bedrock AgentCore services, such as AgentCore Observability. Additionally, developers have the flexibility to integrate with fully managed models in Amazon Bedrock, models hosted in Amazon SageMaker AI, containerized models in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) or other model API endpoints. The overall architecture is designed for a streamlined workflow, moving from agent definition and optimization to containerization and scalable deployment.

The following architecture diagram illustrates an agent built with Strands Agents integrating NeMo Agent Toolkit deployed in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

Agent development and evaluation

Start by defining your agent and workflows in Strands Agents, then wrap it with NeMo Agent Toolkit to configure components such as a large language model (LLM) for inference and tools. Refer to the Strands Agents and NeMo Agent Toolkit integration example in GitHub for a detailed setup guide. After configuring your environment, validate your agent logic by running a single workflow from the command line with an example prompt:

The following is the truncated terminal output:

Instead of executing a single workflow and exiting, to simulate a real-world scenario, you can spin up a long-running API server capable of handling concurrent requests with the serve command:

The following is the truncated terminal output:

The agent is now running locally on port 8080. To interact with the agent, open a new terminal and execute the following cURL command. This will generate output similar to the previous nat run step but the agent runs continuously as a persistent service rather than executing one time and exiting. This simulates the production environment where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore will run the agent as a containerized service:

The following is the truncated terminal output:

Agent profiling and workflow performance monitoring

With the agent running, the next step is to establish a performance baseline. To illustrate the depth of insights available, in this example, we use a self-managed Llama 3.3 70B Instruct NIM on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P4de.24xlarge instance powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs (8xA100 80 GB GPU) running on Amazon EKS. We use the nat eval command to evaluate the agent and generate the analysis:

nat eval --config_file examples/frameworks/strands_demo/configs/eval_config.yml

The following is the truncated terminal output:

The command generates detailed artifacts that include JSON files per evaluation metric (such as accuracy, groundedness, relevance, and Trajectory accuracy) showing scores from 0–1, reasoning traces, retrieved contexts, and aggregated averages. Additional information in the artifacts generated include workflow outputs, standardized tables, profile traces, and compact summaries for latency and token efficiency. This multi-metric sweep provides a holistic view of agent quality and behavior. The evaluation highlights that while the agent achieved consistent groundedness scores—meaning answers were reliably supported by sources—there is still an opportunity to improve retrieval relevance. The profile trace output contains workflow-specific latency, throughput, and runtime at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals. The command generates a Gantt chart of the agent flow and nested stack analysis to pinpoint exactly where bottlenecks exist, as seen in the following figure. It also reports concurrency spikes and token efficiency so you can understand precisely how scaling impacts prompt and completion usage.

During the profiling, nat spawns eight concurrent agent workflows (shown in orange bars in the chart), which is the default concurrency configuration during evaluation. The p90 latency for the workflow shown is approximately 58.9 seconds. Crucially, the data confirmed that response generation was the primary bottleneck, with the longest LLM segments taking roughly 61.4 seconds. Meanwhile, non-LLM overhead remained minimal. HTTP requests averaged only 0.7–1.2 seconds, and knowledge base access was negligible. Using this level of granularity, you can now identify and optimize specific bottlenecks in the agent workflows.

Agent performance optimization

After profiling, refine the agent’s parameters to balance quality, performance, and cost. Manual tuning of LLM settings like temperature and top_p is often a game of guesswork. The NeMo Agent Toolkit turns this into a data-driven science. You can use the built-in optimizer to perform a systematic sweep across your parameter search space:

nat optimize --config_file examples/frameworks/strands_demo/configs/optimizer_config.yml

The following is the truncated terminal output:

This command launches an automated sweep across key LLM parameters, such as temperature, top_p, and max_tokens, as defined in the config (in this case optimizer_config.yml) search space. The optimizer runs 20 trials with three repetitions each, using weighted evaluation metrics to automatically discover optimal model settings. It might take up to 15–20 minutes for the optimizer to run 20 trials.

The toolkit evaluates each parameter set against a weighted multi-objective score, aiming to maximize quality (for example, accuracy, groundedness, or tool use) while minimizing token cost and latency. Upon completion, it generates detailed performance artifacts and summary tables so you can quickly identify and select the optimal configuration for production. The following is the hyperparameter optimizer configuration:

In this example, NeMo Agent Toolkit Optimize systematically evaluated parameter configurations and identified temperature ≈ 0.7, top_p ≈ 1.0, and max_tokens ≈ 6k (6144) as optimal configuration yielding the highest accuracy across 20 trials. This configuration delivered a 35% accuracy improvement over baseline while simultaneously achieving 20% token efficiency gains compared to the 8192 max_tokens setting—maximizing both performance and cost efficiency for these production deployments.

The optimizer plots pairwise pareto curves, as shown in the following pairwise matrix comparison charts, to analyze trade-offs between different parameters. The parallel coordinates plot, that follows the matrix comparison chart, shows optimal trials (red lines) achieving high quality scores (0.8–1.0) across accuracy, groundedness, and relevance while trading off some efficiency as token usage and latency drop to 0.6–0.8 on the normalized scale. The pairwise matrix confirms strong correlations between quality metrics and reveals actual token consumption clustered tightly around 2,500–3,100 tokens across all trials. These results indicate that further gains in accuracy and token efficiency might be possible through prompt engineering. This is something that development teams can achieve using NeMo Agent Toolkit’s prompt optimization capabilities, helping reduce costs while maximizing performance.

The following image shows the pairwise matrix comparison:

The following image shows the parallel coordinates plot:

Right-sizing production GPU infrastructure

After your agent is optimized and you’ve finalized the runtime or inference configuration, you can shift your focus to assessing your model deployment infrastructure. If you’re self-managing your model deployment on a fleet of EC2 GPU-powered instances, then one of the most difficult aspects of moving agents to production is predicting exactly what compute resources are necessary to support a target use case and concurrent users without overrunning the budget or causing timeouts. The NeMo Agent Toolkit GPU sizing calculator addresses this challenge by using your agent’s actual performance profile to determine the optimal cluster size for specific service level objectives (SLOs), enabling right-sizing that alleviates the trade-off between performance and cost. To generate a sizing profile, you run the sizing calculator across a range of concurrency levels (for example, 1–32 simultaneous users):

Executing this on our reference EC2 P4de.24xlarge instance powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs running on Amazon EKS for a Llama 3.3 70B Instruct NIM produced the following capacity analysis:

As shown in the following chart, calculated concurrency scales almost linearly with both latency and end‑to‑end runtime, with P95 LLM latency and workflow runtime demonstrating near-perfect trend fits (R² ≈ 0.977/0.983). Each additional concurrent request introduces a predictable latency penalty, suggesting the system operates within a linear capacity zone where throughput can be optimized by adjusting latency tolerance.

With the sizing metrics captured, you can estimate the GPU cluster size for a specific concurrency and latency. For example, to support 25 concurrent users with a target workflow runtime of 50 seconds, you can run the calculator:

This workflow analyzes current performance metrics and generates a resource recommendation. In our example scenario, the tool calculates that to meet strict latency requirements for 25 simultaneous users, approximately 30 GPUs are required based on the following formula:

The following is the output from the sizing estimation:

Production agent deployment to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

After evaluating, profiling, and optimizing your agent, deploy it to production. Although running the agent locally is sufficient for testing, enterprise deployment requires an agent runtime that helps provide security, scalability, and robust memory management without the overhead of managing infrastructure. This is where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime shines—providing enterprise-grade serverless agent runtime without the infrastructure overhead. Refer to the step-by-step deployment guide in the NeMo Agent Toolkit Repository. By packaging your optimized agent in a container and deploying it to the serverless Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you elevate your prototype agent to a resilient application for long-running tasks and concurrent user requests. After you deploy the agent, visibility becomes critical. This integration creates a unified observability experience, transforming opaque black-box execution into deep visibility. You gain exact traces, spans, and latency breakdowns for every interaction in production, integrated into Bedrock AgentCore Observability using OpenTelemetry.

The following screenshot shows the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard displaying Amazon Bedrock AgentCore traces and spans, visualizing the execution path and latency of the deployed Strands agent.

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore services extend well beyond agent runtime management and observability. Your deployed agents can seamlessly use additional Bedrock AgentCore services, including Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity for authentication and authorization, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway for tools access, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory for context-awareness, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter for secure code execution, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser for web interactions, to create enterprise-ready agents.

Conclusion

Production AI agents need performance visibility, optimization, and reliable infrastructure. For the example use case, this integration delivered on all three fronts: achieving 20% token efficiency gains, 35% accuracy improvements for the example use case, and performance-tuned GPU infrastructure calibrated for target concurrency. By combining Strands Agents for foundational agent development and orchestration, the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit for deep agent profiling, optimization, and right-sizing production GPU infrastructure, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for secure, scalable agent infrastructure, developers can have an end-to-end solution that helps provide predictable outcomes. You can now build, evaluate, optimize, and deploy agents at scale on AWS with this integrated solution.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LEVI. Levi Strauss & Co.'s share was trading at $22.55 as of December 16th. LEVI’s trailing and forward P/E were 16.75 and 15.17 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) is emerging as a prime beneficiary of a structural shift back toward premium denim, supported by compelling consumer search data that suggests demand is durable rather than fashion-cycle driven. As the world’s largest branded apparel company and a global leader in jeanswear, Levi’s operates across more than 110 countries and generates roughly $6.2 billion in annual revenue through wholesale, direct-to-consumer, and e-commerce channels.

Alternative data indicates that consumer interest in denim has rebounded meaningfully, with Google searches for Levi’s jeans up 59% year over year, overall Levi’s brand searches up 52%, and category-level denim searches up 25%, all reaching five-year highs. This momentum has accelerated throughout 2025 and reflects converging tailwinds such as return-to-office trends, Y2K-inspired styles, and a preference for versatile, utility-oriented apparel that aligns with Levi’s heritage positioning.

High-intent e-commerce indicators reinforce this signal, with Amazon searches for Levi’s up 47% year over year and Google Shopping searches surging 94%, suggesting elevated conversion intent rather than casual browsing. Importantly, these search trends correlate strongly with operational performance. Levi’s Q3 2025 results exceeded expectations, with revenue of $1.54 billion growing 7% year over year, gross margins expanding to 61.7%, and EPS of $0.34 beating consensus. The company has now delivered 12 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, while direct-to-consumer sales rose 11% and e-commerce grew 16%, highlighting successful digital execution.

Strategically, Levi’s premium positioning and culturally resonant marketing, exemplified by its “REIIMAGINE” campaign with Beyoncé, have translated into tangible results, including 12% growth in women’s denim. Management’s decision to raise full-year guidance underscores confidence in sustained momentum. Overall, the breadth and intensity of consumer search growth provide a buffer against execution risks and support a probability-weighted outlook of continued outperformance into mid-2026.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on V.F. Corporation (VFC) by Fun-Imagination-2488 in April 2025, which highlighted the turnaround under new leadership, brand revitalization efforts, margin recovery, and debt reduction. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 62.84% since our coverage. This is because the turnaround execution gained investor confidence. The thesis still stands as operational discipline continues. Paradox Intelligence shares a similar thesis but emphasizes alternative data and demand-led momentum.

See our latest analysis for Kraft Heinz.

The leadership reboot and breakup story is landing against a tougher backdrop, with a year to date share price return of negative 19.6 percent and a five year total shareholder return of negative 10.3 percent. However, the recent one week lift hints that investors are starting to price in at least some turnaround potential.

If this shake up has you rethinking your defensive staples, it could be worth scanning healthcare stocks to see which names the market is rewarding for steady growth and resilience right now.

With the stock still trading well below many estimates of intrinsic value despite years of sluggish returns, the next question is simple: is this a genuine reset for Kraft Heinz, or are markets already baking in the growth ahead?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 8.6% Undervalued

With Kraft Heinz last closing at $24.75 against a narrative fair value near $27, the story hinges on a slow but material profitability rebuild.

Ongoing portfolio optimization, divesting non core brands, and reinvesting into high margin segments and key power brands should lead to structurally higher operating margins and improved profitability in future periods.

The potential deal would value OpenAI at over $500 billion; however, sources caution that negotiations remain fluid and terms could still change significantly.

The talks come as OpenAI prepares for a potential initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion. This investment would add Amazon to a growing list of major technology companies betting heavily on OpenAI’s capabilities, following substantial deals with Nvidia and Oracle earlier this year. Amazon’s potential investment is more than just a capital injection, it could reshape the competitive landscape of enterprise AI solutions and challenge long-standing partners like Microsoft.

Investment Details Point to Strategic Computing Partnership

As part of the deal, OpenAI is reportedly planning to use Amazon’s Trainium chips. These specialized chips compete directly with offerings from Nvidia and Google in the AI computing market, suggesting the partnership goes beyond financial investment into deeper technical collaboration.

Amazon’s financing could serve as an anchor for a broader fundraising round involving additional investors. This approach would allow OpenAI to secure significant capital while diversifying its investor base beyond its primary backer, Microsoft.

Beyond the investment itself, discussions reportedly include OpenAI selling an enterprise version of ChatGPT to Amazon. This commercial component would give Amazon access to OpenAI’s conversational AI technology for integration into its business services. However, the scope of integration rights remains unclear, particularly whether Amazon could incorporate ChatGPT features into consumer-facing applications such as shopping tools.

Developing advanced AI systems requires massive computing power, creating opportunities for cloud providers like Amazon to monetize their infrastructure. This investment would position Amazon to benefit both as an investor in OpenAI and as a provider of the computational backbone powering its AI models.

Amazon’s Move Challenges Microsoft’s OpenAI Exclusivity

Amazon’s possible investment marks a major shift in OpenAI’s corporate relationships, particularly with Microsoft. Microsoft currently holds a 27% stake in OpenAI and has exclusive rights to sell OpenAI models to its cloud customers.

This arrangement has allowed Microsoft to power AI products such as Copilot with OpenAI’s technology, giving the company a significant competitive edge in the enterprise AI market. It enabled Microsoft to deploy OpenAI’s models immediately while building its own internal AI capabilities.

However, since OpenAI restructured away from its nonprofit origins in October, it has been free to pursue broader partnerships with other firms.

An Amazon investment would give the company direct access to the technology underpinning Microsoft’s recent AI product launches, potentially leveling the competitive field. It could also allow Amazon to receive future OpenAI developments that the company releases alongside Microsoft.

Implications for Microsoft’s AI Product Strategy

The potential Amazon-OpenAI partnership raises important questions about Microsoft’s standing in the AI landscape. While Microsoft retains its equity stake and exclusive cloud sales rights, Amazon’s involvement could influence which new OpenAI capabilities remain exclusive to the Microsoft ecosystem.

As OpenAI develops next-generation AI technologies, it may now have greater flexibility in distributing those innovations across different partners.

Microsoft’s AI products – especially Copilot – have relied heavily on early access to OpenAI’s models and features, although the company has made recent pivots to reduce this dependency. Even if existing agreements safeguard current integrations, future developments from OpenAI might no longer default to Microsoft.

Amazon’s significant investment could include provisions for parallel or early access to emerging technologies, potentially weakening Microsoft’s advantage.

The competitive dynamics go beyond access to AI models. As Amazon integrates OpenAI technology into its cloud services, it could create AI-powered business tools that directly challenge Microsoft’s offerings.

With AWS’s market reach combined with OpenAI’s capabilities, the partnership could deliver compelling alternatives to Microsoft’s AI cloud suite, particularly for enterprises already invested in Amazon’s cloud ecosystem.",http://www.uctoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMAGE-FORMAT-UC-TODAY-2025-12-18T112657.639.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:03:24.488627

The Federal Trade Commission, a consumer protection agency, is looking into the grocery delivery giant's use of AI pricing tools after an investigation found it was charging customers substantially different prices for the same items, according to a Reuters report Wednesday.

An investigation by Consumer Reports, Groundwork Collaborative, and More Perfect Union published earlier this month found prices for about three-quarters of surveyed items on Instacart varied by up to 23% from user to user among volunteers shopping at the same time. The report estimated such price variations could add up to about $1,200 per year in additional costs for the typical household shopping on Instacart. A review of an Investopedia editor's transactions on Instacart found that prices for a range of products at Costco (COST) also varied from one order to the next.

""Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,"" a company spokesperson told Investopedia. ""First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing—prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores,” the spokesperson said.

The FTC said in an emailed statement Thursday that it has a ""longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations. But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart’s alleged pricing practices.""

The FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand over its Eversight pricing tool, named for a company that Instacart acquired in 2022, Reuters reported. The tool helps retailers test consumer reactions to different prices, and retailers who use the tool could see a 1% to 3% bump in revenue, according to Instacart's website.

Early this year, the FTC said that ""surveillance pricing,"" which Instacart says it does not use, has become more popular among online retailers. With surveillance pricing, companies could use data about a shopper such as their location, browsing history, and even the movements of a computer mouse to guess how much they might be willing to spend and influence displayed prices.

Shares of Instacart parent Maplebear (CART) were down about 1% in recent trading. They've lost about 9% of their value since the start of the year.

Key Takeaways:

Laura Burdese steps into the CEO role after serving as deputy since 2023.

Jean-Christophe Babin stays on as chairman, head of Bulgari Hotels, and president of the Bulgari Foundation.

The move signals LVMH’s strategic continuity while deepening operational leadership across jewelry and hospitality.

Bulgari will usher in a new era of leadership this July, as Laura Burdese is set to become chief executive officer of the storied Roman jeweler. Her promotion follows a one-year stint as deputy CEO and more than two decades of executive experience across beauty, watches, and luxury retail.

The transition comes as Jean-Christophe Babin, who has led Bulgari since 2013, pivots to focus on key growth verticals within the maison, including its expanding hotel division and philanthropic foundation. He will remain chairman of the Bulgari board, CEO of Bulgari Hotels, and president of the Bulgari Foundation, continuing to report to Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH Watches & Jewelry.

Burdese, also reporting to Bianchi, has been instrumental in Bulgari’s recent marketing evolution and helped oversee the development of its new high-tech jewelry manufacturing site in Valenza, inaugurated this spring. That facility—now the largest of its kind dedicated to a single brand—includes Scuola Bulgari, a new public training school aimed at fostering craftsmanship talent within Italy.

The leadership shift reflects a carefully choreographed handover between two seasoned executives who have worked closely to elevate Bulgari’s profile through both product innovation and branded experiences. Burdese’s ascent also reinforces LVMH’s focus on internal succession and cross-sector leadership development. She previously led Acqua di Parma and held senior roles at Swatch Group and L’Oréal.

During his tenure, Babin was pivotal in advancing Bulgari’s watchmaking credentials—most recently celebrated with the Octo Finissimo Ultra COSC, the world’s thinnest mechanical timepiece. His leadership also extended to hospitality, with Bulgari Hotels now present in Rome, Paris, Tokyo, and beyond, with further openings slated for Miami and Los Angeles.

As Burdese steps into the top job, the maison is positioned to continue its strategic expansion across jewelry, watches, hospitality, and cultural programming, supported by a legacy of Italian craftsmanship and a sharpened global vision.",https://theimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bulgari-Appoints-Laura-Burdese-as-CEO-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:02:56.458535

In the US, Vantage began the data centre ABS market for what the Securities and Exchange Commission deems qualified institutional buyers in 2018.
As part of data centre financing, lenders must account for refinancing risk, which is intertwined with the risk that data centre tenants will not renew their contracts.
Europe does at least have the example of the US market to follow, where there is a thriving data centre ABS market.
“The need for data centre financing is a very good test [for Europe’s capital markets],” says Florence Coeroli, UK and global head of engineering at Société Générale.","Since the influential Draghi report on European Union competitiveness was published in September 2024, politicians have embarked upon a series of reforms to shake the bloc out of stagnation.

Many of the reforms identified by Mario Draghi, former ECB president and Italian prime minister, aim to boost GDP growth. Key among them are measures to invigorate capital markets into a so-called Savings and Investment Union, which includes a plan to revitalise securitization.

Securitization’s advocates have largely welcomed the proposals, but so far nothing has been put into practice as parliamentarians deliberate what the European Commission has recommended.

Whether the EU can step up to meet the extraordinary demand for data centres — Morgan Stanley estimates there is a $1.5tr financing gap worldwide for data centres up to 2028 — will provide a big test for this vision of its competitiveness.

Rising to the data centre challenge plays into each of three areas for action Draghi highlights in his report: “closing the innovation gap with the US and China, especially in advanced technologies”; “decarbonisation and competitiveness”; and “increasing security and reducing dependencies”.

The importance of data centres to the first objective is clear, while their huge energy demand makes them an important consideration in the second. The final area plays into the increasingly popular idea of data sovereignty and having control over key infrastructure by locating it domestically.

“One of the things we’ve often seen is a lot of the growth in Europe being driven by countries wanting their own digital infrastructure,” said Latham & Watkins partner Jeremiah Wagner at a GlobalCapital event in London in October. “That’s a big movement and I think that’s driven on a geopolitical basis.”

As an example, in October Italy recognised data centre developer Vantage as carrying out nationally strategic infrastructure investments that support the country’s economic agenda, one of only four companies to achieve the designation. It allows Vantage to gain expedited permission for its developments, but such designations are only part of the picture.

EU data centre developers still need access to affordable financing. In that respect, the bloc is coming from a standing start in each of the three phases of financing needed to develop a data centre.

First is the purchase of the site and gaining permission to build. Then comes the development and construction. Finally, there is the financing backed by the income the data centre generates.

“Where the meat of the financing is done is in that construction phase, because the meat of the [capital expenditure] is in that two-year span… from spade in the ground to when the data centre is complete and operating,” Barclays managing director Gordon Beck said at the same GlobalCapital event.

The project finance market is crucial during the construction phase, when data centre developers raise non-recourse debt from banks and/or institutional investors to pay for the building work.

Projects then typically operate for an initial period, after which the project finance debt is refinanced, often through the securitization or private placement markets.

“In a simplified picture, you need both bank debt and capital markets financing,” says Heiko Ludwig, global head of structured finance at Nord LB. “You need bank debt in the early part because it’s more flexible. Ideally, you’d then put it into the long-term arms of asset managers, pension funds and others… In my opinion, it should not be assumed that there is an endless future supply of very long-term bank debt, like 20 years and longer.”

Before even coming to that, however, developers need to obtain a site to build on. “When you’re speculatively purchasing land with the intent of acquiring power and permits, that’s probably best suited to something in the private credit world or a relatively structured facility and, frankly, a relatively higher risk facility versus the kind of cash flow debt financing that comes later in the piece,” said Beck at the GlobalCapital event.

Even some early construction work can require equity, or other more speculative capital, to line up tenancy contracts and close a project financing.

“For data centre developers, raising finance is a bit chicken and egg,” says Oliver Bradley, global head of digital infrastructure at Macquarie Capital. “Potential tenants want to know how much capacity you have in the next three to six months, which means that developers have to have begun construction, which requires a significant capital commitment.

“To get the tenancy contracts, you need to have financed and partially built your data centre, but to raise debt, you need to have the contracts.”

Given the country’s dominance in AI and data centre investment, the US is by far the largest project finance market for the sector.

“As of Q3 [2025], there is an estimated $70bn-$80bn of non-recourse debt raised to finance data centres in the US,” says Syed Usman Ahmed, head of digital infrastructure at Apterra Infrastructure Capital. “Four years ago the market was around $5bn. By year end, we expect at least $100bn of deals will have closed.”

Much of this non-recourse debt has been provided by banks. For example, two bank-funded US deals that closed in the latter half of this year are the $925m financing for Rowan Digital Infrastructure’s Bauxite hyperscale campus and Lambda’s $275m financing to enlarge its AI data centre portfolio.

The Rowan deal was led by SMBC, MUFG, Mizuho and Société Générale, while the Lambda deal was led and arranged by JP Morgan and syndicated to a wider lender group.

Vantage has also been in the market with a $38bn US data centre financing, which sources have confirmed is likely to be the largest ever project financing for any asset class.

Project finance remains a bank-led market, but institutional investors are increasingly backing greenfield data centre financings. In October, Blue Owl Capital issued $27.3bn of notes through Beignet Investor LLC, a project finance-style holding company, to invest in an 80% interest in a US data centre joint venture with Meta.

Europe is trailing the US in the development and financing of data centres, although transactions such as Bulk Infrastructure’s €410m financing for its N01 Data Center Campus in Norway have closed this year.

“If you look at the data centre capacity due to come online in the next year, it would be about three times larger in the US versus Europe,” says Jonathan Tweed, head of TMT finance at Société Générale in London. “Europe is lagging behind the US, with project financing volumes remaining similar between 2024 and 2025.”

Both land and power are more expensive in many European markets — each factor critical to data centre development — and Europe’s capital markets are less liquid. A GlobalCapital source notes that about €7bn of data centre project finance deals have closed in Europe this year, as of early November.

“I think that the hyperscale players have been focusing their attention on the US so far,” says Tweed. “The European data centre pipeline is, however, expected to grow rapidly next year with Sovereign AI and larger projects being announced throughout Europe in multiple locations.”

Liquid capital markets are essential to financing data centres, as most banks expect the construction debt they provide to be refinanced.

Securitization is widely seen as offering the most competitive balance between pricing and flexibility, but the gap between Europe and the US is even more stark when comparing the depth of their respective markets in the asset class. At the time GlobalCapital went to press, there had only ever been two data centre securitizations in Europe.

In the US, Vantage began the data centre ABS market for what the Securities and Exchange Commission deems qualified institutional buyers in 2018. QTS started a similar market in data centre CMBS in 2021.

In the time since those deals, the US CMBS market has swallowed about $20bn of paper, while the US ABS market has supported another $43bn, not including trades done in the 4(a)(2) private placement market.

In November, QTS tapped the CMBS market with a $3.46bn deal to refinance its 2021 trade of $3.2bn, likely the biggest CMBS deal of any type all year.

Data centre project financings usually run for five years and are ‘hard mini-perms’, which in project finance jargon means they require refinancing at or before maturity. Failure to refinance is treated as an event of default.

In addition, many banks have reduced their long-term infrastructure lending in the wake of reforms to bank capital requirements under Basel III.

As part of data centre financing, lenders must account for refinancing risk, which is intertwined with the risk that data centre tenants will not renew their contracts.

“The tenors of most project financings for data centres are shorter than the tenancy contracts,” says James Richards, an executive director in project finance at Standard Chartered. “The banks take refinancing risk, which is related to renewal risk for the tenancy contracts.”

Debt servicing depends on rental payments to data centres from their tenants. “When banks size the debt, they evaluate how much will be amortised at maturity and whether the contracts can be easily renewed or replaced,” says Richards.

“The amount of refinancing risk is partially determined by the level of renewal risk and the attractiveness of the site for alternative tenants, as new lenders will want to see long-term contracts in place.”

Several tenancy extensions are often required for full project debt amortisation, taking place in tandem with at least one refinancing.

Other crucial considerations for lenders are construction risk and tenant creditworthiness. Construction risk is sometimes mitigated by the developer making completion guarantees.

Lenders will also carefully evaluate tenants’ credit ratings and business models — a simpler process for hyperscalers such as Microsoft than for a newer company like, for example, CoreWeave.

Risks aside, there is immense appetite from project finance lenders to fund data centres, as the project pipeline is brimming and pricing on construction loans sits in the low-200bp to low-400bp range, according to market sources.

Top tier data centre ABS issuers in the US have priced deals with spreads on the senior notes of 140bp-160bp. In October, Compass, a dominant player in US data centre securitizations, priced a $326m single tranche, triple-A rated ABS at 125bp, yielding less than 5%.

The bottom line for many is that if the EU is going to get close to finding enough financing for data centres in terms of both scale and duration, securitization is going to have to step up. S&P expects annual data centre financing needs to rise to $173bn by 2028.

“At the moment, the bank market is working very well for sponsors, but if you add up all the numbers for future needs for new and existing infrastructure, you come to a total volume that most likely could not be financed in the traditional way with the existing bank capital in Europe,” says Nord LB’s Ludwig.

Europe does at least have the example of the US market to follow, where there is a thriving data centre ABS market.

Senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners, Matt Bissonette, a banker who has been involved in digital infrastructure financing for more than a decade, expects a record year for data centre securitization issuance in 2026. “It’s hard to put an exact number on it… but I could see a path towards $30bn across data centre securitization markets for stabilised assets alone,” he says.

“We’re seeing new investors participate, people focusing on bringing more capital into the digital infrastructure space, and I think that trend is only going to continue.”

Andrew Butville, director of ABS at MetLife Investment Management, believes the $13.8bn of US data centre ABS to have been priced by mid-November in 2025 could double in 2026.

“That’s based on the construction pipeline of data centres and project finance and bank finance that’s flowed into the sector,” he says.

There is plenty of evidence that investors will flock to the market to lap it up. If they cannot find paper at home, Bissonette expects more European investors to head to the US. “They’ve been limited because of regulation, but there is certainly demand from folks there,” he says.

“There is a very, very strong relative value in the securitized market versus the corporate market, especially for the highest quality assets and issuers. If you’re buying corporate bonds, you can see a pretty big pick-up versus the underlying hyperscalers.”

The relative value judgement will vary from buyer to buyer, however, and when they get into the market.

“We still like the space from a credit perspective, but spreads have really tightened to the point where we don’t see a lot of value in particular shelves,” says Butville. “We’ve sold some of our exposure because it’s just so much tighter than where we bought it.”

The question is whether Europe’s securitization market will be able to follow the US example.

“The need for data centre financing is a very good test [for Europe’s capital markets],” says Florence Coeroli, UK and global head of engineering at Société Générale. “You need issuers that are willing to go for it and test the market. For investors to put in the work to understand the asset class, they need to know there will be more transactions.”

Despite the scale of the challenge, European market sources are bullish. Matt Dunn, partner at Clifford Chance, says “the European ABS market for data centres is poised for significant growth” and could “become one of the cornerstones of digital infrastructure financing in Europe, mirroring the established success seen in the US”.

“We expect the data centre sector to grow,” agrees Kate Galustian, head of European ABS at BlackRock. “It’s early days, but it’s an exciting space. We want a broad investable universe.

“In an area like this, we would be extremely selective given the lack of historical data… In principle, the story is strong, but there are number of tech and operational factors to consider, as well the nascency of the market.”

That caution speaks to both the opportunity and the challenge for sponsors issuing European data centre securitizations. Sponsors want to deepen their access to capital, but the asset class is quite different to typical European securitization deals.

“There are US investors looking at the European market, but issuers that already do ABS in the US want to come to Europe to attract new investors,” says Coeroli. “They want the financing to be additive and not drawing liquidity away from the US market.

“At the same time, it’s good to have those US investors because it gives you certainty when you come to issue,” she says, considering they may already have good knowledge of and appetite for the asset class. “And these US-based investors may deploy specific euro liquidity pockets for the European deals.”

One of the most important questions for those involved with data centre securitizations is how to structure the deals to best tap into the different pools of liquidity. The best-case scenario is a structure that can bring in both ABS investors and those who like data centres as an asset but are less familiar with securitization.

“Data centres potentially bring new types of investors into the market, away from just traditional securitization investors, but it’s very early to try and quantify the depth of the market given there’s only been a couple of deals in Europe,” says Galustian.

Looking at those two deals is somewhat instructive, however. Both used a structure more similar to a US data centre ABS than a typical European ABS or CMBS, only issuing fixed rate notes. Such bonds are unusual in Europe’s securitization market.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see more structural features coming into future deals targeting European investors,” says Henrik Nilsson, executive director at Natixis. “The European investor base would like to buy floating rate notes for example, but you need to work out how to do the hedging.”

The challenge with hedging is the long-dated nature of the assets. Data centre securitizations typically have strong incentives to call the deal at the anticipated repayment date (ARD) in the form of accelerated amortisation and step-up coupons. However, the ARD is normally five years away, but, if missed, the legal final maturity can be decades away, potentially making hedging very expensive.

Another big question is whether to mortgage the data centre and put that mortgage into a CMBS structure or securitize the cashflows from the lease directly in an ABS. Both are used in the US, but Vantage used ABS for both European deals.

“Sponsors are looking at a combination of US private placements and potentially an ABS into European markets,” says Nilsson. “The two deals from Vantage have really put [the ABS option] on the map and there’s definitely more to come.

“Sponsors want to diversify their funding sources as much as they can. The ABS route opens up new investors and then there’s the CMBS route as well. Securitization is needed to get the liquidity the market will need.”

A challenge with CMBS in Europe is that the market is far less liquid than in the US. There had been just 11 public deals by mid-November, according to GlobalCapital’s Asset Backed Monitor, and that is considered a bumper year for European CMBS.

“Ideally, we would like to see a bigger European CMBS market, but we are seeing more and more deals and, especially this year, the market has been quite active,” says Nilsson. “That is definitely helpful for data centre deals because there’s an overlap in the investor base.”

The other recurring problem for European securitization issuers is fragmented regulation. Each country has its own tax and insolvency laws, which makes it difficult to combine assets in different countries into one deal.

The challenge applies across asset classes, not just to data centres, and can make it hard for issuers to achieve the scale they need for a securitization.

Data centres, however, may have it better than some other asset classes because the assets are normally big enough to support a standalone securitization.

“The beauty and the difficulty of Europe is the number of different jurisdictions [versus the single, large market in the US],” says Coeroli. “We will need to consider ABS transactions country by country [instead of multi-country issuance], but that allows us to [target] deals that are the right size for the investors in a certain country.”

However, regulatory fragmentation could become a barrier that prevents issuers accessing more efficient funding structures as the market develops.

“In the US, there are master trusts of data centres,” says Nilsson. “In Europe, it’s a bit more tricky to implement because there are multiple jurisdictions. Given the size of the assets here, in most cases, it probably works to do it jurisdiction by jurisdiction. I think a master trust could be done, but there are questions on the legal side and you’d have to get everyone comfortable with the structure.”

Certainly, a solution to the EU’s fragmentation problem is not close at hand. “It takes time to create a solution that mitigates [the overreliance on bank debt],” says Nord LB’s Ludwig. “There isn’t really one answer… Maybe it takes a European solution of not thinking the unified market is one location but one set of rules. For example, if you have to deal with 16 different sets of insolvency laws, it becomes a very complicated consideration.”

Meanwhile, the US market develops apace. Not only are floating rate tranches under consideration, but there is a debate about extending the tenor of securitizations.

Head of structured products at Conning Asset Management, Michael Nowakowski, says he would not be surprised to see a 10-year ARD on a data centre deal in 2026 given that other types of securtization have done the same and that some of the biggest tenants of data centres — the hyperscalers like Alphabet and Meta — which are the underlying credits for the paper, have issued long-dated corporate bonds.

“We’re already seeing longer ARDs in some other spaces where they’re pushing seven and 10-year... so why not this next?” he says.

However, he urges for the pace to slow in 2026: “I hope the chorus of investors who are flagging a little bit of caution on this dampens some of the untethered growth that’s happening right now in this space.”

Bissonette of Guggenhiem Partners says it feels like the “early innings” in the development of digital infrastructure. “We have incredible demand from investors and clients that are bringing new sites online who want to access the structured markets.

“We’re trying to solve for a significant portion of a $1tr-plus need over the next five to 10 years.”",https://assets.euromoneydigital.com/dims4/default/b2fa504/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5120x2688+0+96/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Feuromoney-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe7%2F23%2F85c8a20d4c7b8fbce5febe4706cc%2F2d5mwrd.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:03:28.136601

Maplebear shares are experiencing downward pressure. Why is CART stock trading lower?

What To Know: Reuters reported Thursday that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has sent Maplebear, which operates Instacart, a civil investigative demand related to its AI-driven pricing tool known as Eversight.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the FTC is seeking information about how the Eversight software is used by retailers to test different prices. The tool has drawn criticism following a recent study that found shoppers were shown different prices for the same grocery items on Instacart.

The FTC said it does not comment on potential or ongoing investigations but stated it was ""disturbed"" by reports about Instacart's alleged pricing practices. The agency noted that the opening of a probe does not prove wrongdoing and that not all investigations lead to lawsuits.

Instacart said last week that pricing tests conducted through Eversight are randomized and not based on individual user data or behavior. The company also said it has been working with retailers to encourage price parity between in-store and online pricing.

People who received Lilly’s Zepbound in the head-to-head trial regained 5 kg on orforglipron.
Although patients could switch from Zepbound to orforglipron, Custer said Lilly doesn’t see the oral option cannibalizing injectable sales.","Eli Lilly has shown patients maintained most of their weight loss after switching from injectable GLP-1s to its oral drug candidate, teeing the drugmaker up to target people taking Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy.

Lilly has filed for FDA approval of its oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, orforglipron, using data in patients who received the small molecule as an initial treatment for obesity. But the Big Pharma spotted a chance to piggyback on its head-to-head study of Wegovy and Zepbound to establish orforglipron for maintenance use. Patients who finished the trial were offered the chance to re-randomize to orforglipron or placebo.

After 52 weeks of daily oral dosing, patients who received Wegovy in the head-to-head trial had gained 0.9 kilograms. The patients weighed 113.5 kg before taking Wegovy, 95 kg at the end of the head-to-head trial and 95.9 kg after 52 weeks on orforglipron.

People who received Lilly’s Zepbound in the head-to-head trial regained 5 kg on orforglipron. The figures for that cohort are 115.8 kg at baseline, 90.9 kg after the Zepbound study and 95.9 kg after 52 weeks on orforglipron. All the figures come from per-protocol-like analyses focused on patients who stayed on the assigned treatment. Lilly is yet to share figures for analyses including patients who stopped treatment.

The drugmaker said the most common adverse events on orforglipron were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 4.8% and 7.2%, respectively, for patients who went from Wegovy or Zepbound to orforglipron. Discontinuation rates in the placebo cohorts were 7.6% and 6.3%.

Writing in a note to investors in October, BMO Capital Markets analysts said the readout on orforglipron in the maintenance setting was underappreciated. The analysts said the trial was a “unique opportunity” to win market share from Novo. Lilly could use the data to drive switches from Wegovy to orforglipron, chipping away at sales of its main rival’s flagship product.

Ken Custer, Ph.D., president of cardiometabolic health at Lilly, discussed the opportunity on an earnings call in October. Lilly has very bullish expectations for orforglipron as a first-line starter incretin, Custer said, and sees maintenance use as “an exciting boost” beyond those forecasts. Although patients could switch from Zepbound to orforglipron, Custer said Lilly doesn’t see the oral option cannibalizing injectable sales.

Lilly has a Commissioner's National Priority Voucher that could accelerate FDA approval of orforglipron. Novo’s oral form of Wegovy is in line to beat orforglipron to market. However, Lilly could have a supply edge because production of orforglipron, a small molecule, may be more scalable than manufacture of Novo’s relatively high-dose peptide.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1348209410.jpg?VersionId=ULXrxYF8OKCZEpCYyowVdLQrz2EO2vmh,N,,2025-12-18 10:06:59.121604

Moss Inc also has operations in Spain, Germany, Poland, and the UK. The latter, Moss UK, was previously known as MacroArt before it was acquired by Moss Inc at the end of 2023, with the full rebrand being completed in 2024.

Mark Auth, president and chief executive officer of The Vomela Companies, says: “Moss has built an exceptional reputation for crafted experiential environments. By adding Moss to Vomela, we are bringing together two organisations whose strengths naturally align.

“Moss’s solutions, design, and structural engineering expertise perfectly complements our scale in printing, fabrication, installation, and logistics. Together, we create the most capable experiential and events company in the world, and with Moss’s established operations in the UK and Europe, we gain immediate international reach that expands what we can deliver for customers globally.”

Vomela currently supports a number of global brands and large-scale events including Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the New York City Marathon.

With the acquisition, Vomela hopes to integrate Moss’s engineering expertise, fabrication capabilities, and global footprint to enhance its ability to serve clients.

Jason Popp, president and chief executive officer of Moss Inc, says: “Joining Vomela allows Moss to accelerate our mission of delivering premium, sustainable experiential environments for global brands.

“Vomela’s scale, infrastructure, and operational strength will enable us to serve customers with even greater reach, speed, and consistency. We are excited about the opportunities this partnership creates for our customers and our people.”

The acquisition follows significant financial support from global investment firm, The Riverside Company, which first invested in Vomela in January 2025 to support the company’s continued growth through strategic expansion and acquisitions.

The addition of Moss marks Vomela’s second acquisition since Riverside’s investment. In July 2025, the company also purchased Printing For Less (PFL), a provider of direct mail automation and print solutions.",https://www.signlink.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BUSINESS_vomela-main.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:07:04.707319

""This is a key moment for our private equity co-investment program which is designed to leverage free-efficient access to high-quality investment opportunities that contribute to stronger retirement outcomes for members,"" she said.

Barclays scams data shows investment scams accounted for 47p in every £1 claimed by victims in 2025 – up from 39p in 2024 and 32p in 2023

While social media remains the biggest source of scams, average monthly volumes of scams originating via text/SMS have increased 40 per cent from 2024

The Barclays Scams Bulletin tracks scam data across personal and business current accounts, paired with expert commentary from Barclays digital safety experts

Half of UK adults (50 per cent) are more worried about falling victim to a scam than they were 12 months ago, according to the latest Barclays Scams Bulletin. As analysis of Barclays’ proprietary data reveals how fraudsters are changing tactics to target victims, Fraud & Scams Expert Kirsty Adams shares her top tips on staying scam safe in 2026.

Investment scams on the rise, accounting for nearly half of every £1 claimed by victims

Barclays’ claims data shows that investment scams accounted for almost half (47 per cent) of the total value of total claims in 2025, up from 39 per cent in 2024 and 32 per cent in 2023. Despite investment scams’ significant share of the overall value of claims, they represent just 7.1 per cent of the volume of reports in 2025 – however, this is up from 5.6 per cent in 2024. Purchase scams maintained the largest share of claims, at 71 per cent, unchanged from last year. One in three (35 per cent) reported investment scams originated on social media.

Fraudsters are turning to text, but social media remains top scam source

Looking more broadly at all scam types, social media remains the biggest source of reports by Gen Z customers in 2025, accounting for six in 10 (58 per cent) cases, compared with 45 per cent across all generations.

Amid significant advances and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence this year, three in four (75 per cent) believe AI has made online scams more convincing. This has led to one in three Gen Z consumers (34 per cent) now actively avoiding online shopping due to scam concerns – the highest rate of any generation, and 12 percentage points higher than older age groups (22 per cent).

Barclays data shows that these scammers have responded to this declining online confidence by pivoting towards more direct and trusted channels. Average monthly reports of scams originating via text/SMS have increased 40 per cent from 2024, now accounting for 14 per cent of claims.

One in four are skipping finfluencer background checks to avoid FOMO

Barclays research also found that 42 per cent of those who acted on social media investment content lost money – and not always by being scammed. While scams involve deliberate fraud, many investors also face losses after following unregulated advice from ‘finfluencers’. One in four (24 per cent) say they feel pressured to act quickly on unsolicited tips, often mistaking displays of wealth for credibility. This rises to 48 per cent among Gen Z (18–27).

Consumers show growing support for data sharing to fight scams

Eight in 10 (81 per cent) consumers believe more work should be done to protect them from scams, and 79 per cent think tech companies should do more to prevent scams occurring on their platforms, up from 75 per cent in spring of this year. Almost half (45 per cent) would welcome tech companies and banks sharing personal data with each other, if it was done to prevent them falling victim to a scam.

Barclays Fraud and Scams Expert Kirsty Adams, says: “Once again, scammers adopted new tactics in 2025, and as a result we saw a shift in the nature of scams reported by our customers. While fraudsters targeted victims with higher-stakes opportunities, we witnessed the resurgence of scams coming via text message, as confidence in online channels has declined.

“There’s no doubt that scammers will attempt to take advantage of shoppers during the festive sales, so we’re urging people to remain vigilant. Looking ahead to 2026, we’re hopeful we will see continued progress in the fight against fraud, in the form of cross-industry collaboration.”

Kirsty’s top tips on staying ahead of the scammers in 2026:

Never disclose personal details: Your bank will never ask you for your debit card PIN, your password, or your complete online banking login details. Requests along these lines should jump out as a red flag.

Verify company details: If you are in doubt about a company that has contacted you by phone, it is always worth double checking their contact details. Check official websites and call the listed number directly yourself.

Take your time: When it comes to making purchases online or committing to an investment, don’t be forced into making any hasty decisions. Always remember that legitimate organisations shouldn’t push you into anything.

Be sceptical of promises: Our data shows the average investment scam claim is higher than any other scam type. Remember the old adage; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, and remain sceptical of any promise of unrealistic returns.

Beware of scam texts: If you’re sent a one-time passcode to authorise a payment or registration, always read the full message to check it matches up with what you’re doing. If it doesn’t, stop the transaction and don’t use the code or give it to anyone.

The American group has announced several significant installations.

According to HP, this dynamic reflects a structural shift in the market towards shorter runs, shorter lead times and more intelligent production environments, notably its PrintOS suite, which enables real-time control of operations via data analysis.

16 new Indigo presses for Cimpress

First example cited: Cimpress, owner of Vistaprint and Pixartprinting, installs 16 HP Indigo presses since Drupa in June 2024, including 10 Indigo 120K models.

The equipment has been deployed at several sites, including Vistaprint Windsor in Canada, Pixartprinting in Italy and Vistaprint Venlo in the Netherlands. HP states that the group has exceeded three million prints, without specifying the reference period.

Robert Keane, founder and CEO of Cimpress, states: ""The HP Indigo 120K model has changed the pace and predictability of our production. We're seeing more stability, shorter lead times and better operational coordination, exactly what our large-scale business needs.""

At European sites, the overall efficiency rate (OEE) is said to exceed 60%. Pixartprinting USA, for its part, is said to have reached the LS Mark Champion level of 180%.

RRD focuses on PageWide and Indigo in several segments

Another customer highlighted by HP is the American company RRD (formerly RR Donnelley), which has accelerated its digital transformation plan on an international scale. The agreement signed with HP at Drupa resulted in several installations of HP Indigo and HP PageWide presses, including the PageWide T4250 HDR model. HP is not disclosing further details of this order.

According to HP, this inkjet press combines high productivity, offset-like quality and a wide range of applications, thanks to a high-definition recirculating nozzle architecture and an optimized drying system.

The manufacturer points out that this configuration makes it possible to better meet growing demand in the mailing, label, packaging and commercial printing sectors, while limiting waste and energy consumption.

Up to 10,000 orders a day with HP 15K and HP Site Flow

Germany-based Friedmann Print, a subsidiary of the Ludo Fact Group, also operates an automated production line combining HP Indigo 15K presses with the HP Site Flow software solution. This system integrates automated order grouping, tracking and planning functionalities.

According to HP, this configuration can handle up to 10,000 unique orders per day for personalized applications such as calendars, cards and collectible games. It could also be used to mass-produce cards with controlled shrinkage via random sequencing, without affecting print speed or quality.

And at peak times, over 150,000 shipments per month would be handled.

The printer would also save 25-30% on paper, thanks to optimized workflows.

A changing production environment for HP

HP emphasizes the convergence between its hardware solutions (Indigo LEPx presses, PageWide HDR inkjet) and its software ecosystem (PrintOS, Site Flow), which it presents as the key to a more resilient and cost-effective production environment.

- Approval builds on a trusted solution in neurovascular embolization for over 25 years.

IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) – Today, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a leader in neurovascular care, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded indication for the TRUFILL n‑BCA Liquid Embolic System for embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) for the treatment of symptomatic subacute and chronic Subdural Hematoma (cSDH) as an adjunct to surgery.

cSDH is often caused by minor head trauma that leads to bleeding between the dura and arachnoid membranes, particularly among older adults and those on anticoagulation therapy. While surgical intervention is the traditional standard of care, recurrence rate estimates range between 10% to 20%. Embolization of the MMA offers a minimally invasive endovascular approach by targeting smaller brain vessels thought to contribute to hematoma persistence and regrowth.1

The approval is supported by findings from the MEMBRANE randomized controlled trial, which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of MMA embolization in patients with cSDH2. The results of the MEMBRANE study demonstrated that TRUFILL n-BCA is superior in effectiveness compared to Standard of Care (SOC) for embolization in the MMA for the treatment of symptomatic cSDHi, and importantly, TRUFILL n-BCA was demonstrated to be safe for treating cSDH2.

""This approval reinforces the enduring value of TRUFILL n-BCA and our commitment to delivering innovative technologies that improve outcomes for patients and address complex neurovascular conditions,"" said Christian Cuzick, President, Worldwide Neurovascular, Johnson & Johnson MedTech.

""There is an unmet need for new treatment options for chronic subdural hematoma, particularly for patients at risk of recurrence or complications from surgery,"" said Dr. Chris Kellnerii, Director of Cerebrovascular & Intercerebral Hemorrhage programs, Mount Sinai, and investigator in the MEMBRANE trial. ""The MEMBRANE study demonstrated a positive treatment effect in favor of TRUFILL over standard of care and reinforces the potential of MMA embolization to improve outcomes for patients with cSDH.""

TRUFILL n-BCA has been a trusted solution in neurovascular embolization for over 25 years, supporting the treatment of patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) since its original FDA approval in 2000. This expanded indication brings TRUFILL n-BCA's established performance into the treatment of cSDH, a condition where traditional surgical interventions may not always be suitable or effective for long-term control.

The reality is that in many cases, the existing inventory of finished buildings can be purchased at prices significantly below the cost of new construction. An exception to this could be in the industrial sector, although for residential, office, and retail assets, sale prices are very favorable.

Depending on the sector, financing is also challenging, especially for office development (and acquisition) as most lenders are extremely concerned and not willing to provide debt, in general, for projects. Financing for most other asset classes is available, although at lower loan-to-value or loan-to-cost than historically achievable, thereby requiring more equity from the developer or buyer.

What do you think are the biggest construction needs in Minnesota?

Affordable Housing. There are more people in need of shelter today than ever before in modern history. While we have wonderful organizations and developers doing this work, the high cost and complicated system to navigate the required capital stack is becoming more challenging to accomplish. As such, new streamlined processing, along with new incentives to promote more affordable housing, must be created to make this happen.

What’s the biggest misconception you encounter about your work?

Many believe that real estate development is easy and overflowing with profit. In reality, real estate development is tough on a “good day” and very challenging on a “difficult day.” Our marketplace today mostly reflects a “difficult day,” or more specifically, a challenging 5-1/2 years. There are so many lingering and current headwinds in the Twin Cites which still need to be navigated.

The United Kingdom government has laid final legislation before parliament to provide a regulatory regime for digital assets, set to come into force in 2027. It gives the country’s top finance sector watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the necessary powers to oversee the space and integrate digital assets into the country’s financial regulation. In response, the FCA launched a consultation on its proposed approach, promising to take into account the “unique aspects of cryptoassets.”

UK sets FCA oversight for cryptoassets

Crypto regulation endures U.K. political shift

Clarity arrives for digital asset firms

FCA advances rulebook for crypto firms

On Monday, HM Treasury laid the final draft of a ‘statutory instrument’ before parliament that will create new regulated activities for ‘cryptoassets’ and place the sector within the FCA’s jurisdictional oversight, allowing the regulator to finally bring digital assets within the U.K.’s financial regulatory regime.

“Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the U.K.’s position as a world leading financial centre in the digital age,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves MP said. “By giving firms clear rules of the road, we are providing the certainty they need to invest, innovate and create high skilled jobs here in the UK, while giving millions strong consumer protections, and locking dodgy actors out of the U.K. market.”

The digital asset sector remains largely unregulated in the U.K., barring anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) rules, and those related to the promotion of financial products.

However, according to the Treasury’s December 15 announcement, the legislation presented to parliament will provide “firm and proportionate rules” that will come into force from 2027, “giving firms legal clarity over the sector’s regulatory position and boosting consumer confidence by ensuring consumers are robustly protected.”

The major change will be that digital asset firms will need to be regulated by the FCA in the same way as other providers of financial products, including being subject to the established transparency standards and licensing regime.

“Cryptoassets firms will be backed to innovate and grow under plans to make the UK a global destination for digital assets and attract more investment,” the Treasury said. “Consumers will be protected by bringing cryptoassets into scope of similar rules to those for other regulated financial products like stocks and shares.”

Meanwhile, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby KC MP, placed the emphasis very much on supporting the digital asset sector, saying that “by establishing a comprehensive regulatory regime for cryptoassets, the government is taking another step towards delivering on its ambition for the UK to be a world-leading hub for digital finance.”

Slow road to regulation

In October 2023, HM Treasury, under the previous Conservative government of Rishi Sunak, published detailed proposals for creating a U.K. financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets, including stablecoins. Essentially, it involved a mix of integrating cryptoassets into existing financial regulation with certain bespoke new rules.

When 14 years of Conservative rule came to an end in July of last year, a certain amount of uncertainty crept back in as industry and observers awaited what the new Labour government would do. However, in November of last year, the Treasury confirmed that it will proceed with introducing the regime broadly in line with the previously published proposals.

An end to uncertainty

The long-awaited progress toward substantive regulation for digital assets in the U.K. received a warm response from some working in the area, who have been living in a state of limbo and uncertainty for some time.

Hannah Meakin, partner at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, told CoinGeek that the legislation represents “the corner piece of the jigsaw because it provides key definitions and explains how cryptoassets will be able to be offered to the public and listed, what types of abusive behaviour will be prohibited and which activities will require authorisation.”

With the legislation now in place and set to come into force in 2027, the next stage of the process will involve the FCA, whose job it will be to regulate the digital asset space, firming up how it proposes to slot the new asset class into the existing regulation framework.

“The FCA will be able to develop the rules and guidance it has proposed, and industry will be able to provide more informed feedback to help make the final regime as effective as possible,” said Meakin. “There are already some key provisions, such as for information sharing between authorised persons to combat market abuse and the prospect of a list of legitimate market practices as carve-outs to the offences.”

She added that “We will see more tailoring to the particular characteristics of cryptoassets at the next level, where the FCA has significant power to design the detailed rules.”

With this in mind, following the Treasury’s introduction of the final legislation to parliament on Monday, the FCA launched a consultation on its proposed approach to digital asset regulation.

FCA consultation

On Tuesday, hot on the heels of the Treasury’s announcement, the FCA published a consultation on its proposed rules and guidance for firms conducting regulated cryptoasset activities, such as trading platforms, intermediaries (including cryptoasset lending and borrowing), staking and decentralized finance (DeFi).

“Under the government’s plans, our regulatory remit for cryptoassets will expand from the current Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs) and financial promotions regime to a more comprehensive crypto regime,” said the regulator. “Our proposed rules and guidance are aimed at effectively promoting market integrity, protecting consumers, and supporting innovation and competition in the UK cryptoasset sector.”

Likely much to the relief of digital asset-market participants, the FCA also confirmed its consultation would take into account “the unique aspects of cryptoassets” when deciding their place in the future regulatory regime.

The collaboration will combine Pearson’s expertise in skills development with IBM’s watsonx AI technology to create personalised learning tools for businesses, public-sector organisations, and educational institutions.

The announcement follows research from Pearson indicating that inefficient career transitions and skills mismatches could cost the US economy $1.1 trillion in lost earnings annually. Both companies say the partnership is intended to help close that gap by enabling faster, more relevant skills acquisition as AI reshapes job roles and training needs.

Developing New AI Learning Platforms

Under the agreement, IBM and Pearson will co-develop learning products powered by watsonx Orchestrate and watsonx Governance, with availability planned globally. IBM will also help Pearson build a custom AI-powered learning platform, modelled on IBM’s internal Consulting Advantage system, which blends human expertise with AI assistants, agents and workflow assets.

According to both companies, the platform is designed to support Pearson’s long-term transformation efforts by improving operational efficiency, enhancing data-driven decision-making and accelerating the development of new learning products and services.

Workforce transformation and employee upskilling

IBM named Pearson its primary strategic partner for customer upskilling and workforce transformation. As part of the partnership, IBM customers — and IBM’s own workforce of more than 270,000 employees — will have access to Pearson’s enterprise learning solutions. These include:

Credly, used for digital credentialing

Faethm, for strategic workforce planning

Pearson Professional Assessments, which delivers IBM’s professional certification exams globally

The companies will also explore the development of tools to verify the capabilities of AI agents before deployment. IBM said the effort combines its work in responsible AI with Pearson’s expertise in assessment and credentialing.

Leadership Perspectives

“Technology is evolving faster than human skills can keep pace. To close this gap, learning must be embedded seamlessly into the flow of work. When people learn where work happens, it has an immediate impact on productivity and performance,” said Omar Abbosh, CEO of Pearson. “Together with IBM, we’re building trusted AI-powered learning tools that will help people and organisations adapt, learn, and thrive in a world of constant change.”

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the collaboration aims to scale access to AI-enabled learning: “Whether you’re leading a company or just graduating, everyone needs to build new skills for the AI era. IBM and Pearson are bringing AI-powered education to more organisations to help people learn faster.”

The case for Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly recently crossed $1 trillion in market cap, becoming the first healthcare company to do so. The only real surprise was how quickly it happened, but given the company's incredible growth prospects, it's something I expected would happen eventually.

The business has been booming thanks to Lilly's highly popular and effective GLP-1 drugs. Through the first nine months of the year, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss) have generated a combined $25 billion in revenue. That's more than half of the $46 billion in total sales the company reported over that time frame.

In a head-to-head trial against Novo Nordisk's top weight loss drug, Wegovy, Zepbound has proven to be more effective in helping people shed pounds (with a 20.2% average weight loss versus 13.7%, over a 72-week trial). Going with the leading GLP-1 brand could be a no-brainer move for investors. Plus, Lilly has a promising Alzheimer's drug in Kisunla, which regulators approved last year.

Eli Lilly's been a growth machine. Although it has soared more than 570% in five years, it could still go even higher in the long term.

The case for Novo Nordisk

Novo Nordisk has been a troubled stock over the past 12 months, but it's a company that I believe can turn things around. Investing in Novo Nordisk, the company behind the popular diabetes drug Ozempic, does come with a bit of risk these days. It's changed CEOs, and it slashed its guidance due to competition from compounded versions of its drugs, which explains the sharp reduction in its share price.

But these problems are temporary in nature, so I remain bullish on the stock over the long haul. And it's during ""temporary trouble"" that billionaire investor Warren Buffett says is a great time to invest in a company. Novo Nordisk is trading at a heavily discounted valuation -- just 14 times its trailing earnings. By comparison, Eli Lilly trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of over 50. Expectations are far lower for Novo Nordisk than they are for its rival, and that can work to the advantage of investors who buy the healthcare stock now.

During the first nine months of 2025, Ozempic has generated sales growth of 13% at constant exchange rates, while Wegovy has grown by 54%. Ozempic was first approved in 2017 and has a long track record; its ability to still rise at such a decent pace is a strong testament to its brand. (Lilly's Mounjaro, by comparison, was approved in 2022.) Wegovy's approval came in 2021.

There's a lot of bad news and bearish expectations baked into Novo Nordisk's stock right now, but the reality is that its fundamentals remain solid. Investors who stay the course could be rewarded handsomely.

Novo Nordisk looks like the better stock today

I continue to own shares of Novo Nordisk despite its recent adversity because I'm confident the business can and will turn things around. It's still developing more GLP-1 drugs, and all it takes is one promising study to remind investors just how much growth there is in the GLP-1 market; it's not a winner-take-all arena, and there's room for multiple big players.

With its severely undervalued shares, Novo Nordisk has much more upside than Eli Lilly. While both stocks are excellent investments when looking at the long haul, the Danish drugmaker gives investors more value for their money today.

This is equivalent in size to Nvidia’s two California “spaceships” combined and will be considered the largest technology campus in Israel.
Nvidia Israel currently has about 400 open positions.
The final decision was made last week during a visit by Nvidia Israel executives, led by Amit Krig, to the company’s U.S. headquarters.
This, in turn, placed pressure on the Israel Land Authority, which moved swiftly to accommodate the company.","Now it is official: Nvidia’s spacecraft is set to land in Kiryat Tivon. After a five-month process in which the world’s most valuable company examined several alternatives for establishing a new mega-campus in Israel, Nvidia has chosen Kiryat Tivon. The company, currently valued at about $4.3 trillion, will purchase the land from the state for approximately NIS 90 million (approximately $28 million), making it the first international technology company in Israel to build a major campus on land it owns. Until now, the campuses of multinational giants such as Intel, Microsoft, Google, and Meta have all been located in leased properties.

The decision signals an extraordinary level of commitment by Nvidia to Israel, which has already become the company’s second-largest development center outside the United States.

With the official announcement, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said: “Israel is home to some of the world’s most brilliant technologists and has become NVIDIA’s second home. Our new campus will be a place where our teams can collaborate, invent, and build the future of AI. This investment reflects our deep and enduring commitment to our families in Israel and their unique contributions to the AI era.”

Amit Krig, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering and Israel Site Leader, added: “NVIDIA’s growth in Israel has been remarkable, driven by the extraordinary talent and engineering excellence of our teams. We’re grateful to Jensen and NVIDIA’s leadership for their trust and support in this next phase of growth, and to the Ministry of Treasury and the Israel Land Authority for their partnership. We look forward to bringing this vision to life and continuing to build the future of AI.”

The new campus, designed in the shape of a “spaceship,” similar to Nvidia’s headquarters in Silicon Valley, will be built on approximately 90 dunams and span about 160,000 square meters. This is equivalent in size to Nvidia’s two California “spaceships” combined and will be considered the largest technology campus in Israel.

The complex will include a park, cafés, restaurants, and shared workspaces, effectively functioning as a self-contained city, in line with the campus models of companies such as Google and Apple in the U.S. It is expected to accommodate more than 10,000 employees. Construction is slated to begin about a year after Nvidia completes its planning processes, with occupancy expected in 2031. The estimated cost of the project runs into the billions of shekels.

This will be Nvidia’s first “spaceship-style” campus outside the U.S., although the company is also advancing plans for a similar site in Taiwan, near the factories that manufacture its GPUs, which currently dominate the global artificial intelligence chip market.

Nvidia currently employs around 5,000 people in Israel, with its largest site located in Yokneam, built on the foundations of Mellanox, which Nvidia acquired in 2020 for $7 billion. The company also occupies roughly half the floors of the Rubinstein Towers in Tel Aviv and recently announced an expansion in Be’er Sheva, where it plans to employ hundreds of workers in the Gav-Yam high-tech park.

Beyond office space, Nvidia operates a server farm in Israel and the Israel-1 supercomputer, ranked among the world’s 50 most powerful. On Wednesday, Calcalist revealed that Nvidia is also planning to establish another server farm, the largest in Israel, adjacent to its existing facility in the Mevo Carmel industrial zone. The total investment in that project is estimated at $1.5 billion and will be shared between Nvidia and the real estate company Mega Or, with which it is in advanced negotiations.

Nvidia Israel currently has about 400 open positions. Israel is now the company’s second-largest global center, with a hiring pace exceeded only by the United States and surpassing Nvidia’s growth rates in both Europe and India.

The Kiryat Tivon site was selected from a long list of proposals Nvidia received after publishing a public request for information in July. While the state sought to steer the company toward more northern locations, such as Kiryat Ata, to support areas affected by the war, Nvidia ultimately preferred to remain close to its existing operations in Yokneam and the server farms in Mevo Carmel.

The final decision was made last week during a visit by Nvidia Israel executives, led by Amit Krig, to the company’s U.S. headquarters. During that visit, Jensen Huang also met Avinan Or, an Nvidia employee who was kidnapped on October 7 and released in the most recent deal.

Nvidia had been exploring options for a northern campus for some time, but slow progress with government agencies prompted the company to launch a public land-search process. This, in turn, placed pressure on the Israel Land Authority, which moved swiftly to accommodate the company. This week, the government approved the land allocation at a discount of about NIS 70 million ($21.7M), without Nvidia having requested one. The approval required signatures from the defense and finance ministers, as Israeli law mandates such approval for land transactions with entities not registered in Israel.",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2025/12/17/SkU00JXemZg/SkU00JXemZg_0_130_3000_1689_0_large.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 04:59:28.832878

https://ankar.ai/ About Atomico Atomico is the founder-built European venture capital firm.","Ankar raises $20M (£15M) in Series A funding led by Atomico to transform how breakthrough ideas become protected innovation

Ankar is building the AI operating system for innovation, reinventing how companies generate and protect their inventions

Ankar has seen strong growth and secured leading customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as L’Oreal and global law firm Vorys

New funding led by Atomico will be used to scale the go-to-product, engineering and go-to-market teams and grow Ankar’s AI-powered patent platform globally

London, UK, 17 December 2025: Ankar, the AI platform transforming how companies and law firms capture and protect their patents, has raised a $20 million (£15 million) Series A round led by Atomico, with Index Ventures doubling down and Norrsken VC and Daphni participating. The company will use the funding to grow its team and expand further into the US.

Invention is how humanity’s biggest challenges are solved, and AI is fundamentally changing how inventions become protected assets. It enables patent teams to analyse novelty, draft claims and evaluate prior art with unprecedented depth and speed. Yet fragmented tools, gaps in AI trust, and slow enterprise adoption have held organisations back. Ankar solves these challenges with an operating system that unifies the entire patent lifecycle into one secure workflow for the first time.

Its platform orchestrates how ideas become defensible IP globally, bringing novelty assessment, drafting and prosecution together so teams can do in hours what once took weeks. Acting as an assistant rather than an autopilot, Ankar delivers end-to-end strategic patent generation with stronger claims, clearer framing and more defensible portfolios.

Fixing a broken system

Patents can take up to 24 months to secure and still rely on scattered Word documents, spreadsheets, emails and outdated IP systems. This inefficiency slows teams down and discourages inventors from filing altogether.

Ankar replaces this fragmented process with a unified platform that supports the entire patent lifecycle. It performs instant novelty and prior-art analysis across 150+ million patent applications and 250+ million scientific publications, turns invention disclosures into high-quality draft applications with strategic guidance on claim strength and scope, and consolidates all history and analysis into a single view when examiners respond – enabling faster, stronger and more defensible outcomes, just as competition for IP is intensifying.

Built for security in the AI era

Patent workflows require the highest confidentiality in the enterprise world, and Ankar has been built for this. Co-founders Tamar Gomez and Wiem Gharbi previously built mission-critical software at Palantir in Europe and the US, experience that now shapes Ankar’s approach to secure patent retrieval, claim-level reasoning, LLM governance and AI safety inside enterprise-controlled environments.

This matters more than ever: generative AI is making it easier for competitors to replicate designs, architectures and experimental approaches. As a result, C-suites, especially in automotive, electronics and other R&D-heavy sectors, are prioritising deeper, more defensible patent portfolios to secure future revenue.

The company’s platform helps patent teams go from idea to granted patent in a fraction of the time, delivering an average 40% boost in productivity and hundreds of hours shifted to high-value work. This is vital, as figures show that intangible assets such as IP now make up to 90% of the value of S&P 500 companies, yet patent professionals still spend around half of their time on manual, administrative work. Ankar is already showing meaningful adoption, with 96% of users saying they would recommend the platform to colleagues.

Accelerating growth

This Series A brings Ankar’s total funding to $24 million. The capital will be used to double the company’s 20-person team, expand engineering, product and design, and grow Ankar’s go-to-market organisation to support rising demand across Europe and the US. The long-term ambition is to become the software layer that orchestrates how ideas turn into defensible patents globally, which will be the core infrastructure of innovation in the AI era.

Tamar Gomez, co-founder of Ankar AI, said: “Invention is how we solve humanity’s biggest challenges, yet the systems that protect those ideas are decades out of date. AI will redefine how global organisations innovate over the next five years, turning IP from a cost centre into a growth driver. The companies that adopt Ankar now will shape the future of innovation.”

Wiem Gharbi, co-founder of Ankar AI, said: “Patents sit at the intersection of deep technical knowledge and precise legal reasoning, and AI can finally unlock real leverage in that process. Ankar gives professionals the analytical depth they’ve never had before, enabling stronger strategy and better protection. Atomico shares our ambition to build the infrastructure behind the next generation of global innovation.”

Andreas Helbig, partner at Atomico, said: “Tamar and Wiem bring exceptional technical depth and first-hand experience of how broken the patent process is. Their momentum with Fortune 500 companies shows they’re building the right product at exactly the right moment. We’re proud to support their mission as they build the foundational infrastructure for how the world’s most important ideas are protected and commercialised.”

Jean-Yves Legendre, Competitive IP Intelligence Manager at L’Oréal, said: “Most vendors came with a fixed solution. With Ankar, they began with our needs. They understood patents, spoke our language, and adapted to our needs by configuring their existing technology into a solution that fits our reality.”

U.S. Bancorp Investment Narrative Recap

To own U.S. Bancorp, you need to believe its mix of traditional banking and fee-based payments can keep earning power resilient while digital competitors intensify. The Avvance and Coinstar expansions modestly reinforce the near term catalyst around digital engagement and payments, but they do not alter the key risk that faster moving fintech and non-banks could chip away at fee income over time.

Among recent developments, the expanded Coinstar partnership is especially relevant, as it extends everyday banking access beyond branches and supports the same digital and payments narrative that underpins Avvance’s embedded lending push.

Yet even as U.S. Bancorp leans into digital access and payments, investors should be aware of the growing threat from faster moving fintech rivals and...

On December 12, Barclays analyst Benjamin Budish raised the firm’s price target on Robinhood to $171 from $168, while keeping an Overweight rating on the shares. As part of its 2026 plan, Barclays revised targets for companies within the financial services group. Budish anticipates constructive market conditions next year, especially benefiting alternative asset managers and wealth brokers. The outlook is less clear, however, for exchanges and traditional asset managers, which are expected to face a more mixed environment.

In Q3 2025, Robinhood Markets achieved record revenues of ~$1.3 billion, which represented a doubling (over 100%) year-over-year increase. EPS more than tripled from the previous year and totaled $0.61, which was $0.07 higher than estimates. The company’s subscription service, Robinhood Gold, reached a record 3.9 million subscribers, showing over 75% year-over-year growth and strong adoption, particularly among new customers.

A key area of growth for Robinhood is its prediction markets business, which has shown rapid acceleration, doubling volume every quarter to 2.3 billion contracts in Q3. This segment surpassed $100 million in annualized revenue and is tracking towards a $300 million run rate. The company sees its competitive advantage in this area as its distribution, using its ecosystem of over 26 million funded accounts.

The financing supports a diverse portfolio of 45 wind and solar projects located across Germany and France.
CEE RF9 will repower at least 29 projects with state-of-the-art wind turbines and photovoltaic modules.
The cashflows generated by operating assets serve as a substitute for equity and set new standards for institutional renewable energy investments.

The financing structure for CEE RF9 is unique for alternative investment funds which belongs to CEE Group, an asset manager specialized in renewable energies and part of the Canadian Brookfield Asset Management Group. The financing supports a diverse portfolio of 45 wind and solar projects located across Germany and France. In addition to providing lending capacity, ING acted as Original Issuing Bank, while UniCredit served as Facility and Security Agent, Hedge Coordinator and Account Bank.

CEE RF9 will repower at least 29 projects with state-of-the-art wind turbines and photovoltaic modules. As a result, the installed capacity of the overall portfolio will increase from the current 457 MW(p) to approximately 1.1 GW(p), which corresponds to an expansion of more than 140%.

This transaction marks a milestone in the German renewables market, as it enables the consolidation of investment fund financing at the portfolio level for the first time and does not require additional equity from existing investors. The cashflows generated by operating assets serve as a substitute for equity and set new standards for institutional renewable energy investments.

“This landmark transaction demonstrates the continued appetite of international lenders to support innovative renewable energy solutions in Europe, having advised on this unique portfolio financing structure to accelerate the expansion and repowering strategy of renewable energy projects will make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy sector and the achievement of climate goals” said White & Case partner Florian Degenhardt who led the Firm’s deal team.

CEE RF9 was launched at the turn of 2024/2025 as the latest generation of the successful “CEE Renewables Fund/RF” product series. The fund transferred existing portfolios consisting of 45 European PV and onshore wind assets from previous CEE RF funds to the new platform, with the aim of extensive repowering by 2030.

The agreement was signed at dfcu Bank’s head offices in Nakasero, Kampala, and establishes a long-term strategic partnership focused on advancing the bank’s digital transformation agenda.

Central to the collaboration is the development and deployment of an enterprise-grade software integration platform, an API Gateway, designed to securely link dfcu Bank’s internal systems with external partners across multiple sectors.

The API Gateway is expected to enhance interoperability, speed up collaboration, and support product co-creation in banking, insurance, telecommunications, education, and other industries that increasingly depend on seamless digital integration.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, dfcu Bank Chief Executive Officer Charles Mudiwa said the partnership marked a key milestone in the bank’s transformation journey and reflected its commitment to innovation and customer-centric service delivery.

He said upgrading core systems was essential to making the bank future-ready and competitive in a rapidly evolving digital economy.

Mudiwa noted that customer expectations have shifted significantly due to rapid technological change, with clients increasingly demanding convenience, reliability, and efficient service delivery.

He said dfcu’s digital strategy is aimed at ensuring customers can access modern banking services seamlessly, anytime and anywhere.

According to him, the goal is to make banking fit naturally into customers’ lives rather than requiring customers to adjust their routines to access financial services.

dfcu Bank’s Chief Technology, Digital and Operations Officer Musa Musazi said the API Gateway will act as a central integration layer, enabling secure and seamless communication between dfcu Bank and its partners.

He explained that through the platform, customers of dfcu Bank and partner institutions will be able to access each other’s products and services, expanding reach and creating added value for all stakeholders.

For the past two years, L’Oréal has been holding its Big Bang Beauty Tech Innovation Program in the SAPMENA region, designed to discover, support and nurture promising startups from across the

region with an opportunity to develop their pilots in beauty tech innovation.

The top Grand Finale winners receive a L’Oréal-funded commercial pilot opportunity and a year-long mentorship programme with senior executives from L’Oréal and the programme partners. Startups that run successful pilots in SAPMENA could gain access to L’Oréal’s global network, with the SAPMENA region acting as a launchpad to leverage valuable partnerships and market insights.

Campaign Asia-Pacific spoke with Lex Bradshaw-Zanger, L’Oréal chief marketing & digital officer, South Asia Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, to find out more about why the beauty giant is keen to partner with startups to stay ahead, how much AI and emerging technology is impacting sales, and balancing the focus on technology and innovation with the need for human oversight to remain competitive in the fast-evolving beauty landscape.

You recently held the Big Bang Beauty Tech Innovation Program grand finale in Singapore. What exactly is L’Oreal looking for in these startups, especially since beauty tech has been around a while now?

Lex Bradshaw-Zanger: Beauty tech means many things for us. It embodies how we integrate digital and data technology into our business, right from upstream scientific research in our labs to downstream marketing. Last year, we focused on media, marketing, and commerce, but this year we broadened it to include research and operations. We're interested in new ideas that accelerate brand innovation and those founders or teams passionate about making a difference alongside our global beauty brands. We know it’s not easy for startups to work with a big corporate, so we've learned to create ways to build real partnerships.

Is one goal to identify missing capabilities in beauty tech that L'Oreal might eventually acquire?

Acquisition is always a possibility. For example, we acquired ModiFace, an AR/VR startup we first partnered with in 2018. They now provide services across many of our brands globally. But not everything leads to acquisition. Many partnerships focus on leveraging technology differently or more efficiently. We have venture funds and scouting programs to explore all these timelines, from pilots in local markets to scaling globally.

Do startups you partner with see a direct impact, like increased sales?

While I don’t have specific numbers, that’s definitely part of the plan. We commit to commercial pilots with them and provide mentorship across our global ecosystem, including partners like Google, Meta, and Accenture. We also help raise their visibility through PR and brand association. It’s designed as a win-win: startups get access and growth opportunities, and we gain fresh innovation. Some technologies, like AI-enabled dubbing, crowdsourced creative content, and TV-to-e-commerce integrations, are already enhancing marketing performance and consumer conversion.

How much of this is about marketing innovation?

Marketing today is about doing both simple things better at scale, with AI efficiency, and creating new excitement and relevance. These startups show both ends of the spectrum: increasing quality and scale in content production and pioneering innovative formats like direct TV integration.

How is AI changing product creation and personalisation at L’Oréal?

We were recently voted the most innovative AI company in Europe. AI helps us move beyond PowerPoint ideas to real enterprise-grade solutions across the value chain, from speeding product development and using molecular databases in partnership with IBM, to automating content production for e-commerce and creating personalised marketing briefs internally through our own AI 'create tech' platform. AI also helps sift and analyse consumer data for better insights. It’s human plus machine, boosting speed, efficiency, and sustainability.

What about human oversight versus automation? What ethical considerations do you uphold?

Human oversight is always essential. We haven’t moved to fully automated AI. For example, customer chats always have an option to switch to a human agent. We’ve committed to not creating AI-generated human images like hair or skin because we sell real products for real people. Transparency about AI use is key, as is our internal AI ethics board that reviews new products. As we enter this post-truth era, brand quality, reputation, and consistency become more important than ever.

How do you handle concerns in this 'post-truth' era about AI-generated content versus human authenticity?

We take responsibility seriously and are transparent about AI use. We don't use AI to create deceptive images or content. Brand quality and trust will be paramount as consumers seek consistent, credible products and messaging.

Can you share some particularly exciting startups from your current program?

Sure. One is Halo AI from Dubai. They use AI to identify influencers and manage outreach in beauty advocacy. Another is an Indian startup called Without that transforms unrecyclable waste into recyclable material, aligning with our sustainability goals. Sravathi AI is also an Indian startup that works on bringing AI into upstream lab chemistry for product development. Heat Seeker out of Australia creates synthetic consumer data to gain insights when real-world testing isn’t feasible. Plus, Wubble out of Singapore uses AI to help real musicians produce bespoke brand music, which we could use in stores or ads. These examples cover a broad spectrum from sustainability to consumer insights and content creation.

What are common roadblocks when working with startups and how do you overcome them?

Complexities like legal, compliance, security issues in large corporations can be tough for startups. We create special frameworks and pilot projects to help startups navigate these. We also coach startups on adapting their pitches and understanding our specific needs. It’s about a mutually beneficial learning and growth process.

Why do so many startups (80%) struggle to scale, and how do you help close that gap?

Having a good idea isn’t enough. It needs to fit the right brand, product, market, and moment. We commit to pilots with selected startups to limit pitching and focus on action. During this, we help them refine their propositions and approach. It’s like tailoring a cover letter to a job, understanding what customers need and when.

Are you worried about nurturing future competitors by working with startups?

We believe it’s about adding capability to grow the category as a whole. We’re the number one beauty company and see it as our responsibility to lead innovation and ecosystem building. We don’t see startups working with us as direct competitors but as partners advancing the industry.

How do you see beauty tech and AI evolving in the future?

Three areas: First, AI in product creation—faster, smarter, sustainable processes. Second, AI changing brand-consumer interaction through virtual trials, skin analysis, and personalised e-commerce experiences. Third, AI driving efficiency internally across all functions, factories, labs, offices, with AI tools empowering our teams.

What are your hopes for the Big Bang Beauty Tech Innovation Program and how do you see it fostering innovation through partnerships with startups going forward?

Open innovation is a big focus for us. It’s about finding opportunities, partnering with startups, and mentoring them for mutual success beyond just one-off pilot deals. We are building a community to foster ongoing innovation across many markets and brands, supported by our accelerator based here in Paris.

What’s really important for me, I’ve said this many times, is creating a true win-win. It’s not just about paying a startup for a pilot with one brand; we offer 12 months of mentoring support. I personally get involved in three or four of those mentorships, where I meet the startups to share experience on working with our teams and to help with their pitch decks. We also connect them with our partners who can help them scale and grow. Our approach goes beyond just finding new technology, it’s about building lasting, collaborative relationships that enable startups to thrive and innovate alongside L’Oréal, creating benefits for both sides.

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, NVDA is a Outperform.

Nvidia’s strong financial performance and positive earnings call sentiment are the most significant factors driving the stock score. However, technical analysis indicates potential bearish momentum, and the high valuation suggests limited upside potential.

Positioned to challenge market leaders in the sports betting space, the campaign introduces a bold tone aligned with betr’s stated ambition and innovation. According to the company, the campaign is designed to disrupt the current landscape and reflect a more modern approach.

“The market has been crying out for something more distinctive, and interesting in the sports betting space. At betr, we’re not interested in being part of the herd,” said Tony Thomas, Chief Marketing Officer of betr.

“This campaign, featuring The GOAT, talks to our ambition to stay ahead of the game & two steps ahead of the competition.”

“We are very excited about this new campaign for betr. The central tenet is based around ‘The goat’—the greatest of all time, who is literally, always one step ahead,” said Matt Keon, Chief Creative Officer of TBWA\Sydney.

“In terms of disruption, we have genuinely disrupted the betting category. A category stuck in over stereotyped cliché portrayals of Aussies and created something distinctive that can work across all channels in potent ways.”

When asked for a statement, The Goat nodded in agreement.

The campaign includes a series of films produced by Good Oil, featuring practical animatronics created by Oscar-winning studio Weta. The work is running nationally across all channels in collaboration with PHD Media.

But the U.S. oil industry still has some skin in the game when it comes to Venezuela.
Gulf Coast refiners in particular.
So, if there is a regime change after all, the U.S. lifts sanctions and Venezuelan oil flows more freely to Gulf Coast refiners.
In that case… “Heavy crude pricing would get more expensive,” Chowdhury said.","All the very serious geopolitical implications aside, economically, a U.S. blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers couldn’t really come at a better time. Globally, there is a glut of crude oil — prices are low and over the years, the U.S. has mostly weaned itself off of Venezuelan oil because of production decreases and sanctions. But the U.S. oil industry still has some skin in the game when it comes to Venezuela. Gulf Coast refiners in particular.

Years before fracking, the U.S. looked to Latin America for oil, especially Venezuela and Mexico. The problem was their oil was heavier — syrupy.

“U.S. refiners invested about $100 billion from 1990 to 2010 to handle heavier crudes as global supply patterns changed because of the additional heavy crude that was coming from Venezuela and Mexico,” said Debnil Chowdhury with S&P Global Energy.

But that $100 billion bet didn’t go as planned. Gregory Brew with the Eurasia Group said in Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela, and his administration took a more aggressive nationalist stance and seized assets from U.S. oil companies.

“[There’s also been] years of general mismanagement and technical inefficiencies on the side of Venezuelans,” Brew said.

And the U.S. imposed sanctions.

So, those Gulf Coast refineries made for Venezuelan oil, found themselves largely without. They’ve pivoted, but it’s still not an ideal match.

“Even though refineries have changed into processing much more light oil, they still are thirsty for heavy,” said Francisco Monaldi with Rice University.

So, if there is a regime change after all, the U.S. lifts sanctions and Venezuelan oil flows more freely to Gulf Coast refiners.

“The Venezuelan barrels, I think, would slip right into our system very effectively,” said Dan Pickering with Pickering Energy Partners. “It would be a positive on the margin for U.S. gasoline consumers and the U.S. refining system.”

But regime change is a big if, so there’s another scenario to consider: a sustained blockade with large amounts of heavy Venezuelan crude taken out of the global market. In that case…

“Heavy crude pricing would get more expensive,” Chowdhury said.

Refineries would keep operating — but it could hurt their margins.",https://img.apmcdn.org/be882ea8294357ac4f3d6a58a820a0309d628eb9/widescreen/a3368d-20251217-a-mural-depicting-an-oil-pump-and-the-venezuelan-flag-2000.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 21:00:03.479005

Delta Air Lines DAL said on Wednesday that Glen Hauenstein, its president and the architect of its premium-focused strategy, will retire in February.

Hauenstein, 64, joined the Atlanta-based airline in 2005 and has served as president since 2016. During his tenure, he led a sweeping transformation that repositioned Delta from a mass-market carrier to a premium brand.

He championed high-end products and persuaded travelers to pay for seats, such as first class, that were once given away as free upgrades.

The strategy has delivered strong results: premium products accounted for 43% of Delta's passenger revenue in the latest quarter, up eight percentage points from pre-pandemic levels.

Executives now expect revenue from premium cabins to surpass main cabin ticket sales as early as 2026.

""Glen's vision and strategic mindset have been essential in transforming Delta into the leading global airline we are today,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said.

Under Hauenstein's leadership, Delta generated far more revenue per seat than its rivals, more than twice the industry average, according to Jefferies analysts.

The company's success has forced rivals United UAL and American Airlines AAL to follow suit, investing heavily in upgraded cabins and luxury ground experiences to attract high-paying travelers.

Hauenstein also drove the shift in loyalty programs to reward total spending rather than miles flown, a model now standard among major U.S. carriers.

""It's hard to know whether you're lucky or good, but I would say he was good before he was lucky,"" said Robert Mann, a former airline executive turned consultant.

Hauenstein was instrumental in expanding Delta's global footprint, building a network that spans six continents and forging joint ventures with carriers such as Virgin Atlantic, Air France-KLM AF, and Korean Air 003490.

He will retire on February 28 but remain with Delta through 2026 as a strategic adviser.

The airline named Joe Esposito, senior vice president of network planning, as executive vice president and chief commercial officer. Esposito will oversee revenue management, sales, and the SkyMiles loyalty program.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 23:03:26.048830

Its software platform supports patent professionals throughout the entire lifecycle of intellectual property, from idea capture and novelty assessment to drafting, prosecution and portfolio strategy.

The platform unifies fragmented patent tasks into a secure, unified workflow that allows users to manage everything in one place rather than across disconnected documents, spreadsheets and legacy systems. The platform helps users to create patent plans from start to finish, including making claims, clearer descriptions and more secure patent portfolios.

Under the hood, the platform uses AI to accelerate and enhance key patent processes, including performing instant novelty and prior-art analysis across hundreds of millions of patent applications and scientific publications. The platform is also built with robust governance and secure data controls tailored for sensitive patent work to ensure that corporate inventions and proprietary information remain protected throughout the IP generation and prosecution process.

“Invention is how we solve humanity’s biggest challenges, yet the systems that protect those ideas are decades out of date,” said co-founder Tamar Gomez. “AI will redefine how global organizations innovate over the next five years, turning IP from a cost center into a growth driver. The companies that adopt Ankar now will shape the future of innovation.”

Ankar’s solution is designed for both in-house IP teams and external patent law firms, helping them boost productivity, with customers reporting measurable gains while shifting effort from manual, administrative tasks to higher-value strategic work.

Oracle falls on AI datacenter concerns

Shares of tech giant Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ) fell more than 5% on Wednesday on reports Blue Owl Capital will not back the company’s $10 billion AI datacenter in Michigan, which is expected to be used for OpenAI.

Blue Owl had been in talks with lenders and Oracle over a potential investment in the 1-gigawatt data center project in Saline Township, but those discussions ultimately stalled.

Shares of Oracle have been the poster child for AI datacenter buildout concerns, as investors worry about the amount of capital needed for the projects, their ultimate payback, and the circular nature of the deals.

Fed still has room to cut - Waller

Federal Reserve Governor said Wednesday that the U.S. central bank still has room to cut interest rates amid concerns that the job market has softened.

“I still think we’re probably, you know, maybe we’re 50 to 100 basis points off of neutral,"" which means the Fed still has room to cut interest rates, Waller said at the Yale School of Management CEO Summit in New York.

Given the outlook, ""there’s no rush to get down"" on interest rates, Waller said, and ""we just can steadily, kind of bring the policy rate down towards neutral"" amid what’s likely to be an economy with moderating inflation.

The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points last week, citing a desire to prop up a faltering labor market despite indications of sticky inflationary pressures.

Data this week has pointed to a struggling jobs market, as although grew more than expected in November, this was accompanied by an increase in the jobless rate to a four-year high.

The rise in payrolls was also much smaller than a sharp decline seen in prior months.

Other readings also flagged some cooling in the U.S. economy. Purchasing managers index data for December showed growth in both and was lower than expected, while delayed data for October showed growth cooling from the prior month.

Waller’s comments are of particular interest following a Wall Street Journal report that President Donald Trump is set to interview him for the next Fed Chair. Trump has previously noted that former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett are his top picks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term at the helm of the Fed is scheduled to end in May.

Waller was appointed to the Fed’s board by Trump, but is seen as more of an underdog for the role because he does not have as close a personal relationship with Trump as either Warsh or Hassett, the WSJ reported.

Elsewhere, Lennar (NYSE: ) stock fell after the U.S. homebuilder reported fourth-quarter profit which came up short of expectations, as worries surround the impact of elevated costs on homebuying demand.

Warner Bros Discovery’s (NASDAQ: ) board rejected Paramount Skydance’s (NASDAQ: ) $108.4 billion hostile bid, citing lack of financing assurances.

The decision to recommit to Netflix’s (NASDAQ: ) buyout offer marked the latest twist in the race for assets that include Warner Bros’ storied film and TV studio and its extensive film and television library.

For the seven days following Cyber Week, e-commerce returns were down 0.1%, Adobe reported.
On returns, Adobe found that while shoppers are buying primarily on their mobile phones, they are using their desktops to make returns.
In the 2024 holiday season, one out of every eight returns occurred between December 26 and December 31.
Adobe said its forecast for U.S. ecommerce sales during the holiday months of November and December remains the same.","During the first six weeks of the holiday shopping season, returns of online purchases were down 2.5%, Adobe reported today.

In addition to that potentially positive news for retailers, Adobe also reported that online sales have remained solid following a strong start to the season. E-commerce sales on U.S. retail sites were up 6.1% as of December 12.

For the seven days following Cyber Week, e-commerce returns were down 0.1%, Adobe reported.

The early numbers on returns could support a trend researchers and shopper surveys have been spotlighting since early fall - that consumers are being more deliberate and more informed about their purchases, and that AI is helping them do that.

“Consumers are being very strategic, considered and conscientious about what they buy within the broader macroeconomic environment,” Vivek Pandya, Director, Adobe Digital Insights said.

Pandya noted that consumers ""are using AI tools to determine the best items to select for their holiday shopping, and given this elevated level of consideration we're seeing incrementally lower rates of return than observed in previous years.”

Adobe previously reported that AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites was up 760% in November, compared to the previous November. AI chat services and browsers were used most frequently by shoppers looking for video games, appliances, electronics, toys, and personal care products.

Adobe’s numbers are based on Adobe Analytics data culled from over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, covering 100 million products and 18 product categories.

On returns, Adobe found that while shoppers are buying primarily on their mobile phones, they are using their desktops to make returns. While 52.4% of overall online spending was done on a mobile device, only 39.1% of returns happened on a mobile device rather than a desktop.

Based on past patterns, Adobe is expecting the last week in December to be the busiest time for returns. In the 2024 holiday season, one out of every eight returns occurred between December 26 and December 31. Returns are also expected to be elevated through the first two weeks of January.

Online shoppers also are continuing to use BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) flexible payment plans to cover record amounts of spending, according to Adobe. During the first six weeks of the holiday season BNPL plans were used for $13.9 billion in online spending, up 6% over last year.

Adobe said its forecast for U.S. ecommerce sales during the holiday months of November and December remains the same. It is expecting $253.4 billion in online spending, up 5.3% over holiday 2024.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/69431d8397d3edf3c651b5bc/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-17 19:07:02.421351

The idea behind BenchmarkCards is to give developers a clearer picture of what a benchmark actually tests and where its limits are. Each card includes five sections covering the benchmark’s purpose, data sources, evaluation method, possible risks, and ethical or legal considerations. This makes it easier to compare benchmarks side by side and choose the right one for a specific task. For example, a company trying to reduce harmful content might choose a toxicity-focused benchmark, while a researcher studying fairness would select a bias-focused one.

The researchers hope that this shared format becomes a common language across the AI community. To speed things up, the team also built an automated workflow that can create a benchmark card in about 10 minutes instead of several hours. Indeed, the system pulls information from research papers, converts it into readable text, extracts key details using AI, and then checks those details for accuracy using fact‑verification tools.

NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz's decision ‌to ​tap Steve Cahillane - the dealmaker who steered ‌Kellogg through one of the packaged food industry's biggest breakups - signals the ketchup maker may be ​positioning itself for major asset sales as it pushes ahead with its own split, according to bankers, analysts and a former executive.

Kraft Heinz announced the ‍CEO change while in the midst of ​separating its more than 200 brands into two companies. Shares of the Jell-O maker, among the worst performers in packaged food, are down ​19% this year, ⁠versus a rise of almost 3% in the broader S&P 500 Consumer Staples index.

Former Kellogg CEO Cahillane, appointed to run Kraft Heinz on Tuesday, oversaw the separation of the Corn Flakes and Pringles maker about two years ago, which later saw privately-held Mars scooping up the faster-growing snacks division, Kellanova, at a 33% premium.

With Cahillane on board, Kraft Heinz may be hoping to woo a suitor for ‌its sauces and condiments business, which is expected to have higher margins than its grocery division, according to analysts.

""It's clear ​they're signaling ‌to the market and potential ‍buyers that they're in play,"" ⁠said Bill Johnson, the CEO of H.J. Heinz until 2013, when it was taken private by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil-based 3G Capital. ""We have someone who knows how to do these deals.

""It's (also) an acknowledgement the management team needed upgrading. In case they can't sell the company, they need someone who can operate it better than it's been operated,"" Johnson added.

SHOPPERS CUT BACK

Sales of packaged food in the United States have faltered as shoppers cut back due to sky-high prices, and try newer brands with less processing, hurting Kraft Heinz and its rivals like Conagra.

Kraft Heinz, created in ​a 2015 megadeal, however, has particularly struggled with well-worn brands like Crystal Light drinks, Lunchables meal kits and Kraft Mayo.

Cahillane will also lead Kraft Heinz's condiments and spreads business, which includes Heinz ketchup and Philadelphia cream cheese, after the split, set to be finalized at the end of 2026.

That division is expected to command a higher multiple than Kraft Heinz's overall because of the higher margins, exposure to international markets and potential faster growth. Kraft Heinz's multiple lags peers including General Mills , Mondelez and Conagra.

This year ushered in a crop of major deals for consumer-facing companies like Kraft Heinz, which have faced blowback from shoppers on high prices and wrestled with increasing costs from tariffs.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is also smoothing the path for deal-making, in contrast to his predecessor former President Joe Biden.

Huggies diaper maker Kimberly Clark ​announced plans to acquire Kenvue, which markets pain reliever Tylenol, for nearly $50 billion last month. European confectioner Ferrero bought Kellogg's smaller cereal unit, W.K. Kellogg, for $3.1 billion earlier this year, another success for Cahillane.

To be sure, Max Gumport, a senior analyst at BNP Paribas, said in a research note that he struggles to see logical buyers for Kraft Heinz's business after ​the split.

Kraft Heinz failed to sell Oscar Mayer last year. It also attempted to sell coffee brand Maxwell House.

Council Member Shaun Abreu, who sponsored the legislation, said the suit amounts to retaliation against workers.
We won’t stand by while the apps retaliate against workers who organized for a minimum wage,” Abreu said in a statement.
“Over 80,000 delivery workers at the core of our food delivery ecosystem take on dangerous conditions using their own personal equipment to bring meals to our doors.
Uber and DoorDash have also sued the city repeatedly in recent years over minimum wage increases.","Uber and DoorDash are suing New York City over its Tipping Law, which requires them to offer customers the option to tip at least 10% at checkout — not after an order is paid — claiming that the law exacerbates the city’s affordability crisis and violates the companies’ right to free speech.

“The city compels [Uber and Doordash] to advocate for and implicitly endorse the city’s preferred message — i.e., that New York City customers should tip delivery workers, that they should do so before those workers complete the delivery, and that 10% is an appropriate amount,” the companies allege in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. “The Tipping Law unlawfully compels [them] to convey and endorse a message in New York City that they do not communicate now and would not otherwise communicate.”

The Tipping Law was passed in July and takes effect next month. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who sponsored the legislation, said the suit amounts to retaliation against workers.

“Our goal is to protect workers who perform a difficult, valuable service. We won’t stand by while the apps retaliate against workers who organized for a minimum wage,” Abreu said in a statement. “Over 80,000 delivery workers at the core of our food delivery ecosystem take on dangerous conditions using their own personal equipment to bring meals to our doors. If a customer wants to reward that work with a tip, the apps shouldn’t make it harder for them to do so.”

A DoorDash spokesperson accused the City Council of “pressuring customers” to tip and “turning tipping into an added tax,” and said the lawsuit was about “fighting rising costs and ensuring delivery remains fast and affordable for all New Yorkers.”

A spokesperson for Uber did not immediately respond when asked for comment.

The companies argue that the law“constitutes a regulatory taking” of their property rights by controlling how they communicate with customers and that, because they’ve increased delivery fees after laws raising the minimum wage for their workers to $21.44/hour passed, prompting customers to tip before a delivery will “materially impair [their] goodwill, customer demand, business opportunities, and revenue,” because of increased costs to using their platforms and “growing customer tip fatigue.”

The city’s Law Department, which reviews lawsuits against the city, said it is reviewing the suit.

The city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection called the suit disappointing, accusing the companies of wanting to hide the option to tip, take away consumer choice and punish workers.

“We are disappointed that, once again, Uber and DoorDash are attempting to limit app-based delivery workers’ right to fair and dignified compensation — now, by seeking to restrict consumers’ ability and choice to decide how and when to tip,” the department said in a statement. “Tipping has always been voluntary, but hiding the option in the app or adding hurdles to the process takes that choice away from consumers and punishes workers by lowering their overall potential earnings.”

Their suit is one of the latest clashes between tech platforms and the New York City government over regulations aimed at increasing worker and consumer protections. Earlier this month, Instacart filed a suit to challenge Local Law 124, which increases the minimum wage for grocery delivery workers to $21.44/hour and requires the company to pay workers for time they spend “on call,” not just time they physically spend delivering groceries. Uber and DoorDash have also sued the city repeatedly in recent years over minimum wage increases.

Additionally, in October of this year, the city sued a slew of big tech companies, including Meta, Google, Snap and ByteDance, arguing that their platforms — Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube and TikTok — are fueling a youth mental health crisis. It argues that in “deliberately” trying to maximize youth engagement, it caused young people to become addicted to the platforms and are therefore liable to pay for counseling and other resources in schools to address the issues they’ve caused. The suit is currently in the pre-trial phase.",https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1856636909.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-12-17 18:04:38.894111

""Glen and his team have been central to Delta's premium strategy, as we evolved over two decades to become the airline of choice for travelers who want to invest in great experiences in the air and on the ground,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in a note to employees. ""I could not have asked for a better co-pilot to help lead Delta in becoming the best performing airline in the world.""

Delta is promoting Joe Esposito, who has been at Delta for 35 years — most recently as senior vice president of network planning, pricing and revenue management — to executive vice president and chief commercial officer.

Hauenstein, 64, has been with Delta since 2005 and was named to his current role in 2016. He was previously executive vice president and chief revenue officer at the airline. He will become a strategic advisor until the end of 2026.

During his tenure, Hauenstein grew Delta's international network and helped the airline identify new ways to earn more per seat, in part by successfully getting customers to pay for first-class seats it used to give away for free. In October, Delta said that premium-travel revenue would overtake sales from main cabin next year.

At times, Delta's strategies proved successful with too many customers. Overcrowding in its Sky Club airport lounges prompted the airline to raise the entry bar to get rid of unsightly lines.

""Glen has played a significant role in Delta's transformation since its [2005] bankruptcy filing,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel-industry consulting firm. Hauenstein pushed for the now-industry standard to move the loyalty program to reward spending and not just miles flown and encouraged Delta to invest in better pricing and revenue software, he said.

Harteveldt added that Delta must also figure out when it will upgrade its cabin interiors and make sure it's not alienating customers, some of whom have complained about high redemption rates for frequent flyer miles.

While Delta continues to generate more profit than other carriers, competitors like United Airlines have been investing heavily in revamped cabins, complimentary fast Wi-Fi and new planes. American Airlines , which had been late to the luxury travel boom, is also investing in better products on board and at the airport.

Along with leaning into affluent consumers, Hauenstein had also noted a trend of wealthy baby boomers who were willing to travel.

""Being a baby boomer, I can say this without fear of retribution. There's only so much time to go to Europe or almost so much time to go see Australia or Japan,"" he said on an earnings call in April. ""And so you've got this wealth effect where this cohort of retirees is wealthier than any other cohort even with the most recent rundown, and they want to go do things.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108243221-1766003032115-gettyimages-2245813826-DELTA_CENTENNIAL_NYSE.jpeg?v=1766003103&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-17 17:07:02.702227

NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) – Kraft Heinz’s decision to tap Steve Cahillane – the dealmaker who steered Kellogg through one of the packaged food industry’s biggest breakups – signals the ketchup maker may be positioning itself for major asset sales as it pushes ahead ‍with its own split, according to bankers, analysts and a former executive.

Kraft Heinz announced the CEO change while in the midst of separating its more than 200 brands into two companies. Shares of the Jell-O maker, among the worst performers in packaged food, are down 19% this year, versus a rise of almost 3% in the broader S&P 500 Consumer Staples index.

Former Kellogg CEO Cahillane, appointed to run Kraft Heinz on Tuesday, oversaw the separation of the Corn Flakes and Pringles ‌maker about two years ago, which later saw privately-held Mars scooping up the ‌faster-growing snacks division, Kellanova, at a 33% premium.

With Cahillane on board, Kraft Heinz may be hoping to woo a suitor for its sauces and condiments business, which is expected to have higher margins than its grocery division, according to analysts.

“It’s clear they’re signaling to the market and potential buyers that they’re in play,” said Bill Johnson, the CEO of ​H.J. Heinz until 2013, when it was taken private by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil-based 3G Capital. “We have someone who knows how to do these deals.

“It’s (also) an acknowledgement the management team needed upgrading. In ‍case they can’t sell the company, they need someone who can ​operate it better than it’s been operated,” Johnson added.

SHOPPERS CUT BACK

Sales of packaged food ​in the United States have faltered as shoppers cut back due to sky-high prices, and try newer brands with ‍less processing, hurting Kraft Heinz and its rivals like Conagra.

Kraft Heinz, created in a 2015 megadeal, however, has particularly struggled with well-worn brands like Crystal Light drinks, Lunchables meal kits and Kraft Mayo.

Cahillane will also lead Kraft Heinz’s condiments and spreads business, which includes Heinz ketchup and Philadelphia cream cheese, after the split, set to be finalized at the end of 2026.

That division is expected to command a higher multiple than Kraft ‍Heinz’s overall because of the higher margins, exposure to international markets and potential faster growth. Kraft Heinz’s multiple lags peers including General Mills , Mondelez and Conagra.

This year ushered in a crop of major deals for consumer-facing companies like Kraft ‍Heinz, which have faced blowback from ‍shoppers on high prices and wrestled with increasing costs from tariffs.

The administration of ​U.S. President Donald Trump is also smoothing the path for deal-making, in contrast ​to his ⁠predecessor former President Joe Biden.

Huggies diaper maker Kimberly Clark announced plans to acquire ‌Kenvue, which markets pain reliever Tylenol, for nearly $50 billion last month. European confectioner Ferrero bought Kellogg’s smaller cereal unit, W.K. Kellogg, for $3.1 billion earlier this year, another success for Cahillane.

To be sure, Max Gumport, a senior analyst at BNP Paribas, said in a research note that he struggles to see logical buyers for Kraft Heinz’s business after the split.

Kraft Heinz failed to sell Oscar Mayer last year. It also attempted to sell coffee brand Maxwell House.

S&P Global announced Tuesday that it has appointed Matt Calderone, finance chief of Booz Allen Hamilton, to serve as CFO of its soon-to-be separated mobility business.

Calderone will begin his new role by March 1, reporting to Bill Eager, president of S&P Global Mobility, an automotive data and analytics business, and CEO-designate of the future standalone company, S&P Global said.

“We are excited to see the new Mobility executive team take shape as the business enters a pivotal next chapter,” S&P Global President and CEO Martina Cheung said in a press release.

Dive Insight:

Booz Allen announced Monday that Calderone had informed the company of his to intention to resign, effective Feb. 1, “for another opportunity outside our industry.” Kristine Martin Anderson, Booz Allen’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, will assume his duties on an interim basis until a permanent replacement is found, the consulting company said in a securities filing.

Calderone is leaving Booz Allen after a long career at the company spanning over two decades, briefly interrupted by a stint as organization and retail practices principal at Boston Consulting Group from 2007 to 2010.

He became CFO of Booz Allen in 2022 after serving in a variety of roles in the corporate office, including chief strategy officer and executive vice president of financial planning and analysis, strategic finance and corporate development.

Prior to his time at BCG, he served for seven years in an executive role at Booz Allen’s global commercial business. There, he focused on large-scale transformation for both government and commercial customers, S&P Global said.

The Tuesday release credited Calderone with shaping “many aspects” of Booz Allen’s financial and strategic transformation during his long career at the company. As chief strategy officer, he developed and rolled out “VoLT,” a growth strategy built around velocity, leadership, and technology, the release said.

He also built and led the company’s corporate development team, guiding more than $1.5 billion in merger-and-acquisition transactions as well as equity investments, divestitures, and joint ventures. Earlier in his career, he designed and executed Booz Allen’s Vision 2020 growth strategy and led the company’s restructuring in 2013, S&P Global noted.

Calderone’s “leadership and public company experience will be essential as we continue building the financial and operational foundation for Mobility as an independent company,” Eager said in the release.

The planned spin-off will allow Mobility more flexibility to pursue near- and long-term growth opportunities, including in used car offerings and expanding both geographically and into adjacent markets, according to an April 29 announcement. S&P Global, meanwhile, will remain focused on providing credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow services, the company said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_WBwzFeD1Qq_sRXMCTJGmGR9q32wiSwWon_2AMdI9vw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTU4NDg0MTM3XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-17 16:04:43.863009

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

Market Update

As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.

Robert Bosch, LLC v. Westport Fuel Systems Canada, Inc., No. 2:23-cv-00038 (E.D. Tex.), Dkt. No. 38 (Payne, J.)

On November 6, 2025, Judge Payne denied Robert Bosch’s motion to compel Westport Fuel Systems Canada to substantively respond to an interrogatory concerning obviousness-type double patenting (OTDP). Specifically, the interrogatory concerned Westport's factual and legal bases for contending that the asserted patent was not invalid for OTDP.

In response to the motion, Westport countered that Bosch never properly pleaded OTDP. Westport pointed to Bosch’s answer, which asserted only statutory invalidity grounds “under one or more sections of Title 35.” Beyond this ""perfunctory, single-sentence"" reference to solely statutory invalidity theories, id. at 2, Bosch otherwise failed to identify where it had timely notified Westport of its OTDP theory.

Given Bosch's failure, Judge Payne agreed with Westport that Bosch’s OTDP theory was untimely. The court noted that Bosch’s pleading contained a single sentence listing statutory invalidity provisions but “nowhere . . . state[d], or even hint[ed], that any non-statutory invalidity bases are asserted.” Id. at 2. Because OTDP is a “judicially-created doctrine,” not a statutory § 101 defense, the court held that Bosch’s answer could not reasonably be read to include it. Id. (citing Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 F.3d 955, 967 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).

The court was also unpersuaded by Bosch’s alternative argument — that Bosch lacked a basis to raise OTDP until after claim construction. According to Judge Payne, Westport’s infringement contentions were enough to put Bosch on notice years earlier, and raising OTDP for the first time in a supplemental damages interrogatory response — after the amended-pleadings deadline, after fact discovery, and with expert reports imminent — constituted undue delay. With OTDP not properly in the case, the motion to compel was denied as moot.

PLS IV, LLC v. GDC Technology Limited, No. 2:24-cv-00466 (E.D. Tex.), Dkt. No. 62 (Gilstrap, J.)

On November 24, 2025, Judge Gilstrap issued a claim construction order resolving four disputes across two digital security-related patents. In its order, the court applied an exception to a lesser-known claim construction rule involving ""whereby"" clauses. Specifically, the court considered whether the disputed claim's “whereby” clause limits the scope of the method. The method involves generating and transmitting an ""encoded block of data"" to a ""user's system,""

whereby the user’s system is able to receive and authenticate portions of the encoded block of data before the entire encoded block of data is received

Id. at 4–5 (quoting U.S. Patent No. 7,340,602 at Cl. 25). The parties disagreed over whether this whereby clause should be treated merely as an intended result of the method steps (i.e., the general rule for whereby clauses) or as a substantive claim limitation (i.e., an exception to the general rule).

Judge Gilstrap applied the exception, holding that the clause is limiting. Relying on Hoffer v. Microsoft Corp., 405 F.3d 1326, 1329–30 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court explained that while “‘whereby’ clauses often recite intended results, they cannot be disregarded when they supply a condition material to the invention.” The court went on to explain that here, “the clause ‘clearly describes a capability of the user’s system,’ and the applicant chose to pair the encoding method with a transmission step and a receiving system that must have the specified ability.”

Gatekeeper Solutions, Inc. v. Darktrace, Inc., No. 4:24-cv-00723 (E.D. Tex.), Dkt. No. 39 (Jordan, J.)

We now transfer from Marshall to Sherman, but we may not be there long. This November, Judge Jordan granted Darktrace’s motion to transfer Gatekeeper Solutions’ email security patent case to the Northern District of California. Applying Fifth Circuit § 1404(a) principles, the court held that Darktrace had demonstrated that the Northern District of California is “clearly the more convenient venue” for this action, finding that no factors weighed against transfer.

Gatekeeper, a New York company, accuses Darktrace's email protection feature of patent infringement. This email protection feature prevents users from sending messages to conflicting recipients. Darktrace, headquartered in San Francisco, supported its motion with uncontroverted evidence that all of its ""likely witnesses"" work in or near San Francisco, none are located in the Eastern District of Texas, and the accused product’s technical documentation resides on servers in Darktrace’s San Francisco and Cambridge, UK, offices.

Gatekeeper had some evidentiary hooks at its disposal. Darktrace maintained a small sales office in Plano at the time the lawsuit was filed, though that office closed by the time of the court's decision. Moreover, even though two dozen of Darktrace's clients were located in the transferee district, it did have a customer in the Eastern District of Texas.

But these small hooks were insufficient to warrant keeping the case. Judge Jordan found that most of the private interest factors favored transfer or were neutral.

The first factor — access to proof — favored California because of Darktrace's uncontested testimony that all relevant technical documents are stored on servers in San Francisco and none in the Eastern District of Texas.

The second factor — the availability of compulsory process — likewise favored transfer. Nearly two dozen Darktrace customers who use the accused product and former employees (i.e., ""potential"" third-party witnesses) are located in the Northern District of California, compared to only one customer in the Eastern District of Texas. The court even considered the fact that current employees may leave before trial as favoring transfer.

The third factor — cost for willing witnesses — favored California because all putative willing witnesses resided there, while Gatekeeper identified none in Texas.

For the public interest factors, the court found that the local interest factor also tilted westward, with the remaining factors being neutral.

Though the court concluded that the congestion factor was neutral, it noted that the Sherman Division faces an unusually high caseload. Indeed, despite its finding of neutrality, the court spent a page discussing district-wide statistics and their inconclusive nature, all while suggesting that the Eastern District of Texas is, in fact, quite congested.

The local interest factor weighed decisively in favor of transfer. Darktrace is headquartered in San Francisco, relevant witnesses and documents are located there, and several of the accused acts occurred in that district. By contrast, neither party resides in the Eastern District and Darktrace has no remaining presence there.

The parties agreed that the remaining public-interest factors were neutral.

Finding four factors favoring transfer and none weighing against it, the court concluded that Darktrace met its burden to show that the Northern District of California is “clearly more convenient.""",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15561_3622.png,N,,2025-12-17 15:02:16.414467

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

dfcu Bank has taken a major step in its digital transformation journey by signing a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with global technology leader IBM and IBM Platinum Partner Envision Global.

The MoU was signed at dfcu Bank Head Offices in Nakasero, Kampala, and formalises a long-term strategic partnership aimed at strengthening the bank’s digital infrastructure and transforming how it connects with customers, partners, and the whole financial ecosystem.

The agreement focuses on developing and deploying an enterprise-grade software integration platform called the API Gateway.

This platform will allow dfcu to securely and efficiently connect its internal systems with external partners, enabling faster collaboration, product co-creation, and innovation across various sectors, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, education, and other industries.

“The partnership is a critical pillar of the bank’s ongoing transformation journey, which is aimed at improving customer experience and ensuring long-term competitiveness. Additionally, upgrading core systems is essential to making the bank future-ready and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of its customers,” Charles Mudiwa dfcu Bank Chief Executive Officer, said.

He explained that today’s customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of service, convenience, and reliability, driven by rapid technological change.

To that effect, dfcu is focused on enabling customers to access modern banking services seamlessly, allowing them to bank wherever they are and whenever they want, without unnecessary barriers.

“The main purpose of the API Gateway is system integration, acting as a bridge that allows seamless communication between the bank and its partners. Through this platform, customers of both the bank and partner institutions will be able to access each other’s products and services, enhancing reach and value for all stakeholders,” Musa Musazi, Chief Technology, Digital & Operations Officer at dfcu, said.

They followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook.","When the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.

Jensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.

“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.

But his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.

Starmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.

Not done, Huang called to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.

This week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn ChatGPT maker, Open AI, hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.

He was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.

They followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that, but said he was paid “extremely well”.

Meanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.

TBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.

The Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”

Jobs with the biggest US AI companies could be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also required comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing, as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.

Selling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.

Britain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.

The revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield, the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco startup incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f3e143004db91eb604503fa3c2704aef40f751/1796_74_2930_2344/master/2930.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1330bbc1f14518b03f398a7c2514ab85",N,,2025-12-17 14:03:40.918656

Ambros furthers a tear of investments from RA Capital, which, according to data compiled by BioPharma Dive, was the most prolific venture capital firm in biotech over the past four years.
Since 2022, RA Capital has participated in 85 funding rounds, including more than a dozen this year.","A young drug company has raised $125 million to get a medicine used for a rare kind of chronic pain approved in the U.S.

Officially launched on Tuesday, Ambros Therapeutics was co-founded by biotechnology entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The startup’s main asset is a new “bisphosphonate,” a type of drug that prevents bone loss. Research indicates these compounds also possess anti-inflammatory properties and can act as pain relievers.

Ambros’ medicine, called neridronate, was discovered, developed, and commercialized by another company, Abiogen Pharma, for the Italian market. There, it’s already approved to treat a couple of bone diseases as well as an uncommon disorder known as “complex regional pain syndrome Type I.”

In that latter condition, patients who’ve undergone surgery or suffered an injury, such as a broken bone or sprain, subsequently experience a disproportionate amount of pain from the initial trauma. The pain is persistent, and can feel like extreme burning, throbbing, stabbing or squeezing.

Ambros bought from Abiogen exclusive rights to neridronate in North America. Now, with its new Series A funding, the startup aims to begin in the first three months of next year a late-stage study that could serve as the foundation for an approval filing with the Food and Drug Administration.

In addition to financing that study, the money will be used for “related regulatory preparations and pre-commercial activities,” Ambros said in a statement. The FDA has already granted neridronate a few designations that could speed its regulatory review and give it commercial benefits. Ambros said an estimated 65,000 new cases of CRPS-1 occur annually in the U.S.

RA Capital Management and an arm of Patient Square Capital co-led the round. They were joined by Abiogen Pharma and more than half a dozen other investors.

“Neridronate is one of the few late-stage programs with a well-established mechanism, extensive real-world experience, and the potential to meaningfully change the trajectory of CRPS-1,” said Matthew Hammond, an RA Capital partner, in that statement.

Ambros furthers a tear of investments from RA Capital, which, according to data compiled by BioPharma Dive, was the most prolific venture capital firm in biotech over the past four years. Since 2022, RA Capital has participated in 85 funding rounds, including more than a dozen this year.

Ambros’ haul also comes at a time when pain research — long considered too risky a proposition for most life sciences backers — is drawing more interest, in good part because of the recent approval of a non-opioid pain medication from Vertex Pharmaceuticals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Q8dHTPNVdfKEShMzywzN1ZZ0u7VnhJ6ZlucQOISYAC0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTgxNjMyMDM3X1RzOVRoTGguanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-17 14:03:09.483530

There are already businesses winning the AI race, whether they make hardware, operate cloud platforms, or run the large language models that have become so popular among consumers.

But other industries are starting to embrace AI instead of fighting it, showcasing how seriously executive teams are taking this new technology to bolster their competitive positions.

In fact, a prominent streaming giant just decided to partner with a top AI company in a move that could impact the media and entertainment sector. Investors should take notice.

The House of Mouse is leaning into AI

It was announced on Dec. 11 that Walt Disney (DIS 0.89%) entered a three-year partnership with OpenAI, licensing more than 200 characters (including Mickey Mouse, characters from Inside Out and Frozen, and Marvel superheroes) for photo generation on ChatGPT and video generation on Sora by those apps' user bases. Disney can show these user-generated videos on Disney+, its streaming platform.

What's more, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI. And it will become a customer, integrating OpenAI's technology across its organization in various ways for its employees and to help create new products for customers.

This is clear evidence that Disney is leaning into AI, at a time when those in Hollywood worry about the tech's impact on content creation.

""Disney and OpenAI affirm a shared commitment to responsible use of AI that protects the safety of users and the rights of creators,"" the press release reads.

This is an encouraging statement for those in the industry, but it will be interesting to see how much appetite there is for watching AI-created videos from viewers.

Disney benefits because it can potentially earn incremental revenue by leveraging its intellectual property in this new way. While it's not known if the business will make money from its characters' use on ChatGPT or Sora prompts, it can drive more engagement on Disney+ if this type of short-form content catches on. Disney could better compete with Meta Platforms' Reels on Facebook and Instagram and Alphabet's YouTube Shorts. There is intense competition for attention.

And it gives Disney a first-mover advantage. Perhaps if AI-generated videos go viral, investors could see similar moves by Netflix, for example.

One obvious critique of this decision might be that Disney is selling out and diluting the value of its intellectual property, making its famous characters available to the masses. With ChatGPT counting 800 million weekly users (as of early November), however, this is a good example of a media and entertainment powerhouse attempting to stay ahead of the curve.

This partnership highlights just how valuable Disney's intellectual property is. With characters, storylines, and franchises that span Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, no company can go toe-to-toe with this depth and breadth of content. It makes sense that OpenAI would want to sign a deal with an industry leader. This also suggests there has been significant demand from ChatGPT and Sora users to be more creative and work with Disney characters rather than other studios' intellectual property.

From an investment point of view, those looking to put capital to work in the streaming industry might want to consider Disney. It has become a leader in the streaming wars, with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN providing a full range of content for an entire household.

Alpha Bank Cyprus on Wednesday said that 2025 marked a milestone year that reshaped its position in the local market.

This follows the completion of the transfer of most banking activities of the former AstroBank after securing all supervisory approvals, a move aimed at strengthening its scale and ability to support the Cypriot economy.

The bank described the transaction as a “strategic joining of forces that significantly enhances its market presence and creates a new growth dynamic for its operations in Cyprus”.

As a result of the acquisition, Alpha Bank Cyprus has become the country’s third-largest bank, with total assets exceeding €6.6 billion, a loan portfolio of more than €2 billion and deposits above €5.6 billion.

The expanded scale is expected to support increased investment in technology, innovation and human capital, while reinforcing stability, efficiency and the overall customer experience.

The bank said that it is “building an organisation with meaningful size, a solid capital base and a clear strategy, capable of consistently supporting sustainable economic growth and delivering high-quality services to both individuals and businesses”.

A key priority, the bank said, is the “full utilisation of the combined expertise and experience of Alpha Bank and the former AstroBank teams”.

This will involve “a strong focus on corporate and business banking, as well as private and digital banking, an area that continues to evolve rapidly and requires continuous investment in innovation”.

At the same time, Alpha Bank Cyprus stated that it is “stepping up its focus on sustainable finance and green transition solutions, linking the future of banking with responsibility towards society and the environment”.

“Customer service excellence remains central to its strategy, with the bank aiming to deliver products and services aligned with real market needs, including financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, green investment solutions, housing and consumer products on favourable terms, and specialised services for emerging sectors such as technology and energy,” Alpha Bank Cyprus said.

The bank also said that the “digital transformation is at the core of its strategy“, with investments in artificial intelligence, data analytics and automation “designed to simplify processes, reduce servicing costs and create added value for customers”.

“Through the adoption of modern technologies, the bank aims to enhance transaction security, improve response times and offer greater convenience and transparency in the management of banking affairs,” the bank added.

Operational efficiency was described as “a strategic foundation”, supported by continuous improvements in internal processes, stronger risk management and “the promotion of a culture of accountability to safeguard long-term sustainability“.

Moreover, Alpha Bank Cyprus said that “customer needs guide every initiative, with the design of integrated customer journeys that combine innovation, security and ease of use to make banking as simple and immediate as possible”.

The bank also stated that International Banking Services and the Wealth and Institutional Banking division are playing a growing role in the expansion of operations.

These aim to “support entrepreneurs establishing companies in Cyprus, businesses financing trade and operational flows, and investors managing cross-border transactions”.

“The Wealth and Institutional Banking segment targets high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, offering specialised products and comprehensive solutions in wealth management, investment planning and advisory services,” the bank said.

“By leveraging the international expertise of the Alpha Bank Group and the complementary portfolio of the former AstroBank, Alpha Bank Cyprus provides advanced investment options with transparency and high quality, strengthening long-term trust-based relationships,” it added.

What is more, the Alpha Bank Group described Cyprus as a mature yet dynamic market with strong prospects, citing its strategic location between Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, a developed business ecosystem and a high-quality talent base.

The acquisition of most of the former AstroBank’s banking activities aligns with the group’s strategy to develop regional growth hubs in Greece, Cyprus, England and Luxembourg, creating a unified and modern European banking ecosystem.

“Through the transaction, the group said it has strengthened its capital base and reaffirmed its long-term commitment to regional markets,” the bank said.

The group is also transferring private banking expertise to Cyprus, following international recognition such as the Best Private Bank in Greece award at the Global Private Banking Awards 2025.

Alpha Bank said its strategic cooperation with UniCredit further enhances capabilities, expanding access to European products, services and expertise.

“Cyprus is expected to play an upgraded role as a financial hub, facilitating capital and investment flows and creating new business opportunities,” the bank said, with Alpha Bank Cyprus “aiming to be at the forefront” of this regional connectivity.

Looking ahead, the bank said geopolitical and energy uncertainty is likely to affect tourism, trade and investment, with Cyprus remaining vulnerable due to its size.

The expected normalisation of interest rates is set to put pressure on profitability, increasing the need for revenue diversification and more efficient operating models.

Stricter regulatory and ESG requirements will also demand sustained investment in expertise.

“In this environment, partnerships, outward orientation and consolidation are becoming increasingly important,” the bank said.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/alpha-bank-cyprus-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 14:04:06.261296

For creators and enterprises experimenting with AI video tools, the biggest challenge has rarely been generation; it has been control. Adobe’s latest Firefly updates indicate the company is now squarely addressing that gap.

With new precision editing tools, expanded partner models, and a limited-time offer of unlimited generations, Adobe is positioning Firefly less as a novelty engine and more as a production-ready layer within modern creative workflows.

Announced on December 17, Adobe’s updates focus on a simple but consequential idea: creators should not have to start over every time AI gets something slightly wrong.

Moving Beyond “Regenerate Everything”

Anyone who has experimented with AI-generated video is familiar with the trade-off: accept small imperfections or regenerate an entire clip and lose what worked. Firefly’s new Prompt to Edit controls aim to change that equation.

Instead of regenerating full videos, creators can now make targeted changes to existing clips using text instructions powered by Runway’s Aleph model. A misplaced object, an unwanted background element, or a subtle lighting issue can be corrected without discarding the original output.

This approach reflects a shift in how Adobe views generative AI, not as a one-shot generator, but as an editable medium that fits into iterative creative processes. For teams producing marketing videos, social content, or brand storytelling at scale, that distinction matters.

Camera Motion Becomes Part of the Prompt

Beyond static edits, Adobe is also extending control to camera movement. With the Firefly Video Model, creators can now upload a reference video to guide camera motion while anchoring the scene to a chosen start frame.

The result is closer to directed cinematography than random motion generation. For use cases such as product videos, explainer content, or brand narratives, this could reduce the trial-and-error cycles that often slow AI-assisted production.

Taken together, text-based edits and motion referencing suggest Adobe is prioritising predictability and repeatability, two attributes enterprises typically demand before adopting creative AI at scale.

Upscaling as a Workflow, Not a Separate Tool

Generative AI does not stop at creation; it often exposes quality gaps when assets move across platforms. Adobe’s integration of Topaz Astra into Firefly Boards addresses a practical issue: low-resolution or legacy footage that does not meet today’s distribution standards.

With Topaz Astra, creators can upscale footage to 1080p or 4K directly within Firefly Boards while continuing other tasks. This parallel processing model reflects how creative teams actually work, especially in agencies or marketing departments managing multiple assets simultaneously.

Rather than positioning upscaling as a standalone enhancement, Adobe is embedding it into the broader content assembly process.

Expanding the Model Ecosystem

Adobe is also widening the choice of image models available within Firefly. The addition of FLUX.2 from Black Forest Labs introduces a model optimised for photorealism, advanced text rendering, and multi-reference support.

By continuing to support both Adobe-built and partner models across Firefly and Creative Cloud tools, Adobe appears to be betting that flexibility, not exclusivity, will define the next phase of creative AI adoption.

Firefly Video Editor Enters Public Beta

The public beta of the Firefly video editor marks another step toward consolidation. Designed as a browser-based assembly space, the editor allows creators to combine AI-generated clips, live footage, music, and audio into finished stories.

Users can work either through a traditional timeline or by editing text transcripts, a feature that aligns well with interview-driven content and talking-head videos. Exports support multiple formats, from vertical social videos to widescreen outputs that integrate with traditional editing pipelines.

For Adobe, this positions Firefly not just as a generator, but as a connective layer between ideation and final delivery.

Adobe’s limited-time offer of unlimited image and video generations for eligible Firefly plans until January 15 is more than a promotional lever. It lowers the cost of experimentation at a moment when creators are still learning how to direct AI effectively.

Unlimited access encourages iteration, refinement, and exploration behaviours that ultimately lead to better outputs and deeper product adoption. It also reinforces Adobe’s emphasis on commercially safe models, a key consideration for enterprise users.

What stands out in this update cycle is not a single feature, but a pattern. Adobe is aligning Firefly with real-world creative constraints: precision, quality, collaboration, and workflow continuity.

As generative AI moves from early experimentation to everyday production, tools that respect how creators actually work may matter more than raw generation speed. Adobe’s latest Firefly updates suggest the company understands that transition—and is building accordingly.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/ciol/media/media_files/2025/12/17/image-2025-12-17-16-40-57.png,N,,2025-12-17 16:03:48.338249

Cahill will continue to lead the board’s Separation Committee, which has overseen planning and execution of the breakup since earlier this year. Patricio will remain on the board but step away from the chair role.

The board also said it will launch a global search for a CEO to lead North American Grocery Co., the second business created through the separation.

What the Separation Means for Kraft Heinz

The company expects the separation to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals, tax opinions, and final board approval. The company intends the transaction to be tax-free for shareholders.

Management said the move will reduce operational complexity and allow each company to allocate capital and resources more precisely. Global Taste Elevation Co. will focus on faster-growing and international brands, while North American Grocery Co. will concentrate on core U.S. and Canadian grocery staples.

With Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane taking charge, the company signals continuity in strategy rather than disruption. His track record suggests a focus on disciplined execution, brand investment, and portfolio clarity.

As Kraft Heinz enters its post-merger era, the leadership change underscores a broader reset aimed at restoring growth and relevance in an increasingly competitive food industry.",https://abasto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kraft-Heinz-CEO-Steve-Cahillane-CEO-de-Kraft-Heinz-Steve-Cahillane.webp,N,,2025-12-17 12:05:15.465882

About Delta’s Team USA Partnership

Delta’s history with the Olympic and Paralympic Movement dates to 1996 when Delta sponsored the centennial Olympic and Paralympic Games in its hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. Six years later, the airline served as the Official Airline Sponsor of the Olympic Winter Games Salt Lake City 2002 — another important hub for the airline. Partnering with the Salt Lake City 2002 Games Organizing Committee, Delta also served as the Official Charter Flight Provider of the 2002 Olympic Torch Relay. In 2020, Delta announced a multi-year partnership as the Official Airline of Team USA on the road to the Olympic and Paralympic Games Beijing 2022, Paris 2024, Milano Cortina 2026 and the LA28 Games, where Delta is proud to bring the Games back to the U.S. and one of our most important hubs as a founding partner of the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

While investor sentiment has soured on American recently, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have had their shares climbing. In short, American posted a loss, while Delta and United delivered solid profits.

While United is introducing new routes for 2026, Delta is adopting customer-centric policies, becoming the only U.S. carrier to enforce a popular AI-related ban on flight attendants. American Airlines had to act fast.

By leaning heavily into luxury cabins, elevated lounges, and a more polished onboard experience, American Airlines is betting that passengers will open their wallets for comfort, and the premium edge will bring it back into the race.

American Airlines Aims To Beat United And Delta Air Lines After Years Of Losing Passengers' Favor

Executives are calling it a ""customer reimagination"""", a clean break from years of cost-cutting and volume focus. American Airlines is betting on premium products and loyalty perks, such as long-haul privacy suites, upgraded regional cabins, and enhanced credit card benefits.

""We think investing in customer experience will help us grow the top line,"" said Nat Piper, American Airlines' newly appointed Chief Commercial Officer, in an interview with Reuters.

American's premium push hinges on the Boeing 787-9 and the Airbus A321XLR, using the new jets to launch fresh routes and tap higher-yield, premium-focused demand.

Chief Strategy Officer Steve Johnson described the overhaul as the airline’s most sweeping in decades, forecasting a meaningful revenue uplift beginning in 2026.

""As these changes that we're making are introduced and have some time to gel, you're going to see them deliver value to us,"" Johnson told Reuters.

The Boeing 787-9, outfitted with 51 lie-flat seats and privacy doors, has become American Airlines' most profitable widebody, now deployed on highly competitive transatlantic routes like Chicago–London. In this market, United Airlines has traditionally been strong.

On Thursday, American Airlines will introduce the Airbus A321XLR on the New York–Los Angeles route, one of the country’s fiercest battlegrounds and a corridor where Delta Air Lines maintains a strong foothold. Later, it will be deployed on secondary transatlantic routes such as Edinburgh, using its fuel efficiency to profitably serve thinner markets.

American Airlines Premium Features on its Boeing and Airbus ​​Aircraft

With expanded seating, new lie-flat suites, and Premium Economy on its Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321XLR jets, American Airlines is doubling down on premium travel.

The carrier aims to attract high-yield passengers with enhanced experiences, including upgraded dining, Wi-Fi, and lounge access, while competing head-to-head with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.

Challenges That American Airlines Will Face In The New Strategy

American Airlines CEO Robert Isom blames higher costs from new labor agreements and overexposure to a sluggish U.S. domestic market for American's underperformance.

Supply-chain issues have also delayed deliveries, including the Airbus A321XLR, and slowed upgrades of older Boeing 777 jets due to shortages of cabin components.

Operational reliability remains a weak spot: American Airlines still trails Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in on-time performance and ranks near the bottom in the latest J.D. Power satisfaction survey.

Beyond the operational challenges, investors have turned bearish, sending American's stock price down this year, while Delta and United shares have risen.

American Airlines Stock Price — 6% down

Delta Air Lines Stock Price — 20% up

United Airlines Stock Price — 18% up

CEO Robert Isom acknowledged the challenge ahead, saying American must deliver for its employees, customers and shareholders, according to an audio recording reviewed by Reuters.

""If we don’t make money doing it, it’s not going to be a pursuit that I get to do very long, or any of you do either,"" he said.

Analysts warn that American Airlines’ turnaround will be slow and expensive.

In summary, after years of cost-cutting and volume-focused operations, American Airlines is shifting gears to prioritize premium offerings and loyalty incentives, including long-haul privacy suites, updated regional cabins, and enhanced credit card rewards.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/american-airlines-boeing-777-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-17 12:05:03.740664

Timothy Noah, First Person Viva Hammer",,,,,https://newrepublic.com/article/204525/artificial-intelligence-consumers-data-dynamic-pricing,"Turns out, AI is also spying on your shopping habits and using that information not only to sell you more things, but at a higher price.
This has all been illustrated by a string of reports on how companies are using AI to target consumers.
But sometimes companies are deploying AI to actually trick you into paying even more for things.
It’s hard to set a shopping budget if you can’t be sure what your grocery staples will cost on any given week.
They’re also weary of the second-order effects of building up AI, like the toll of data centers on their communities.","As if it’s not bad enough that artificial intelligence is coming for your job—or at least making it worse—and the data centers fueling it are raising your utility bills and destroying your environment. Turns out, AI is also spying on your shopping habits and using that information not only to sell you more things, but at a higher price.

This has all been illustrated by a string of reports on how companies are using AI to target consumers. The reports make clear that while Big Tech has pushed AI on Americans as a tool to make their lives easier, the technology may in fact be making their lives even harder. This is what happens when any large, concentrated industry is allowed to grow unregulated, and all signs suggest it will get much worse.

In October, the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator published research showing that companies use loyalty programs to hook consumers, creating a captive audience they can track. Because consumers opt into these programs in the hopes of discounts and rewards, the programs are exempt from many state and federal laws about surveillance. And some companies eagerly abuse that legal opening.

Of course, loyalty programs pre-date AI, not to mention the internet itself. But gone are the punch cards of yore. The Vanderbilt report’s lead example is the McDonald’s Monopoly game promotion, which has been around for decades but has now gone digital. Let’s say you win a food item on a peel-off token; to redeem it, you have to use the restaurant’s app, and that requires forfeiting one’s privacy:

To be eligible for these prizes, customers must agree to be tracked on far more than their Big Mac purchases. McDonald’s nearly 10,000-word privacy policy notes how the company can monitor customers’ precise geolocation, browsing history, app interactions, and social media activity. The company then uses this data to train its artificial intelligence models and build profiles on its customers—predicting their “preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, or aptitudes.” McDonald’s leverages these psychological profiles to drive repeat customer engagement over time.

If McDonald’s succeeds in its goal of reaching 250 active loyalty users by 2027, the report adds, the company “will hold psychological and behavioral profiles on a quarter of a billion consumers—a scale rivaling that of a national intelligence agency.”

The central goal here, at least as far as we know, is to drive more McDonald’s sales—both on an individual level and across its entire customer base—by harvesting data. That’s bad enough. But sometimes companies are deploying AI to actually trick you into paying even more for things.

Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports, and More Perfect Union collaborated on an investigation released this month showing that Instacart, the grocery shopping and delivery app, used AI-enabled data collection to manipulate and change prices. The investigators sent 437 shoppers out in four cities and placed items in their Instacart shopping carts at the same time. The results showed that almost three-quarters of the items had prices that varied, and prices for the same items could vary as much as 23 percent. These variations are often invisible to consumers.

Dynamic pricing has long been used by airlines to shift prices as demand changes, and it’s been adapted to consumer goods at online retailers, like Ticketmaster. But AI has turbocharged the practice, making it easier to target price changes to specific customers based on geolocation and IP data, in an attempt to maximize the amount a customer will pay. Customers are largely ignorant of this fact—because companies are loath to disclose it prominently—and in some cases may not have much choice. Many families use apps like Instacart for the convenience; they may not have the time or ability to physically shop in a store themselves. But now we know what they’re paying for this convenience: The Instacart report estimates that the hidden pricing differences could amount to as much as $1,200 a year for some customers.

It’s hard to set a shopping budget if you can’t be sure what your grocery staples will cost on any given week. In other words—trigger alert, President Trump!—it’s an affordability issue. Representative Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat, has introduced legislation to regulate how companies can use AI to set prices and wages, but it’s unlikely to go anywhere in this Republican-led government. In fact, Trump issued an executive order this month promising to investigate and withhold federal funds from states that pass “cumbersome” AI regulations.

Some states have promised to push for new regulations regardless. That’s what Americans want: Half of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI, and 61 percent want more control over how it is used in their lives. They’re also weary of the second-order effects of building up AI, like the toll of data centers on their communities.

But reform-minded politicians are playing catchup while the AI bubble continues to balloon, enriching a handful of companies that are propping up an otherwise ho-hum stock market. Meanwhile, Americans who want to be treated fairly as consumers find themselves getting a bad deal. They can’t shop for Cheerios or a plane ticket for the holidays without wondering just how severely they’re being screwed by AI-trained algorithms. A reckoning is coming. The bubble will probably burst, and Americans’ retirement savings will plummet. But whom will they blame for the damage? The wise policies of the future depend on naming the right villains today.",https://images.newrepublic.com/3470d1f1f85bb0c685f0f4ae7b90bc6cf0597e9a.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:03:32.654805

In this way, STELAH moves toward its goal: making green hydrogen a more sustainable and competitive alternative. The consortium aims to accelerate the market arrival of highly efficient, scalable electrolyzers, essential to reducing costs and contributing to the decarbonization of industries and long-distance transport.

The joint work focuses on developing and validating high-performance electrodes—both anodes and cathodes—along with optimized stacks capable of delivering superior performance compared to currently available alkaline electrolysis technologies.

Milestone Achieved: Higher-Performance, Sustainable, and Scalable Materials

The Matteco team has developed new advanced combinations of catalytic materials for anode and cathode composition, characterized and validated by the University of Valencia.

These new formulations, which avoid the use of scarce and critical materials such as platinum derivatives, exhibit greater electrochemical activity and improved stability—essential factors for continuous electrolysis in industrial operating environments. In addition, they have been scaled to the size planned for this phase of the project.

Meanwhile, the teams from Técnicas Reunidas and AIJU have evaluated the electrodes with different substrates in a precursor stack setup. The results have been satisfactory: they confirm the feasibility of the new material combinations under representative operating conditions and their scaling potential.

These results pave the way for the next milestone: integrating the optimized materials into cell prototypes and modular stacks at the final planned size.

By dialing up the intensity level within the company, OpenAI is following a playbook occasionally used by Silicon Valley tech companies during times of heightened competitive threats.
Google declared its own code red after OpenAI’s ChatGPT came on the scene a few years ago.
By December of 2023, Google, armed with a newly-christened Gemini large language model, was matching OpenAI’s ChatGPT on a series of benchmarks.
The next code red OpenAI’s past code reds have been called to deal with threats ranging from China’s DeepSeek to Anthropic’s Claude.","Fast-forward just one year to this December when employees got a decidedly different holiday present: a five-alarm “code red” laid out in a memo from CEO Sam Altman, bracing the team for “rough vibes” and economic headwinds in the wake of increased competition, and trying to light a fire under them to refocus over the coming weeks.

As part of the missive, Altman announced a temporary postponement of many of the initiatives that had promised to get OpenAI closer to its stated financial goal of breaking even by 2030. That includes delaying several major revenue generators that the company was counting on: advertising, an expanded e-commerce offering, and (to a lesser extent) agentic systems.

The company is not in a life-threatening crisis. ChatGPT topped Apple’s App Store charts as the most downloaded free app in the U.S. in 2025, and just last week, OpenAI announced a groundbreaking partnership with Walt Disney Co. that will bring the media company’s characters to OpenAI products (along with a $1 billion investment). But the code red alert reveals a real concern within OpenAI that the $500 billion company could lose its position as the standard-bearer and pacesetter for generative AI technology.

The data backs that up. While ChatGPT still holds a big lead with more than 800 million weekly users, Google’s Gemini is gaining fast: In its Q3 earnings, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced that its Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users, up from 450 million in July. Preliminary November data from SimilarWeb reveals Google Gemini generated 1.351 billion website visits—a 14.3% increase from October. Meanwhile, ChatGPT fell below the 6 billion benchmark it had touched in October, recording 5.844 billion visits and marking its second month-over-month decline in 2025.

In the lucrative market for enterprise customers, OpenAI appears to have lost significant market share, falling to 27% according to one recent report by Menlo Ventures, while Gemini has risen to 21% and rival startup Anthropic leads at 40%. (OpenAI disputes the figures from Menlo, noting that the venture capital firm is an investor in Anthropic; it notes that more than 1 million business customers now use OpenAI tools, with sharp upticks in usage metrics over the past year. The company also just released a survey of its enterprise users that showed enterprise usage of OpenAI’s models more than doubling over the past year in many countries outside the U.S.)

As one former OpenAI researcher told Fortune, the situation is serious. “It’s pretty remarkable that Sam is so open about it…this is one of those few moments where he’s very transparent about the threat that OpenAI is receiving from Google.” As this person sees it, “If Google overtakes OpenAI in raw performance, it’s basically going to kill OpenAI’s API business…There’s a chance Google is going to give out Gemini for free entirely, too. And that could kill the consumer subscription business for OpenAI as well.”

The internal call to arms lays bare the very precarious position this market leader is now in, particularly as it confronts industry titans like Google (as well as Microsoft and Meta), with tens of billions of dollars in cash on their balance sheets and massive ecosystems of products to boost their distribution.

For Altman, a longtime tech entrepreneur, the historic matchups of Silicon Valley’s past, pitting innovators and incumbents in winner-takes-all battles, are surely contributing to the sense of urgency: The annihilation of browser pioneer Netscape by Microsoft or the eclipse of BlackBerry’s handheld communications gadgets by Apple’s iPhone comes to mind. But there’s also the example set by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose famous “lockdowns” over a decade ago helped repel the threat of Google’s nascent—and ultimately doomed—social networking product.

The decisions made by OpenAI and its competitors at this critical juncture in a fast-moving market will decide which company cements its hold on what some have called the most transformative technology since electricity, and which will end up as odd footnotes in the final writing of the history of AI.

Demis versus Sam

Altman views new competitive threats like a “pandemic” that must be fought immediately and forcefully before any competitor gets too much traction, according to someone recently briefed on OpenAI’s thinking. “You just don’t let any competitor get oxygen,” Altman has said.

OpenAI unleashed the first element of its counterattack in mid-December, with the release of GPT-5.2, internally code-named Garlic. The model puts OpenAI back on top of many closely watched benchmarks for AI performance. Then on December 16, OpenAI launched a new image generation model designed to show it can match the buzz created by Google’s Nano Banana.

But even the company acknowledges that these are merely initial moves in what needs to be a much broader effort to regain momentum. The code red will last eight weeks—a time frame the company says is longer than its previous such exercises because of the holidays. The plan is to “exit” the code red in late January with the release of a second big product update. During this time some of its recent initiatives will be put on the back burner so that OpenAI can concentrate on shoring up its core ChatGPT product and the AI models that underpin it.

“The code red is to really signal to the company that we want to marshal resources in one particular area, and that’s a way to really define priorities and define things that can be deprioritized,” OpenAI’s CEO of applications Fidji Simo said on a call with reporters last week to announce GPT-5.2. Simo said that GPT-5.2 had been in the works for months and that the timing of its release last week was not directly related to the code red, but she said the launch was helped by the additional resources and focus of the alert.

One OpenAI employee who works on ChatGPT and its coding products describes the mood inside the company as focused but not panicked. “We were starting to get distracted before with all the other things we had going on, and this is going to get the whole company to focus a bit more on the core product. For us working on ChatGPT, it’s good.” And while OpenAI employees recognize that Gemini 3 is a good model, the person said they were not worried about a sudden mass defection of developers from OpenAI to Google.

By dialing up the intensity level within the company, OpenAI is following a playbook occasionally used by Silicon Valley tech companies during times of heightened competitive threats. Facebook’s lockdowns were an extreme example, with employees putting their personal lives on hold to buckle in for marathon work sessions accompanied by posters with printed Roman battle cries and the glare of a large neon “lockdown” sign.

Google declared its own code red after OpenAI’s ChatGPT came on the scene a few years ago. Since then, Google has reoriented the company to win the AI wars. Sergey Brin, Google’s billionaire cofounder who stepped back from day-to-day involvement in 2019, is back full-time, pitching in on some of the technical work and exhorting staffers to push themselves harder and to work longer hours, according to media reports.

And Demis Hassabis, the now Nobel Laureate (for his work on AI science breakthrough AlphaFold) and former child chess prodigy, is at the center of Google’s efforts. He’s been at Google since 2014 when he sold his startup to the tech giant; in 2023 he was put in charge of Google’s merged AI divisions: DeepMind and Google Brain. With a team of thousands under his command, Hassabis has redoubled the company’s efforts on large language models, OpenAI’s stronghold. By December of 2023, Google, armed with a newly-christened Gemini large language model, was matching OpenAI’s ChatGPT on a series of benchmarks. But when that model was fully released to the public in early 2024, its strong performance on many tasks was eclipsed by an embarrassing debacle over its image-generation capabilities. (In an effort to try to make the model less likely to produce toxic images, it actually made the model politically correct to the point of ridiculousness, depicting black Vikings and Nazis for instance). That misstep, along with the “glue as a good pizza topping” advice that Gemini gave later that spring, made a lot of people question whether Google really had gotten its mojo back. But in the past year, it has shown it can produce models that are as capable, if not more capable, than those created by OpenAI.

As one tech entrepreneur mused to Fortune about Google and OpenAI, “Look, in some ways this is Demis vs. Sam [Altman], and if we’re honest, who do you believe in more here? Sam may be ruthless but long term is he really a match for Demis?”

Gemini rising

When Allie K. Miller, an AI advisor and investor, recently attended a Shark Tank–type event hosted by Mark Cuban, she was struck by what happened when Cuban said the words “Nano Banana.” She expected that the mention of Google’s whimsically named AI image generator might cause confusion among the thousands of people in the audience, who Miller described as mostly new to AI. Instead, the crowd nodded in recognition.

Like ChatGPT itself, she explained, “there are certain AI tools or models that you just start hearing over and over and over again that gain such a big pop culture moment.”

Google initially released Nano Banana in August, but it was the new Nano Banana Pro, which came out in late November, that has turned heads within the tech world and the general public. Hyper-realistic AI images of famous actors in movie scenes that never existed and tons of AI-generated memes filled social media feeds, eliciting expressions of wonder—the kind of adoration OpenAI had become accustomed to basking in. Nano Banana Pro was especially proficient at generating images with readable and context-appropriate text in the image, something that previous image generators couldn’t do reliably. This made the model good for creating PowerPoint slides and info graphics.

What may have truly spooked Altman, however, was the performance of Gemini 3, the newest version of Google’s flagship AI model (and the model powering Nano Banana Pro). From the impressive answers it delivers to complex business questions, to its writing and coding capabilities, Gemini 3 very quickly earned plaudits from influential AI users and the general public.

Google said that it achieved Gemini 3’s performance gains from both pre-training (the initial process of building an AI model in which it is fed tremendous amounts of data and simply taught to predict the next word in a sequence) as well as through post-training, in which a model’s outputs are shaped through different learning processes to exhibit certain qualities, such as being helpful and friendly. This surprised many AI industry insiders, since the conventional wisdom had been that any advantages from pre-training had largely been exhausted.

Worse for Altman, there were also rumors that many of OpenAI’s large pre-training runs in 2025 have failed to produce models that were any better than prior ones. If this is the case, it could be one of the major causes of anxiety within OpenAI because it implies that there’s some formula for success and model improvement that the company is not currently able to replicate. (When OpenAI released its newest GPT-5.2 model this past week, it said little about how it trained the AI. But it did say that it had found ways to optimize “all phases of training.”)

Because the performance of its models has long offered one of its primary defensive moats, OpenAI can’t afford to fall behind the competition for long. And as Altman and company endeavor to add features that match its rivals’ other strengths, the company needs a best-in-class AI model as its foundation.

That’s especially true when it comes to its battle with Google, which has nine products each boasting more than 1 billion users, including Gmail, Chrome, and YouTube.

“People are shifting over to Gemini not just because it’s got a better model, but they’re realizing that this capability is baked into everything,” says Ajay Agrawal, a researcher on the economics of AI. Just matching Gemini now won’t cut it—OpenAI will have to be measurably better, or bake what they’re doing into some workflows just to keep up. Says Agrawal, “It’s hard to imagine now that they’ll be able to just keep going with just a language model as a general tool.”

In the enterprise market, OpenAI needs to stop Anthropic’s gains in the sector and convince more businesses that ChatGPT is the best choice to meet their specialized security and privacy needs.

Enterprise customers are critical to OpenAI’s future, says Futurum Research CEO Daniel Newman, because the most substantial revenue opportunity is not in users paying for individual subscriptions for ChatGPT but in businesses applying AI to their vast pools of internal data and “consuming trillions of tokens daily.” It’s the “great unlock” that will allow OpenAI to finance its huge computing costs.

The importance of enterprise to OpenAI was underscored last week when COO Brad Lightcap spoke at a Fortune event. “I wake up every day and think about enterprise,” said Lightcap. “We have not yet really captured that moment of enterprise AI penetration,” he said, referring to the broader AI industry.

The company’s latest survey of its enterprise users shows that its existing customers are rapidly scaling up, with usage of OpenAI’s models among technology companies growing 11x year-over-year, while the figures for the healthcare sector are 8x and for manufacturing 7x, respectively. But the report does not break down either total customer numbers or the monetary value of these accounts.

The next code red

OpenAI’s past code reds have been called to deal with threats ranging from China’s DeepSeek to Anthropic’s Claude. But with 3,200 employees, the company is now larger than ever, and the former nonprofit’s mission has evolved, driven by the increasing pressures of building a sustainable business. And the extent of Altman’s ambitions means there will be more code reds ahead.

Looking beyond the next eight weeks, OpenAI is on a collision course with another consumer giant: Apple.

Altman has made no secret about how important he believes new types of hardware devices will be in the way that people use AI, and he has set an ambitious goal of creating an OpenAI gadget that replaces the smartphone as the standard gadget people carry around. In May he hired former Apple design guru Jony Ive and acquired Ive’s startup, with the goal of producing this new generation of AI gadgets. Speculation about those new devices ranges from glasses to a wearable pendant-like gadget.

While Altman has expressed mixed opinions about glasses as a form factor, he has spoken about innovations in 3D technology that, while still years away from being commercially viable, could eventually make glasses an ideal AI gadget. In the near term, Altman is optimistic about screen-based devices and audio interfaces, according to the source briefed on his thinking.

“We are all living in the constraints of this same kind of computer that we have been using for a long time, and that feels totally wrong and limiting,” Altman said at a conference in November, alongside Ive. “We don’t know how to figure out the right answer, but we think the world deserves better stuff.”

The first version of OpenAI’s hardware devices will be available in less than two years, Ive said at the event. For its part, Apple—like Google—is certain to ramp up its own efforts after being initially caught flat-footed by OpenAI.

As this battle rages, it will also be fought with perception: Which company do consumers trust? Which one do you want to own your data and get to “know” you? There, it’s not yet clear that there is a winner. But perception is a funny thing—and can change quickly. Just a few years back, Google was widely perceived to be a tech behemoth with too much power. Then OpenAI came along. As one Twitter user wryly noted of Altman’s AI company: “They somehow made Google look like the underdog good guys that everyone cheers for.”

The financing structure for CEE RF9 is unique for alternative investment funds which belongs to CEE Group, an asset manager specialized in renewable energies and part of the Canadian Brookfield Asset Management Group. The financing supports a diverse portfolio of 45 wind and solar projects located across Germany and France. In addition to providing lending capacity, ING acted as Original Issuing Bank, while UniCredit served as Facility and Security Agent, Hedge Coordinator and Account Bank.

CEE RF9 will repower at least 29 projects with state-of-the-art wind turbines and photovoltaic modules. As a result, the installed capacity of the overall portfolio will increase from the current 457 MW(p) to approximately 1.1 GW(p), which corresponds to an expansion of more than 140%.

This transaction marks a milestone in the German renewables market, as it enables the consolidation of investment fund financing at the portfolio level for the first time and does not require additional equity from existing investors. The cashflows generated by operating assets serve as a substitute for equity and set new standards for institutional renewable energy investments.

""This landmark transaction demonstrates the continued appetite of international lenders to support innovative renewable energy solutions in Europe, having advised on this unique portfolio financing structure to accelerate the expansion and repowering strategy of renewable energy projects will make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy sector and the achievement of climate goals"" said White & Case partner Florian Degenhardt who led the Firm's deal team.

CEE RF9 was launched at the turn of 2024/2025 as the latest generation of the successful ""CEE Renewables Fund/RF"" product series. The fund transferred existing portfolios consisting of 45 European PV and onshore wind assets from previous CEE RF funds to the new platform, with the aim of extensive repowering by 2030.

Listen HERE.

The album features original artwork by Shepard Fairey, with 100% of net proceeds benefiting Los Angeles wildfire recovery and housing relief initiatives. It is available nationally at Urban Outfitters on unique orange translucent vinyl.

“Home is where the heart is. Our home is LA, and our hearts were shattered by the devastation of this year’s horrific fires in Altadena, Malibu, and Pacific Palisades,” said the FLOOD editorial team. “So many of our friends, neighbors, and comrades in the music and arts communities were impacted, and are still working toward a path to recovery. This record is both a tribute and a tangible contribution to those rebuilding their lives.”

Highlights include Elliott Smith’s alternate version of “Angeles,” Norah Jones’ achingly beautiful rendition of “God Only Knows,” ”Rilo Kiley’s ode to LA “Let Me Back In,” a “freestyle remix” of “Cadavre Exquis” from Chino Moreno of Deftones’ ††† (Crosses) project, Local Natives performing “Lemon” in singer Taylor Rice’s backyard overlooking Altadena, and The Flaming Lips’ psychedelic take on “Good Vibrations.”

Several contributors were personally affected by the fires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of Dawes lost their homes and studio in Altadena, while Poolside’s Jeffrey Paradise lost his home in Pacific Palisades. Dawes’ “Time Spent in Los Angeles (for Altadena)”—recorded with Andrew Bird and Alan Hampton—and Poolside’s “Pull Together” with Satin Jackets both appear on the LP.

Jeffrey Paradise from Pooliside revealed, ""The fire has been one of the hardest times for me. But the support from the community and friends has been one of the best things that’s ever happened to me. It’s an interesting dichotomy. Hard to think that we’re somehow almost a full year on and still picking up the pieces, though. That doesn’t get talked about as much. It’s why this LP is so important one year on. It underscores that the recovery effort is still going and will keep going.”

Taylor Griffin from Dawes stated, ""It’s my belief that music can be healing. Even physically. The right song or the right collection can help pain be contextualized or processed or even moved on from. I love being a part of a release like this that makes healing its primary objective. Not to mention, to help raise a little money for those who need it. ""

Nik Ewing from Local Natives said, “Like many in our community, we performed benefit concerts right after the LA fires. Watching our friends in Dawes at one of those concerts, who just lost everything, perform a stripped-down version of ""Time Spent in Los Angeles"" transform into a melancholic, but hopeful anthem, brought a tear to everyone's eye while also saying ""we got this.""

We performed this version of “Lemon” overlooking Altadena before the fires. We are proud to be among LA legends and others contributing to this beautiful compilation, aiding in the long, long road to recovery and rebuilding from the widespread devastation.

The album culminates with a soul-stirring rendition of Talking Heads’ “Burning Down the House” by Quazar and the Bamboozled, led by Altadena Musicians co-founder Brandon Jay along with support from Rilo Kiley’s Pierre de Reeder, featuring dozens of musicians personally impacted by the fires—transforming the song’s literal “fighting fire with fire” lyrics into an anthem of resilience and renewal.

“I was so glad to be able to contribute to this,” Rilo Kiley’s de Reeder said. “Being able to help Brandon out and host so many fire-affected folks, bringing their talents together for a very cathartic recording of ‘Burning Down The House,’ was very special. Also happy that we were able to contribute a Rilo Kiley track as well.”

All proceeds benefit the Gimme Shelter Collective, FLOOD’s nonprofit initiative supporting artists and communities affected by the wildfires, in partnership with Altadena Musicians, Instrumental Giving, and the California Community Foundation Wildfire Recovery Fund.

Production is supported by Levi Strauss & Co. Each LP is pressed as a sustainable EcoSonic recyclable record and will be available in multiple exclusive color configurations through Urban Outfitters, Amoeba Music, indie retailers,Barnes & Noble, and FLOOD Magazine

With 252 pages in a 12"" x 12"" format, FLOOD’s 10th anniversary edition is the largest issue the team has ever produced, packed with dozens of incredible artists representing the past, present, and future of FLOOD’s editorial spectrum, while also looking back at key moments and events in the magazine’s history.

While they commemorate a decade of FLOOD, they are also celebrating 25 years of Gorillaz with a career-spanning cover interview with Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett on their visionary project, along with insights from De La Soul and Little Dragon, and 16 pages of images from Gorillaz’ vaults.

On the flip side of this issue’s Gorillaz cover is another act building their own magical universe: Miami-raised, LA-based duo Magdalena Bay. This marks the first of what will undoubtedly be many more magazine covers to come for them.

Throughout these pages, you’ll find reflections on FLOOD’s first 10 years: a decade of dynamic live photographs, their #1 albums from each year, and visual highlights from FLOODfest events, while they also turned the tables and asked 26 artists (including My Morning Jacket, Spoon, Lucy Dacus, Phantogram, Amyl and the Sniffers, Hot Chip, Blondshell, and many more) to write about the albums that moved them most during the FLOOD era so far.

You’ll also find extensive interviews with Mac DeMarco, Lord Huron, Wolf Alice, Automatic, Bootsy Collins, and many more. Plus, Fred Armisen details his Perfect Day in LA, The Zombies’ Colin Blunstone breaks down each track on their classic Odessey and Oracle album, and Nation of Language details their favorite films of the past decade.

The issue also includes dozens of pages showcasing amazing artwork and photography, with features on the evocative photo work of actor Norman Reedus, legendary visual artist Cey Adams, the iconic punk and new wave photography of Michael Grecco, and the story behind Smithsonian artists Rigoberto A. González and Felipe Galindo being targeted by the Trump administration.

“Never before have technology and energy been so intertwined in determining the future course of American innovation, commercial growth, and economic security,” Jason Wells, chairman, president and CEO of CenterPoint, added in the release.

In November, the utility company got the go-ahead from the Public Utility Commission of Texas for a $2.9 billion upgrade of its Houston-area power grid. CenterPoint serves 2.9 million customers in a 12-county territory anchored by Houston.

A month earlier, CenterPoint launched a $65 billion, 10-year capital improvement plan to support rising demand for power across all of its service territories.

OpenAI completed a restructuring in October that was designed to give it more freedom to pursue deals like this to raise capital. Against a backdrop of growing fears that valuations in the AI sector are overheating, OpenAI has forged ahead with a series of deals since then, including a $1 billion injection from Disney along with a licensing agreement allowing the use of its characters on OpenAI’s video app Sora.

The Amazon deal would also reportedly see OpenAI granted the ability to use Amazon's Trainium chip, which would mark a major win for the tech giant's semiconductor business. Nvidia still dominates the AI chip market, but companies such as Meta and Amazon are gaining traction with rival offerings.

It would be the second major agreement between the two companies in recent months. In November, OpenAI agreed to buy $38 billion worth of capacity from Amazon Web Services, which chief executive Sam Altman said would help it expand towards the “massive, reliable compute” needed to scale the company.

OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure commitments in the last few months, including with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. The scale and circular nature of those deals has heightened fears that the AI industry could be operating in an investment bubble.

Those concerns were renewed last week when Oracle's stock fell by as much as 16% following the release of its earnings report, which showed its AI spending far outpacing returns. It shaved as much as $70 billion off the company's valuation.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2244440792.jpg",N,,2025-12-17 11:05:59.877974

Medline manufactures and distributes branded and non-proprietary medical products, such as surgical kits, gloves, protective apparel, and advanced wound care items. The company, which is backed by private equity firms Blackstone (BX), Carlyle (CG), and Hellman & Friedman, anticipated $5.4 billion from the IPO but raised more.

Medline Uses ‘Greenshoe’ to Top IPO Raise

The boost in Medline’s IPO outing was aided by strong investor demand and the issuance of an additional $900 million in shares. This was made possible thanks to the “greenshoe” overallotment option that allowed extra shares to be sold on top of the offering’s base size.

Medline’s performance exceeds Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology’s (CTATF) public debut raise of $5.3 billion in May. It also beats several other closely watched IPOs seen this year, including design software platform Figma’s (FIG) $2.4 billion, crypto exchange Bullish’s (BLSH) $2.1 billion, and buy now, pay later provider Klarna’s (KLAR) $1.9 billion IPO raises.

Medline Overcomes Investors’ Tariff Concerns

The aforementioned private equity firms acquired Medline in 2021 in a $34 billion deal, putting forward a collective $17 billion equity investment. The medical supply and logistics company initially planned to go public during the second quarter of this year, aiming to raise about $5 billion.

However, the firm halted the move as President Donald Trump’s tariff regime rendered financial markets volatile. Yet, Medline’s chart-topping rise suggests that investors see the medical supply company as less exposed to policy changes compared to other firms in the healthcare sector.

This is even as companies such as Figma suffered price crashes following their public debut earlier in the year.

In the first seven months of 2025, stablecoin transaction volumes surpassed $4 trillion, up 83% year-on-year, and now sit alongside traditional networks in terms of scale. Regulators are moving in parallel: the SEC has opened the door to multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, and major custodians such as BNY Mellon, State Street, and DBS are broadening their digital-asset operations.

Yet this market infrastructure's maturity process comes with caveats. Banks, EMIs and payment institutions continue to face rising client demand for digital-asset payments, while few are prepared to build and maintain these systems in-house.

Against this backdrop, B2BINPAY now introduces an expanded White Label Solution that shortens time to market and enables operators to add crypto payments and wallet functionality without long development cycles.

A Shift From Long-Term Development to Ready-Made Deployment

Instead of assembling blockchain teams, managing node operations, onboarding KYT providers, or coordinating multiple chain integrations, institutions can now launch a branded crypto payments and wallet stack based on B2BINPAY's existing infrastructure.

The platform draws on the same operational base that serves over 980 merchants, processes more than $5.1 billion in incoming transactions, and supports 350+ digital assets across 10 blockchains.

Where Institutions Capture Value

The White Label Solution functions both as a technical layer and a business enabler. Institutions can generate revenue through:

Tiered fees on deposits and withdrawals;

Configurable mark-ups on swaps and conversions;

Hedging and risk-management tools that support internal spread capture.

This setup allows banks, EMIs and PSPs to retain ownership of the client relationship and economics while relying on an established provider for the underlying operations.

About B2BINPAY

B2BINPAY is the leading global all-in-one crypto ecosystem for business, offering secure, efficient, and scalable services to integrate cryptocurrency payments seamlessly into operations. The company is headquartered in Rome, Italy. It has 980+ merchants, and it has processed more than $5.1 billion of incoming transactions. The platform supports 10 blockchains for USDT and USDC and more than 350 coins. It follows KYC and KYT principles.

Trump's threat specifies ""all sanctioned oil tankers going into, and out of, Venezuela.""
US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the tanker had been transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.
US oil giant Chevron, for example, was given special licences by the Biden administration in 2022 to resume Venezuelan oil exports.
There are already expectations that the global oil market will face oversupply next year.","Donald Trump's announcement of a ""total and complete blockade"" of sanctioned oil tankers travelling to and from Venezuela has raised questions about the economic consequences for the regime of leftist president Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has made oil a central target in his ongoing campaign against Maduro, which was sparked by the US president's claims that Maduro was to blame for the illegal flow of both migrants and drugs to the US from Venezuela.

The fragile Venezuelan economy is exceptionally dependent on oil. If Trump's blockade threat turns out to be more than just words, it would have significant implications for Caracas.

What exactly has Trump threatened?

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday (Dec. 16), Trump said Venezuela ""is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America"" before saying he was ordering the blockade.

Since late August, the US has been setting up a major naval build-up across the Caribbean Sea — one of the largest US naval deployments in the region since the so-called Cuban missile crisis in 1962.

Up to a dozen US military vessels have been operating in the Caribbean in recent weeks, including aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.

How a blockade will work

A naval blockade is a military operation where warships encircle a specific coastline with a view to prevent maritime traffic from entering or leaving.

Trump's threat specifies ""all sanctioned oil tankers going into, and out of, Venezuela.""

Last week, US forces seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the tanker had been transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. Caracas decried the seizure as an act of ""international piracy.""

If successfully and fully implemented, the naval blockade threatened by Trump would dramatically reduce the amount of oil coming out of Venezuela. However, it is not yet clear exactly which tankers would be affected or precisely how a blockade would be carried out.

As is often the case with Trump's social media pledges, there are also legal doubts. Elena Chachko, an international law scholar from UC Berkeley Law School in the US, told news agency Reuters that a blockade would raise ""serious questions on both the domestic law front and international law front.""

While Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, is heavily sanctioned and many vessels which pick up oil there are specifically sanctioned, others which transport oil from the country are not. US oil giant Chevron, for example, was given special licences by the Biden administration in 2022 to resume Venezuelan oil exports. The idea at the time was that softening Venezuelan sanctions would ease wider oil market pressures in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

But in October this year, the Trump administration gave Chevron fresh authorization to produce oil in Venezuela argueing the US company was a vital partner for Caracas.

How US sanction already hit

Venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil for state income. Crude oil and related products such as petrochemicals account for more than 90% of Venezuela's export revenues. They keep Maduro's heavily sanctioned and isolated government functioning and in power.

Experts say that if there were more cargo seizures, or if Trump were to follow through on the blockade, much of Venezuela's oil would remain in the country, while that which makes its way out would likely be sold at a steep discount.

There is already evidence that the recent seizure of a Venezuelan tanker by US forces and the threat of further measures is having an impact.

According to data analytics firm S&P Global Commodities Insights, the number of oil tankers travelling to Venezuela has fallen sharply over the past few weeks. The London, UK-based firm said in a report on Tuesday that as of the week starting December 14, there were 17 tankers sailing to or around Venezuelan waters. That's down from 24 vessels a month earlier.

The S&P report also noted that several sanctioned vessels currently ""appear to be turning away"" from Venezuelan waters and the broader Caribbean Sea following the US seizure of the tanker and subsequent sanction announcements.

On December 11, the US sanctioned six shipping companies and six tankers which operated regularly in Venezuela's oil sector, with more sanctions likely in the coming weeks.

Could the Venezuelan economy handle the damage?

Given the level of crisis the Venezuelan economy has endured over the past decade, few can predict what fresh depths it could reach without impacting Maduro's grip on power.

The country's oil output has already been in decline in recent years as a result of sanctions, corruption and economic mismanagement. Venezuela has the world's largest deposit of known oil reserves but has increasingly struggled to maximize revenues from it.

During the rule of Maduro's predecessor, late Hugo Chavez, oil prices and revenues soared but they have fallen dramatically for more than a decade. Whereas Caracas once pulled in more than $100 billion (€85.6 billion) a year from oil, the figure is now closer to $20 billion.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Venezuela's economy endured ""the single largest economic collapse for a non-conflict country in almost half a century,"" in the period since Maduro took office in April 2013.

What about global oil markets?

Although oil prices jumped by more than 1% on Wednesday, most analysts say Trump's blockade threat on Venezuelan output has a limited impact on global markets.

""Overall, export volumes from Venezuela are relatively small in the global supply share. With all eyes on the Russia-Ukraine discussions, the market is still under downside risk,"" one oil trader told Reuters.

Muyu Xu, senior oil analyst at Brussles-based data analytics firm Kpler, told Reuters that while Venezuelan oil production accounts for around 1% of global production, ""most of it is concentrated on a small pool of Chinese buyers, and others in the US and Cuba.""

There are already expectations that the global oil market will face oversupply next year.

Saad Rahim, chief economist of commodity-trading giant, Trafigura, told the Financial Times earlier this month that the oil market will face a ""super glut"" as a burst of new supply collides with weakness in the global economy, and weighing on already falling prices for crude oil in 2026.

CRN Asia takes a look at three changes that vendors and partners are making that could impact the channel ecosystem in 2026.
Consolidation of partner programs through acquisitions – There were many major acquisitions announced this year.
New and enhanced partner programs – 2025 saw enhancements to some vendor partner programs as well as the launch of the new ones.
For example, Cisco gave partners more than a year to understand how their new Cisco 360 partner program will work.","2025 may have been a good year for most tech vendors and channel partners in Asia. However, the reality is the year was filled with many uncertainties, especially with the concern of tariffs and supply chains having a huge impact of how partners can plan their business.

While most vendors and partners were able to work their way around all the challenges throughout the year, 2026 is seemingly looking to bring more challenges and uncertainties as well.

CRN Asia takes a look at three changes that vendors and partners are making that could impact the channel ecosystem in 2026.

Consolidation of partner programs through acquisitions – There were many major acquisitions announced this year. The big ones include Palo Alto Networks’ acquisition of CyberArk and IBM’s acquisition of Confluent. There was also the completion of HPE’s acquisition of Juniper Networks. All these acquisitions would eventually lead to the convergence of partner programs. The question now is how will these programs impact partners? While many partners are excited about the opportunities to offer more products and services to customers, some will clearly struggle to cope as well.

New and enhanced partner programs – 2025 saw enhancements to some vendor partner programs as well as the launch of the new ones. The biggest change to partner programs would be VMware Broadcom’s new VMware Cloud Service Provider (VCSP) program that began on Nov. 1 with a slew of changes in store for partners. The other will be the Cisco 360 partner program which goes live in February next year. Google Cloud has also announced plans to launch a new partner program next year that will be more AI-driven to simplify the process for partners. While these new programs have been designed to provide partners with better opportunities and capabilities to reach out to new customers and support existing ones, some partners may still find it difficult to adopt these new programs.

For example, Cisco gave partners more than a year to understand how their new Cisco 360 partner program will work. The vendor also co-designed the program with a lot of feedback from their partners. But even with the workshops and events to share more about the changes to the program, some partners are still finding it harder to adopt the changes.

Rise of value-added distributors and value-added resellers – The days of pure play distributors and resellers are becoming numbered, especially in APAC. Conversations with vendors and partners throughout the year reveal that distributors and resellers are now focused on adding more value to the products they are offering as they realize this would enable them to get more profits. This includes services like consultation which a lot more distributors and resellers are moving into. Advisory and consultancy services are proving to be of greater need especially with organizations wanting to have the best plans and roadmap in their AI and tech journey.

Some distributors are also investing in developing AI use cases with vendors that they can easily provide to customers. These use cases are normally based on common customer challenges and can be adopted to different markets and industries in the region as well, making it simpler for the distribution and enablement of AI in organizations.

These changes and trends are based on conversations that CRN Asia has had with vendors and partners throughout 2025. While there is still time for partners to relook into their strategies and see how they can scale properly, the reality is, partners that have already adopted the changes will definitely have a head start compared to the rest.

What the industry says

At the recent GTDC APJ summit in Singapore, Frank Vitagliano, CEO of GTDC said, ""Distributors have become an even more vital component of IT suppliers' market and sales expansion objectives in recent years, especially in the ultra-competitive cloud, cybersecurity and AI fields that require fast, cost-effective growth. An optimal distribution strategy boosts channel performance and ROI and provides greater incentives for everyone, including current and potential investors.""

Vendors have stated that partners would need to be ready to use AI to enhance their capabilities and be subject matter experts, especially when dealing with customers.

Chetan Krishnamurthy Vice President, Ecosystem and Digital Sales, IBM APAC, stated that speed and scale will be key to growing volume and velocity for IBM partners. This includes the need to automate some processes to make it more seamless for both partners and customers.

Meanwhile, Jacob Pereira, Head of APAC Partnerships at Zoom believes that 2026 will see a new breed of partners rising, especially with the enhancements Zoom has made to its partner program and also the increasing demand from customers to have more products and services.

For Suchanda Mandal, VP of APAC partnerships at Cloudflare, the vendor is on a journey to become 90% partner. Speaking to CRN Australia, Mandal explained that to grow the channel, first, they need to be ready and their partners need to be ready. This includes investing in people and process technology to make it easier for partners to do business with Cloudflare.

Damien Wong, Senior Vice President for Asia Pacific and Japan (JAPAC) stated that while Tricentis does not work 100% through partners, his desired end state is that every customer should have partners that work with them. Wong believes that training and enablement actually help partners address challenges they face. It’s also why Tricentis is very focused on helping ensure partners are well-trained, well-certified, and that they understand that as the portfolio evolves.

Other vendors and partners have also shared their views on the opportunities and challenges that they have experienced and also expecting in the future. At the end of the day, the channel ecosystem will very much be dependent on how both partners and vendors make it seamless to deal with customer demands in 2026.",https://www.crnasia.com/news/2025/partners/media_1a8c4bef3e3ead820c90ff5ded83f043d37bfa564.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-12-17 13:03:27.178212

Holders of Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit and 50,000-credit plans receive unlimited image and video generations in the Firefly app for a limited period.","Adobe has rolled out a series of updates to its Firefly generative AI platform, adding new video editing tools, additional partner models and a browser-based video editor, alongside a promotion that removes generation limits for some subscribers.

The company is introducing a Prompt to Edit feature for video, camera motion controls, a new video upscaling option from Topaz Astra, and access to the FLUX.2 image model from Black Forest Labs. It is also moving Firefly video editor into public beta as a lightweight, web-based assembly tool for AI-generated and traditional footage.

Adobe is pitching Firefly as a single environment for working with multiple generative models at different stages of a creative workflow. The platform sits alongside tools such as Photoshop and Premiere in its wider Creative Cloud portfolio.

Prompt-based video edits

The new Prompt to Edit feature lets users apply natural language instructions to existing AI-generated clips. Creators generate footage inside Firefly, then send it to Runway's Aleph model, which interprets text prompts and makes targeted changes without regenerating the full video.

Adobe highlighted example instructions such as ""Remove the person on the left side of the frame,"" ""Replace the background with a clean studio backdrop,"" and ""Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast."" The model applies those instructions to the chosen clip inside Firefly.

The approach is designed for cases where a generation is close to the desired result and only requires selective refinements. It reduces the need to re-roll whole scenes in search of incremental improvements.

Firefly also adds camera motion controls within the Firefly Video Model. Users upload a start frame image and a separate reference video that contains the desired camera movement. The system then recreates similar motion in a generated sequence, anchored on the supplied frame.

Adobe said the combination of text-based editing and camera-motion references is aimed at preserving strong takes and cutting down on trial-and-error generation cycles for short-form and social content.

Upscaling with Topaz Astra

Adobe is expanding its use of third-party AI models inside Firefly through new integrations. Topaz Astra, from Topaz Labs, is now available in Firefly Boards for video resolution upscaling.

The model can increase output to 1080p or 4K. Users can apply it to low-resolution clips or older footage that lacks definition.

Adobe positions the integration as a way to prepare back-catalogue content for current distribution formats. The company said that while upscaling runs in Boards, creators can continue other tasks or queue additional videos for processing.

On the image side, Firefly now supports FLUX.2, the latest model from Black Forest Labs. FLUX.2 generates and edits images at up to 1 megapixel and handles flexible aspect ratios. It focuses on photorealistic detail and advanced text rendering and can work with up to four reference images.

FLUX.2 is accessible inside Firefly's Text to Image module, Prompt to Edit and Firefly Boards. It is also available in Photoshop's Generative Fill and is scheduled for Adobe Express from January.

Browser-based video editor

Alongside the new models, Adobe is opening Firefly video editor to a broader audience in public beta. The tool runs in the browser and functions as a multi-track editor for assembling AI-generated clips, audio and user-uploaded footage.

Users can work in a traditional timeline view for frame-accurate cuts, pacing and layering. They can also edit by text in workflows such as talking-head or interview videos, where the transcript drives the reordering or trimming of segments.

The editor supports exports in multiple aspect ratios. Adobe is positioning it for vertical social formats as well as widescreen outputs that can sit beside content created in desktop tools.

In a blog outlining the direction for Firefly, Adobe described the editor as the place where separate AI generations, live footage and soundtracks come together into finished pieces.

Unlimited generations offer

Adobe is coupling the product updates with a temporary removal of generation limits across Firefly for some paying customers. Holders of Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit and 50,000-credit plans receive unlimited image and video generations in the Firefly app for a limited period.

The promotion covers Firefly's own commercially safe image and video models and a set of partner models that now includes FLUX.2, Google's Nano Banana and OpenAI's GPT Image, alongside the new Topaz Astra upscaler.

Adobe said that many customers work with several AI systems in parallel and prefer not to move between separate tools for model selection, generation and editing. It is framing Firefly as a central environment for those tasks across still and moving images.

""As model innovation accelerates across the industry, the combination of industry-leading models plus Adobe's best-in-class creative tools is where things become truly transformative-turning AI from 'generation' into a practical, end-to-end creative workflow,"" said Adobe.

The company plans further integrations of external models and deeper links between Firefly, Creative Cloud and Express as it builds out its generative AI ecosystem.",https://itbrief.com.au/uploads/story/2025/12/17/compatible_Firefly_Video_Editor.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:04:03.631139

Who Are Republic Services’ Top Shareholders?

Republic Services’ shareholder base is led by large institutional investors that tend to hold through market cycles, which can help keep long-term ownership stable. Recent filings show a mix of selective accumulation and trimming, suggesting balanced sentiment rather than a strong directional shift, and for investors this points to confidence in the business alongside valuation awareness.

Cascade Investment, L.L.C.: 109,816,832 shares (35.47%), ~$23.6B value. Cut 4,258 shares (-7.97%).

The Vanguard Group, Inc.: 19,006,141 shares (6.14%), ~$4.09B value. Added 47,135 shares (+0.25%).

Pictet Asset Management Ltd.: 4,030,807 shares (1.30%), ~$868M value. Cut 1,275,628 shares (-24.04%).

Hedge Fund Highlights

One notable move came from Tairen Capital, founded by Terry Zhang, which increased its Republic Services position by over 4,000% last quarter. The firm now holds roughly $8.6M value of the stock, which may indicate growing interest in RSG’s defensive cash flow profile following recent share price weakness.

Another increase was seen from Magnetar Financial, led by Alec Litowitz, which boosted its stake by nearly 472% to about $4.2M value. While still modest in size, the sharp change suggests Magnetar may be leaning more positively on Republic Services’ long-term earnings stability.

Gotham Asset Management, run by value-focused investor Joel Greenblatt, raised its position by roughly 41%, bringing its total holding to approximately $36.6M value. The move appears consistent with Gotham’s focus on high-quality businesses with durable margins.

Meanwhile, Scopus Asset Management, founded by Alexander Mitchell, increased its exposure by nearly 39%, now holding about $8.8M value of the stock, and for investors this pattern suggests selective hedge fund interest without signs of crowded positioning.

Republic Services’ Recent Insider Trades

Osborne, who stepped down as a member of parliament in 2017, is to begin his new job next month and will be based in London.

“I recently asked myself the question: what’s the most exciting and promising company in the world right now? The answer I believe is OpenAI,” he said on social media.

‘Democratic values’

OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane said Osborne joining the company reflected a belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure, and that “decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come”.

The OpenAI for Countries programme has so far engaged with governments in more than 50 countries.

Lehane said on social media that the scheme is designed “to ensure that global AI systems are built on democratic values”.

It is an extension of the Stargate programme that was unveiled at the beginning of 2025, and initially focused on building infrastructure such as data centres in the US and expanded to other countries in April.

Osborne is the chair of the British Museum, hosts a podcast and was the editor of the Evening Standard from 2017 to 2020.

He will leave his current role at investment bank Evercore to join OpenAI.

They took the name Ankar for their new company from the name of an omniscient and powerful knight found in pre-Islamic poetry.
The new funding for Ankar comes as intellectual property has become increasingly critical to corporate value.
“Patent claims are basically the scope of protection for your invention—like, what are the most important pieces of my invention that I want to protect?
[Ankar’s] tool can help suggest an initial set of claims and then help the patent attorney think through potential options for broadening these claims,” Gharbi said.","Ankar was founded by Tamar Gomez and Wiem Gharbi in 2024. The pair met while working at Palantir, where they both encountered the time-consuming process of trying to obtain patents for new technology. Gomez, who has a business background, worked as a development strategist for Palantir, while Gharbi, who is a data scientist by training, worked on machine learning applications. They took the name Ankar for their new company from the name of an omniscient and powerful knight found in pre-Islamic poetry.

“We are trying to turn IP that has been viewed as a cost center for a very long time into more of a strategic and competitive asset that we need today in a world that is becoming more and more competitive,” Gharbi, who is Ankar’s chief technology officer, told Fortune.

The new funding for Ankar comes as intellectual property has become increasingly critical to corporate value. Intangible assets like IP now represent up to 90% of the value of S&P 500 companies, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. Yet the systems for protecting those assets remain stubbornly outdated, according to Gomez and Gharbi, who say they witnessed how time-consuming and difficult it is to obtain a patent when they were working at Palantir.

“To go from something that’s in the head of the inventor—an innovation—to something that is a bankable asset that can be leveraged by the company in the form of a patent took years, basically,” Gomez, who is Ankar’s CEO, said. “The tools to do so were incredibly legacy or just non-existent. It was like a hodgepodge of manual processes.”

Patent attorneys can spend weeks searching multiple databases and reading patent filings to try to determine the extent to which, if any, prior patents might conflict with the new invention they were hoping to protect. Then it can take many more weeks to craft a patent application with the right arguments to try to overcome any objections from patent examiners. Securing a patent can take up to 24 months.

Ankar wants to use large language models to streamline that process. Because these models can search for phrasing that has the same meaning, even if it doesn’t use the exact same keywords, they can quickly surface patent filings from databases that previously would have taken multiple searches and hours of reading to discover.

The startup’s invention discovery tool searches across 150 million patent applications and 250 million scientific publications and produces reports assessing how “novel” an invention is and what claims have already been made by previously patented inventions that might be similar (what’s known in the patent world as “prior art.”) The platform helps inventors harvest their ideas and guides patent attorneys through drafting applications, including spotting gaps in existing patents where claims for a new invention might get the most traction. It also supports patent lawyers when they have to respond to possible challenges from patent examiners, giving them a single view of the entire history of the application process.

“Patent claims are basically the scope of protection for your invention—like, what are the most important pieces of my invention that I want to protect? [Ankar’s] tool can help suggest an initial set of claims and then help the patent attorney think through potential options for broadening these claims,” Gharbi said. “So it’s no longer about just helping you kind of generate words, because we think that the value of just generating words is going to decrease over time. It’s going to become more about like, how do I generate the best qualities of the scope of protection?”

The company has secured some notable early customers, including global cosmetics giant L’Oréal and global law firm Vorys. Ankar says that so far its customers have reported an average 40% boost in productivity, with hundreds of hours shifted to high-value strategic work.

Jean-Yves Legendre, competitive IP intelligence manager at L’Oréal, praised Ankar in a statement, saying that the startup “understood patents, spoke our language, and adapted to our needs.”

Many global companies, particularly in automotive, electronics, and R&D-heavy sector are redoubling efforts to protect their intellectual property, concerned that generative AI will make it easier for competitors to replicate product designs, architectures, and processes. At the same time, many companies are eager to record and protect their IP because they want to use it to train or fine-tune their own AI models to help boost productivity.

Ankar plans to use the new funding to double its current 20-person headcount and expand its engineering, product, design, and go-to-market teams across Europe and the U.S.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tamar-Wiem-e1765928471134.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-12-17 05:59:56.663344

The brokerage started Siemens Healthineers at Outperform with a €55 price target, arguing that the stock’s valuation does not reflect its medium-term growth profile or leading market position.

“Trading close to all-time low multiples since the IPO, we believe the valuation is not reflective of the company’s medium-term mid-to-high single-digit sales and double-digit underlying earnings growth potential, nor its no.1 positioning and track record of outperformance in core markets,” analysts led by Natalia Webster wrote.

The company added a further 7 percentage points of market share in Imaging, reinforcing its leading position, and gained 10 percentage points in Radiation Oncology since the pre-Varian acquisition period in 2020, analysts noted.

“We believe it can continue to outperform core markets, supported by scale, new innovations, AI-integration and synergistic offerings to hospital customers,” they added.

RBC estimates around 6% group sales growth rate over the 2026-30 period and expects margin expansion driven by mix, productivity initiatives, and price increases, offsetting near-term headwinds from tariffs, foreign exchange, and China.

The bank also sees potential upside from the Diagnostics division, noting that a sale or further margin improvement could unlock additional value.

Separately, RBC initiated coverage on Koninklijke Philips at Sector Perform with a €25 price target, reflecting a more balanced risk-reward view.

The bank said Philips’ valuation discount versus peers is justified by “lower sales growth potential, lower margins and returns,” as well as ongoing regulatory and execution concerns.

RBC acknowledged progress at Philips following its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts, with the company on track to deliver €2.5 billion in productivity savings over 2023–25.

However, the analysts said recent regulatory warnings underline that “further attention is needed on fixing its quality and safety measures,” particularly in its Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care segments.

The bank forecasts Philips to deliver around 4% constant-exchange-rate sales growth rate over 2025–28, below consensus, alongside gradual margin expansion to 13.5% by 2028 financial year.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning four major retailers about compliance with a recall of infant formula that has been linked to botulism.

Ann Oxenham, the FDA’s top compliance officer for the human foods program, sent letters to Albertsons, Kroger, Target and Walmart Friday about ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula products remaining on some store’s retail shelves as late as Nov. 26.

“These warning letters highlight the critical responsibility that retailers have in effectuating a recall, particularly when dealing with products that pose serious health risks to our most vulnerable populations, such as infants,” the agency said in a statement released Monday.

No infant deaths attributed to the outbreak have been reported. At least 51 cases across 19 states resulted in infant hospitalizations as of Dec. 10, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

ByHeart issued a recall of the formula on Nov. 8. The company expanded the recall three days later to include all of its products, including unexpired formula cans and single-serve “anywhere pack” sticks, according to an agency news release.

When the agency’s state and local partners made 4,000 visits to retail stores in the weeks after the initial recall, they found the formula stocked at more than 175 locations across 36 states.

“Food safety is a shared responsibility, and it is of utmost importance that all parties in the supply chain act swiftly and vigilantly to protect our nation’s children from unsafe food,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement.

Botulism in babies occurs when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum bacteria, according to the CDC. Symptoms can take weeks to develop, but they include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control and difficulty swallowing.

The ByHeart formula products were found at Walmart stores in 21 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 26, according to the FDA warning letter to CEO Doug McMillon.

“As a participant in the supply chain, your firm should take prompt and effective action when notified of a product recall,” Oxenham wrote.

A Walmart spokesperson told States Newsroom that the health and safety of their customers is “always a top priority.”

“When notified of the recall, we moved swiftly to issue a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores and clubs and online. We take all reports of inaction seriously and will respond to the letter,” the spokesperson said.

Even though Target told the FDA that the big-box store put a block on bar codes for cans of ByHeart formula and the single-serve packs on Nov. 11, an investigator found the formula at a New Hampshire location five days later, according to the warning letter.

A larger agency audit discovered the recalled formula was still on Target shelves across 20 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 20. Associates told state and local FDA partners that they were not aware of the recall or confused about the scope of which products were potentially affected by the contamination, among other explanations.

An auditor even found the single-serve formula packs marked down at an Arkansas Target with a $2 discount weeks after the nationwide recall, the letter states.

Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The recalled formula was found at several Albertsons stores, including Acme and Safeway, across 11 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19, according to an FDA letter sent to CEO Susan Morris.

Agency officials had a call with the company’s leadership on Nov. 20 asking for a plan about the issue, but Oxenham wrote that the company did not deliver one.

In a statement provided to States Newsroom, a spokesperson for the company said “they are committed to the health and safety of our customers.”

“We have procedures to address product recalls, including working closely with suppliers and regulators to identify and remove affected items and communicate guidance to customers,” a spokesperson said. “ByHeart infant formula products have been removed from our store shelves.”

The FDA wrote to Kroger interim CEO Ronald Sargent on Friday, too, saying that the formula was found at the company’s stores across 10 states “well after the recall was initiated and subsequently expanded.” Kroger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ByHeart is issuing refunds for all products purchased on or after Aug. 1 from their website, and parents or caregivers can also get their money back if they purchased the formula from retailers, according to a statement.

The company has had safety issues recently: A Pennsylvania plant closed this year after inspectors found mold, dead insects and a leaking roof in a formula production area, The New York Times reported last month.

Two years ago, a hazardous bacterium that can cause sepsis and meningitis in infants was found in a processing area of the same plant and in finished formula shortly after, according to the Times.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/citypulse/original/20250523-131120-699-city_pulse_generic_og_image.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:02:45.925167

The offering attracted nearly 173,000 subscribers, marking the highest number of individual participants ever recorded for an IPO in Morocco and surpassing the previous record held by Maroc Telecom in 2004, which had drawn 133,000 investors during its public offering. The subscription period closed on December 8 with the MAD 5 billion operation oversubscribed by 3,400 percent, generating total demand exceeding MAD 171 billion ($17.1 billion), an astronomical figure that demonstrates the pent-up demand for quality equity issuers in the Moroccan market.

According to the Casablanca Stock Exchange preliminary data, the construction and infrastructure group sold 12 million shares equal to 20 percent of its share capital at a price of 420 dirhams per share, excluding preferential allocations granted to some investor categories. The company scheduled to begin trading on December 16, 2025, with the deal ranking as the second-largest IPO ever completed in Casablanca behind only Maroc Telecom’s 2004 listing, and significantly exceeding the scale of other offerings completed in 2025, including Vicenne and Cash Plus, which had already helped revive activity on the primary market.

The overwhelming subscriber response indicates growing household willingness to invest in equities when company fundamentals appear solid, reflecting a maturation of Morocco’s retail investor base and increased financial literacy among the general population. For SGTM, this listing opens new financial horizons while allowing historical investors to monetize their holdings and institutionalize the company’s shareholder base, transforming what was previously a family-owned enterprise into a publicly accountable corporation subject to enhanced governance standards and disclosure requirements.

Strategic Rationale Behind the Public Listing

SGTM views this IPO as a critical step in its long-term development and opening strategy, designed to position the company for accelerated growth in both domestic and regional markets. By offering part of its capital to the market, the group aims to strengthen its financial structure, attract new strategic and financial partners, improve operational transparency through regular public disclosure, and enhance its visibility both nationally and across the African continent where infrastructure demand continues to surge.

The offering also supports a critical managerial objective: involving employees directly in the company’s performance and enabling them to share in the value created through their collective efforts. This employee participation component reflects modern corporate governance practices that align workforce incentives with long-term shareholder value creation, fostering a culture of ownership and accountability throughout the organization.

The company’s decision to pursue a public listing occurs against a backdrop of extraordinary growth opportunities. SGTM’s backlog has climbed to around MAD 35 billion ($3.5 billion) as of late 2024, almost double its level at year-end, giving SGTM roughly three years of sales “almost secured” at current run-rate. This robust pipeline provides solid visibility on future activity and supports the company’s growth ambitions in Morocco and in several African markets where it maintains operational presence.

Five Decades of Infrastructure Excellence

Founded in 1972 by brothers Ahmed and Mohamed Kabbaj, SGTM has evolved from a challenger in a market dominated by foreign firms into one of the central players of Morocco’s construction and infrastructure industry. The family-owned group, which has remained 100 percent Moroccan and independent throughout its history, has spent over half a century helping shape the country’s physical and economic landscape through completion of more than 1,000 flagship projects.

The company positions itself as a multi-specialist operator active across five main business lines: dams and hydraulic works, tertiary buildings, transport infrastructure and civil works, maritime and river works, and industrial, mining, and energy-related structures. Its impressive track record includes major dams that provide water security for agriculture and urban populations, ports such as Tanger Med and Nador West Med that serve as gateways for international trade, large stadiums that host national and international sporting events, sections of Morocco’s high-speed rail line connecting major cities, industrial units supporting manufacturing sectors, and university campuses that expand educational infrastructure.

As of the end of 2024, the company employs more than 21,000 people across its operations, backed by a sizeable equipment fleet comprising approximately 2,500 machines ranging from earthmoving equipment to specialized construction machinery. This substantial workforce and capital equipment base enables SGTM to simultaneously execute multiple large-scale projects while maintaining quality standards and meeting demanding delivery schedules.

The group’s geographic footprint extends beyond Morocco’s borders, with the company actively operating in six other African countries including Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. This regional diversification reduces dependence on any single market while providing exposure to infrastructure development opportunities across West Africa, where governments are investing heavily in roads, ports, energy facilities, and social infrastructure to support economic development and improve living standards.

Explosive Revenue Growth Driven by Infrastructure Boom

Financially, SGTM enters the public market with impressive scale and a visible growth trajectory that has accelerated dramatically in recent years. Consolidated revenue rose from about MAD 8.8 billion ($880 million) in 2022 to MAD 11.1 billion ($1.11 billion) in 2024, representing growth of approximately 26 percent over the two-year period. More significantly, revenue reached around MAD 11 billion in 2024, up from MAD 8.5 billion in 2023, marking growth of approximately 30 percent in a single year.

For 2025, SGTM anticipates similar robust expansion, with revenue expected to reach close to MAD 14 billion ($1.4 billion), replicating the annual increase of more than 25 percent achieved in 2024. This extraordinary growth trajectory reflects the company’s success in capturing major infrastructure contracts associated with Morocco’s accelerating development programs, particularly those linked to preparation for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2030 FIFA World Cup.

The 2030 World Cup alone is boosting SGTM’s business by approximately 15 percent according to company leadership, though this understates the broader transformational impact on Morocco’s construction sector. As Hicham Kabbaj, a company executive, noted in an interview, “The 2030 World Cup is an accelerator of the infrastructure development in the country,” driving demand across multiple project categories from transportation networks to hospitality facilities.

The company’s most visible World Cup-related project is its role in constructing the Hassan II Stadium, which is being built approximately 35 miles east of Casablanca and will feature a design capacity of 115,000 seats, making it the largest football stadium in the world when completed. In September 2025, the firm completed total renovation of Rabat’s Moulay Abdellah Stadium, demonstrating its capacity to deliver complex projects on aggressive timelines.

World Cup Infrastructure: A National Transformation

Morocco’s successful bid to co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup with Spain and Portugal has unleashed an unprecedented wave of infrastructure investment that creates enormous opportunities for construction companies like SGTM. The country is preparing to invest approximately $5 billion in infrastructure projects specifically tied to World Cup preparation, though this figure represents only the tournament-specific investments and does not capture the full scope of the broader national development program.

The Moroccan government has committed approximately MAD 150 billion ($15 billion) to infrastructure projects across multiple sectors through 2030, with Fouzi Lekjaa, Morocco’s minister in charge of the budget, explaining that the country’s infrastructure projects for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations are being designed as integral components of World Cup preparation, ensuring that every dirham spent provides lasting value beyond the immediate tournament requirements.

The comprehensive development program includes renovating five existing stadiums and investing MAD 5 billion ($500 million) in construction of the world’s largest football stadium in Benslimane near Casablanca. Beyond sports venues, Morocco plans to invest MAD 12.5 billion ($1.3 billion) to develop highway infrastructure, with investments spanning from 2025 to 2032 and focusing on three major projects: the Continental Rabat-Casablanca Highway, Tit Mellil-Berrechid Highway, and Ain Harrouda and Sidi Maarouf junctions.

These highway projects are designed to improve access to the Grand Stadium in Casablanca for the World Cup, ease traffic flow on the Rabat-Casablanca corridor, and improve connectivity across the Casablanca region, addressing longstanding congestion challenges while creating modern transportation infrastructure that will serve the country for decades.

The construction sector represents about 6 percent of Morocco’s GDP and 16 percent of employment, positioning it at the heart of a public investment program exceeding MAD 1,000 billion ($100 billion) through 2031. Large-scale projects in water infrastructure, transport, ports, industrial platforms, renewable energy, and social facilities are already underway or planned, with the World Cup adding an additional layer of urgency and visibility for stadiums and transport upgrades.

Economic impact analyses project substantial returns from these investments. According to Valoris Securities estimates, each World Cup match is projected to contribute between $25 million and $37.5 million to the economy, with total direct economic benefit estimated at $1.2 billion and GDP growth contribution of 0.6 to 0.9 percent during the 2024-2030 period. The tournament is expected to create 200,000 to 250,000 direct and indirect jobs while generating an 80 percent increase in tourist arrivals by 2030.

Valuation Framework and Investment Thesis

The valuation framework adopted for the SGTM IPO centers on discounted cash flow methodology, using a business plan covering 2025-2031 that incorporates projected revenue growth, margin profiles, investment schedules, and working capital requirements. According to detailed analysis, the weighted average cost of capital is set at 7.96 percent, combining a risk-free rate of 2.88 percent, an equity risk premium of 6.07 percent, and an unlevered beta of 0.9, which translates into a cost of equity close to 9.93 percent.

The terminal growth rate is capped at 2.5 percent, positioned conservatively below macroeconomic forecasts for Morocco’s construction sector to provide valuation cushion. On this basis, the discounted cash flow model yields an equity value of MAD 26.692 billion ($2.67 billion), or MAD 445 per share, placing the IPO price of MAD 420 toward the lower end of the theoretical range and providing investors with immediate value appreciation potential.

This valuation of around MAD 25 billion ($2.5 billion) for the entire enterprise reflects SGTM’s position as a family-owned construction group coming to market through an initial public offering made entirely by share disposal from the founding Kabbaj family. The IPO pricing strategy balances the interests of selling shareholders seeking to monetize decades of value creation with the need to attract new investors through attractive entry valuations that leave room for capital appreciation.

The timing of the IPO is directly linked to favorable macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions. Construction activity is accelerating across Morocco, supported by record public investment programs and the momentum generated by World Cup preparation. SGTM’s substantial order book, robust profit margins, conservative balance sheet, and IPO valuation that sits below model-based estimates create a compelling investment proposition for both institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to Morocco’s infrastructure boom.

Casablanca Stock Exchange: A Market Reborn

SGTM’s arrival on the Casablanca Stock Exchange occurs during a particularly active year for the bourse, which is witnessing the return of sizeable listings after several quieter years when capital-raising activity had languished and investor sentiment remained subdued. The exchange has experienced a remarkable transformation, with the benchmark MASI index surpassing the symbolic threshold of 19,000 points and reaching a record MAD 1 trillion ($100 billion) market capitalization for the first time in its history during July 2025.

Before SGTM, Cash Plus had received AMMC approval for its own listing, scheduled for December 8 following a dual operation of new and existing shares totaling 3.8 million units at a fixed price of 200 dirhams, for a global amount of approximately 750 million dirhams ($75 million). The fintech company’s IPO generated MAD 48.82 billion ($4.88 billion) in subscription requests for just MAD 750 million in available shares, representing a 64-fold oversubscription from 80,759 investors across 75 nationalities and 12 regions.

Cash Plus made history as Morocco’s first fintech to list on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, landing a valuation of about $550 million and drawing one of the largest investor turnouts the market has seen from a technology-driven issuer. The listing closed on November 25 after the IPO raised $82.5 million in total, including $44 million in new capital that will go directly into scaling the company through expansion of its nationwide footprint, strengthening its agent network, and pushing its digital ecosystem further into payments, mobile wallets, and app-based services.

Earlier in 2025, Vicenne made a notable market debut on July 15 with an IPO that was oversubscribed 64 times, attracting 32.1 billion Moroccan dirhams ($3.2 billion) in total demand for only MAD 500 million in shares. The healthcare equipment supplier’s offering attracted nearly 38,000 investors from 48 countries including buyers from the UK, UAE, France, the US, and Luxembourg, demonstrating international appetite for Morocco’s growing equity market.

Vicenne raised MAD 500 million by selling 2.1 million shares at a subscription price of MAD 236 per share, with the Bourse de Casablanca commenting that “this operation confirms the Casablanca Stock Exchange’s ability to concretely support the development of Moroccan companies by offering them effective and accessible financing solutions, regardless of their size or sector of activity.”

Beyond the completed 2025 listings, the pipeline remains robust. GPC Carton, a packaging manufacturer benefiting from Morocco’s position as leading exporter of corrugated papers and cartons in the Middle East and North Africa region, is preparing its listing. Other major companies including Dislog, Diana Holding, and Ynna Holding are reportedly considering public offerings, pointing to renewed momentum and confidence in the Casablanca market as a viable channel for raising growth capital.

Structural Reforms Drive Market Revival

The resurgence of the Casablanca Stock Exchange reflects deeper structural reforms implemented by Moroccan authorities in collaboration with international partners such as the World Bank. These reforms aim to modernize the exchange, attract more foreign capital, and establish Morocco as a regional financial center. According to Raef Kawar, a partner at Rabat-based investment banking firm EuraBridge, “Morocco has understood that to be able to attract more capital, we need to have the standards that potential investors are looking for.”

The government has introduced new financial instruments including sukuks and green bonds to broaden financing options, while finalizing plans to introduce a derivatives market that would allow investors to trade and manage risk more efficiently. These initiatives reflect recognition that developing robust, internationally competitive capital markets is essential for financing Morocco’s ambitious infrastructure and economic diversification programs without excessive reliance on government budgets or foreign debt.

The improved regulatory environment and enhanced market infrastructure have begun attracting foreign institutional investors who previously viewed Morocco as insufficiently developed for meaningful capital allocation. The 64-times oversubscription of Vicenne’s IPO, with more than 17 percent of institutional allocations going to foreign investors, demonstrates that international capital is responding to Morocco’s reform efforts and recognizes the country’s investment potential.

Private equity firms including Mediterrania Capital Partners have structured several recent listings including Cash Plus, Akdital, TGCC, and CMGP, bringing sophisticated financial engineering and institutional credibility to the market. This participation by established private equity investors provides validation of company quality and corporate governance standards, making public offerings more attractive to risk-averse retail and institutional investors.

Capital Markets Performance and Economic Context

Morocco’s stock market performance has been exceptional by regional and global standards. The MASI index rose 74 percent from early 2023 through late 2025, dramatically outperforming most developed and emerging market indices over the same period. The index gained 1.30 percent to close at 19,168.83 points in a single day during July, bringing its year-to-date performance to an impressive 29.75 percent.

Total market fundraising reached MAD 3.4 billion ($340 million) in 2025, surpassing 2024’s MAD 3.1 billion and demonstrating sustained momentum in primary market activity. Since 2022, IPOs have raised more than MAD 147 billion ($14.7 billion), confirming the growing appeal and maturity of the Casablanca market for both companies seeking funding and investors looking for new opportunities.

This capital markets revival occurs against a backdrop of solid macroeconomic performance despite global uncertainties. According to the High Commission for Planning, Morocco’s economic growth accelerated to 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2025, up from 3.0 percent a year earlier, primarily driven by a 4.6 percent increase in non-agricultural activities stimulated by major infrastructure projects related to AFCON 2025 and World Cup 2030 preparation.

Public finances remain under control despite increased infrastructure spending, with the central bank projecting a budget deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP for 2025. This trajectory is supported by increased tax revenues from economic growth and rigorous expenditure management that prioritizes high-impact investments while containing current spending. The government has structured World Cup-related financing through innovative mechanisms including public-private partnerships and specialized funding vehicles that avoid burdening the general state budget.

Investment Banking and Market Infrastructure

SGTM’s IPO benefits from sophisticated financial advisory services provided by Morocco’s leading investment banks. Attijari Finances Corp., the investment banking arm of Attijariwafa Bank, is acting as the financial advisor and global coordinator for the offering, bringing decades of capital markets experience and deep relationships with institutional investors across Morocco, Africa, and Europe.

Attijari Intermédiation serves as lead manager of the placement syndicate, coordinating the distribution of shares to various investor categories. Co-lead managers include BMCE Capital, Saham Capital Bourse, CFG Bank Capital Markets, and Upline Securities, ensuring broad distribution capacity and access to diverse investor bases ranging from retail individuals to large institutional asset managers.

This syndicate structure reflects best practices in emerging market IPOs, where multiple banks collaborate to maximize distribution while managing pricing and allocation decisions. The competitive dynamics among syndicate members help ensure aggressive marketing efforts while the coordination provided by the global coordinator maintains consistency in messaging and execution.

Broader Implications for Moroccan Capital Markets

The SGTM IPO carries significance that extends well beyond the transaction itself, representing validation of Morocco’s economic trajectory and capital markets infrastructure. The overwhelming investor response—173,000 subscribers generating MAD 171 billion in demand—demonstrates that retail investors, who have historically been skeptical of equities, are now willing to allocate capital to well-structured offerings backed by companies with strong fundamentals and visible growth prospects.

This shift in investor psychology reflects multiple factors: improved corporate governance standards that provide better protection for minority shareholders, enhanced disclosure requirements that increase transparency and reduce information asymmetry, growing financial literacy as more Moroccans gain exposure to capital markets through various channels, and concrete examples of wealth creation through earlier IPOs that have delivered strong returns for subscribers.

For other Moroccan companies contemplating public listings, SGTM’s success provides a powerful demonstration effect. The ability to raise MAD 5 billion at premium valuations while generating extraordinary oversubscription proves that the market has capacity to absorb large offerings when properly structured and marketed. This should encourage additional companies to consider IPOs as viable alternatives to private equity or debt financing for funding growth initiatives.

The diversification of listed sectors—from healthcare (Vicenne) to fintech (Cash Plus) to construction (SGTM)—enhances the attractiveness of the Casablanca exchange to portfolio investors seeking sectoral diversity. Previously, the market was heavily weighted toward financials and materials, limiting options for investors wanting broad economic exposure. The addition of high-growth companies from various sectors creates more balanced index composition and reduces concentration risk.

Challenges and Risk Factors

Despite the overwhelmingly positive market reception, SGTM and the broader Moroccan construction sector face legitimate challenges that could impact future performance. The surge in contracts brings operational pressures including scarcity of qualified talent in engineering and project management roles, rising input costs for materials and equipment that compress margins, execution risk associated with delivering multiple large projects simultaneously, and working capital requirements that increase as the company scales operations.

SGTM’s international expansion ambitions, including pursuit of contracts in the Middle East region and particularly in Saudi Arabia for the 2034 World Cup, introduce additional complexities related to operating in unfamiliar regulatory environments, managing currency exposures, competing against well-established international contractors, and adapting to different construction standards and practices.

The concentration of revenue growth on World Cup-related projects creates temporary demand that will eventually moderate, requiring SGTM to identify sustainable growth drivers beyond the tournament cycle. While infrastructure investment is expected to remain elevated through 2030, the post-World Cup environment could see reduced public sector contracting volumes unless Morocco successfully transitions to a more diversified industrial and services economy that generates ongoing construction demand.

Macroeconomic risks include potential fiscal constraints if government revenues disappoint or if debt servicing costs rise significantly, currency volatility that could impact import costs for equipment and materials, inflationary pressures that erode purchasing power and increase wage demands, and external shocks such as regional instability or global economic downturns that reduce investor confidence and capital flows.

Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Morocco’s Financial Future

SGTM’s record-breaking IPO represents more than a successful capital-raising transaction for a single company—it marks a defining moment in the evolution of Morocco’s capital markets and broader economic development trajectory. The offering’s overwhelming reception, with nearly 173,000 subscribers generating demand 34 times the available supply, validates years of regulatory reform and demonstrates that Morocco has successfully created a functioning equity market capable of channeling domestic savings toward productive investments.

The timing of SGTM’s listing, coinciding with historic infrastructure investment programs tied to AFCON 2025 and World Cup 2030, positions the company to benefit from extraordinary growth opportunities while providing public market investors with direct exposure to Morocco’s transformation. The construction sector’s central role in the country’s development strategy—representing 6 percent of GDP and 16 percent of employment—ensures that SGTM’s fortunes are closely tied to national success.

For the Casablanca Stock Exchange, the successive listings of Vicenne, Cash Plus, and SGTM in 2025 highlight a market gaining momentum and capable of mobilizing public savings to support high-value projects. Since 2022, IPOs have raised more than MAD 147 billion, confirming that the exchange has matured into a credible capital formation mechanism that complements traditional bank lending and foreign direct investment.

Looking ahead, the continued development of Morocco’s capital markets depends on sustaining the reform momentum, expanding the investor base both domestically and internationally, encouraging more companies to consider public listings, and maintaining the quality of corporate governance and disclosure that underpins investor confidence. If these conditions are met, the Casablanca Stock Exchange could evolve into a true regional financial center, attracting capital from across Africa and the Middle East while providing Moroccan companies with efficient access to growth financing.

SGTM’s December 16 trading debut will provide the ultimate test of market sentiment, with opening price performance signaling whether the extraordinary subscription demand translates into sustained buying pressure from investors who missed allocation opportunities. If the stock performs well in the aftermarket, it will encourage the pipeline of companies contemplating IPOs while reinforcing retail investor enthusiasm for equity participation.

The renaissance of Morocco’s capital markets, exemplified by SGTM’s landmark offering, demonstrates that emerging markets with sound fundamentals, credible institutions, and compelling growth narratives can attract substantial capital even in an uncertain global environment. As infrastructure investment accelerates and economic diversification progresses, Morocco’s experience may provide a template for other African nations seeking to develop robust domestic capital markets that reduce dependence on external financing while empowering local entrepreneurs and investors to build shared prosperity.
