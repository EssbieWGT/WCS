Between 2023 and 2024, eight workers filed complaints with the ministry over how they were hired to work at the Canadian Tire store.
Previously, a Canadian Tire store in Toronto started being investigated by both provincial and federal authorities following allegations of mistreatment and financial exploitation of employees hired under Ottawa’s Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program.

The province’s Ministry of Labour found that Jones and her two businesses charged the workers between US$7,900 and US$12,000 to secure work permits and jobs at a Canadian Tire location in Toronto, The Globe and Mail reported.

None of the workers were aware at the time that charging recruitment fees is unlawful. Between 2023 and 2024, eight workers filed complaints with the ministry over how they were hired to work at the Canadian Tire store.

Previously, a Canadian Tire store in Toronto started being investigated by both provincial and federal authorities following allegations of mistreatment and financial exploitation of employees hired under Ottawa’s Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program.

Earlier this year, Canadian Tire announced it will be closing some stores under its Atmosphere brand as part of a four-year restructuring strategy.

Entities ‘functioned as one comprehensive and unified business’

The Ontario Ministry of Labour fined Jones $2,000 and ordered two companies she owns—Allison Jones Consulting Services Inc. and AJ Immigration Group Inc.—to reimburse the foreign workers up to a total of $150,000, according to the report.

Jones has 30 days to appeal the decision, which was issued on May 15.

The recruiter has maintained that the decision was made “in error” and that she operated lawfully because her businesses were separate entities, with fees charged by the immigration consultancy, AJ Immigration Group.

However, the ministry found that Allison Jones Consulting and AJ Immigration Group were associated, as they were commonly owned and managed by Jones, and shared employees who worked out of the same office in St. Albert, Alta.

“Although the information provided by the employer alludes to the fact that two businesses operated under different entities, it does not change the fact that both functioned as one comprehensive and unified business, and must be treated as one,” the decision stated, according to The Globe and Mail.

The decision also noted that Jones tried to skirt the law by “having fees fall under AJ Immigration Group Inc.” after each stage of the recruitment process.

‘A small business cost’

Despite the decision against the recruiter, labour lawyers and immigration experts are criticising how the law does little to prevent exploitation of foreign workers.

“Ultimately, $250 is a small business cost for an unscrupulous recruiter or employer, or a licence fee for breaking the law,” said John No, staff lawyer and interim director of the Parkdale Legal Clinic, in The Globe and Mail’s report.

It’s also problematic that the law requires foreign workers to file complaints against bad employers or recruiters if they become victimised, said Chris Ramsaroop, assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto and an organiser with Justice for Migrant Workers, in the same report.

“This case against Allison Jones began because the workers filed complaints with the ministry. What the ministry should do now is attempt to get compensation for all foreign workers who ever paid fees to this recruiter – but that’s unfortunately not how the system works.”

(CSE: NERD | OTCQB: NOSUF), a 30-year-old Canadian firm that has quietly built a nationwide army of “nerds” to protect more than 12,000 small and mid size enterprises—and marquee clients such as Canadian Tire, Home Hardware and Tim Horton’s—from the dark web’s relentless data hunters.

Founded in 1995, the London, Ontario–based company touts sovereign data custody as its north star, offering tailored cybersecurity packages that Regan describes as “nerd care,” delivered through a proprietary ERP platform that routes 30–50 fresh service requests a day to its technicians. “Everyone is a target,” he tells InvestorNews host Tracy Hughes, rebutting the notion that smaller players can hide in the crowd. While the residential and SME segments remain the core, Nerds is scaling up: its new NOS Technical Services division already places IT contractors in seven U.S. states and for multinational pharma firms. In the fiscal year ended May 31, unaudited revenue rose “about 15-plus percent” year over year, setting the stage, Regan says, for the first profit month since the 2018 IPO “by the end of this calendar year.”

The company’s latest quarterly filing underscores that trajectory, reporting six-month revenue of C$5.5 million—up 5 percent—with fresh initiatives such as Nerds On Line (unlimited remote IT support) and a Canada-U.S. marketing push aimed at turning what Regan calls “an incredibly attractive share price” into broader investor recognition. “Nobody calls because they’ve got smoke,” he quips. “People call because there’s a fire,” and Nerds’ mission is to “stop them cold in their tracks.”

Just as you wouldn't expect to transform your company culture overnight by edict, it's unreasonable to expect something different from your AI transformation.
With every AI acceleration win, we uncover more places to improve hand-offs, activation speed, and business decision-making.","Ask technologists and enterprise leaders what they hope AI will deliver, and most will land on some iteration of the ""T"" word: transformation. No surprise, AI and its “cooler than you” cousin, generative AI (GenAI), have been hyped nonstop for the past 24 months.

But therein lies the problem.

Many organizations are rushing to implement AI without a grasp on the return on investment (ROI), leading to high spend and low impact. Without anchoring AI to clear friction points and acceleration opportunities, companies invite fatigue, anxiety and competitive risk. Two-thirds of C-suite execs say GenAI has created tension and division within their organizations; nearly half say it’s “tearing their company apart.” Most (71%) report adoption challenges; more than a third call it a massive disappointment.

While AI's potential is irrefutable, companies need to reject the narrative of AI as a standalone strategy or transformational savior. Its true power is as a catalyst to amplify what already works and surface what could. Here are three principles to make that happen.

1. Start with friction, not function

Many enterprises struggle with where to start when integrating AI. My advice: Start where the pain is greatest. Identify the processes that create the most friction and work backward from there. AI is a tool, not a solution. By mapping real pain points to AI use cases, you can hone investments to the ripest fruit rather than simply where it hangs at the lowest.

For example, one of our top sources of customer pain was troubleshooting undeliverable messages, which forced users to sift through error code documentation. To solve this, an AI assistant was introduced to detect anomalies, explain causes in natural language, and guide customers toward resolution. We achieved a 97% real-time resolution rate through a blend of conversational AI and live support.

Most companies have long-standing friction points that support teams routinely explain. Or that you’ve developed organizational calluses over; problems considered “just the cost of doing business.” GenAI allows leaders to revisit these areas and reimagine what’s possible.

2. The need for (dual) speed

We hear stories of leaders pushing an “all or nothing” version of AI transformation: Use AI to cut functional headcount or die. Rather than leading with a “stick” through wholesale transformation mandates or threats to budgets, we must recognize AI implementation as a fundamental culture change. Just as you wouldn't expect to transform your company culture overnight by edict, it's unreasonable to expect something different from your AI transformation.

Some leaders have a tendency to move faster than the innovation ability or comfort level of their people. Most functional leads aren’t obstinate in their slow adoption of AI tools, their long-held beliefs to run a process or to assess risks. We hired these leaders for their decades of experience in “what good looks like” and deep expertise in incremental improvements; then we expect them to suddenly define a futuristic vision that challenges their own beliefs. As executive leaders, we must give grace, space and plenty of “carrots” -- incentives, training, and support resources -- to help them reimagine complex workflows with AI.

And, we must recognize that AI has the ability to make progress in ways that may not immediately create cost efficiencies, such as for operational improvements that require data cleansing, deep analytics, forecasting, dynamic pricing, and signal sensing. These aren’t the sexy parts of AI, but they’re the types of issues that require superhuman intelligence and complex problem-solving that AI was made for.

3. A flywheel of acceleration

The other transformation that AI should support is creating faster and broader “test and learn” cycles. AI implementation is not a linear process with start here and end there. Organizations that want to leverage AI as a competitive advantage should establish use cases where AI can break down company silos and act as a catalyst to identify the next opportunity. That identifies the next as a flywheel of acceleration. This flywheel builds on accumulated learnings, making small successes into larger wins while avoiding costly AI disasters from rushed implementation.

For example, at Twilio we are building a customer intelligence platform that analyzes thousands of conversations to identify patterns and drive insights. If we see multiple customers mention a competitor's pricing, it could signal a take-out campaign. What once took weeks to recognize and escalate can now be done in near real-time and used for highly coordinated activations across marketing, product, sales, and other teams.

With every AI acceleration win, we uncover more places to improve hand-offs, activation speed, and business decision-making. That flywheel of innovation is how true AI transformation begins to drive impactful business outcomes.

Ideas to Fuel Your AI Strategy

Organizations can accelerate their AI implementations through these simple shifts in approach:

The most impactful AI implementations don’t rush transformation; they strategically accelerate core capabilities and unlock new ones to drive measurable change.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/bltb903aa33db8b2181/684734c2fd3e28c1f4ea1369/Innovation-peshkova-adobe1.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-13 09:18:27.899546

“When I joined (Instacart) in 2021, I had the luxury of being on the board for six months,” Simo said.
Read more: OpenAI Picks Instacart Chief Fidji Simo to Oversee Operations Entering the Big Leagues Simo’s new role at OpenAI positions her at the center of one of the most consequential companies in AI.
At Instacart, Simo launched a framework that included AI training for employees and designated internal “advocates” to help teams adopt new tools.
As OpenAI prepares for its next wave of growth, Simo’s appointment signals a shift toward developing AI products for the mass market at scale.","Speaking at the VivaTech 2025 conference in Paris — her first public interview since being named OpenAI’s CEO of applications in May — Simo said the opportunity for growth is “100x — and that’s just the beginning.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a post on X announcing her hiring, called Simo an “exceptional” candidate to help OpenAI “scale the next 10x or 100x.”

During a fireside chat on Thursday (June 12), Simo laid out a bold vision for how AI could become an “ambient layer” in everyday life, reshaping how billions of people work, learn, shop and manage their health.

Simo, who will officially join OpenAI in August, will report directly to Altman and lead the charge to translate the company’s cutting-edge research into mass-market applications.

“My team is really in charge of taking the incredible research breakthroughs that the company generates and really making sure that we distribute them to society in the best possible way, so that people see the benefits of AI,” said Simo, whom the interviewer called the most powerful French woman in tech. “That gets reflected into an empowerment in their lives.”

Simo said AI is going to empower everyone to “reclaim some of our time through productivity. It’s going to make us express our creative potential even more through all the creative tools. It’s going to allow us to get access to knowledge and wisdom that in the past was limited to the most fortunate among us. It’s going to allow us to gain power in many different ways.”

Simo joins OpenAI at a pivotal time. Its recent acquisition of io, the AI devices startup of former Apple designer Jony Ive — along with OpenAI’s foundation models, plus Simo leading applications — will create a multi-layered company with a diverse product line.

Simo brings to OpenAI a track record of consumer tech transformation. At Instacart, she said she took the pandemic-era food delivery company and rebuilt it into a data-rich platform powering the digital transformation of grocery shopping.

“When I joined (Instacart) in 2021, I had the luxury of being on the board for six months,” Simo said. “It was right after the peak of the pandemic, and a lot of people were wondering if grocery delivery was going to be just a fad or something really enduring.”

Instead, Simo saw a longer-term opportunity: help brick-and-mortar grocers digitize every aspect of their operations, from supply chain to advertising.

Under her leadership, Instacart launched a retail media network and AI-enhanced shopping tools, including the “Caper Cart” — a smart shopping cart that uses computer vision and AI to identify items as consumers add them while suggesting other products and offering them personalized promotions in real time.

Asked why fully automated stores like Amazon’s Go have not gained traction, Simo said that customers “do not want a store that’s completely devoid of people.” Instead, these technologies can help augment human labor. “It’s really the magic combo, and we see that as augmentation and not replacement.”

Internally, Simo spearheaded a company-wide AI adoption initiative at Instacart, pushing every team to identify repetitive tasks and explore AI solutions. The results: 87% of code written by engineers is now AI-assisted, marketing teams use AI to turn existing food images into videos and reused in new campaigns, the PR team used AI journalist personas to practice press interviews, and the legal team uses AI to parse through documents like contracts.

“The entire company is AI-enabled,” Simo said.

Entering the Big Leagues

Simo’s new role at OpenAI positions her at the center of one of the most consequential companies in AI. While ChatGPT made AI into a household word, the future of OpenAI goes well beyond the chatbot and large language models, according to Simo.

“You can start thinking of AI as an ambient layer,” Simo said. “Not just enabled through GPT, but potentially through devices.”

OpenAI already touches hundreds of millions of users, but Simo believes there is growth potential in enabling “a team of agents at their service” — helping individuals in everything from education to healthcare and daily activities.

However, agentic AI, while full of promise, isn’t quite ready for prime time. A June 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report said that “with adoption of generative artificial intelligence nearly universal across large companies, excitement is building around agentic AI, which goes one step further to make its own decisions and act fully autonomously.”

“Yet current GenAI implementations consistently require human oversight, raising questions over how agentic AI, a next-generation software that operates entirely free of humans, can reach its full potential,” the report added.

The report, “AI at the Crossroads: Agentic Ambitions Meet Operational Realities,” said at this stage, chief operating officers are still not ready for autonomous AI agents that can reliably perform high-risk tasks without human supervision.

Asked why so many enterprise AI efforts fail, Simo pointed to a common pitfall: implementing AI for its own sake. Companies need to start with problems they want to solve; every company has tasks that are tedious or repetitive that AI can tackle, she said.

At Instacart, Simo launched a framework that included AI training for employees and designated internal “advocates” to help teams adopt new tools. She said this approach could inform how OpenAI scales its own applications — embedding AI into real workflows and building the infrastructure for broad societal adoption.

Simo also brings a personal motivation to her work in AI. Diagnosed with a “pretty nasty” neuroimmune condition in 2020, she founded a research institute to collect health data in hopes of accelerating medical discoveries using AI. She sees AI’s near-term potential in democratizing access to health knowledge — helping the 90% of people who say they struggle to understand medical information.

As OpenAI prepares for its next wave of growth, Simo’s appointment signals a shift toward developing AI products for the mass market at scale.

“ChatGPT reaches hundreds of millions of people, but really, AI should change lives for everyone,” Simo said. “We need to be reaching billions. And then once you reach billions, you also need to make sure that each person can find value in multiple use cases.”

PowerBond reportedly works in a variety of food applications, including baked goods and meat alternatives. MaGie Creations claims it is a viable and price-competitive replacement for several existing additives.

Elsewhere in the world, other companies have also used upcycled brewers’ grain to produce innovative products — for example, Switzerland’s Circular Food Solutions has developed meat alternatives using the ingredient, while Singapore’s Prefer ferments brewers’ grain with other upcycled ingredients to produce a bean-free coffee alternative.

“The future of food isn’t just about what we eat — it’s about how we make it,” said Ellen van der Starre, Product Development Lead at MaGie. “We need comprehensive, systemic solutions that begin with reimagining food production.

Chick-fil-A has also brought back a favorite shake and debuted a new seasonal beverage. Meanwhile, Sonic Drive-In has made some recent moves with its drinks.

FOX Business takes a look at the hot new menu items the chains have rolled out.

Chick-fil-A

Chick-fil-A’s popular Peach Milkshake made its summertime comeback for the 16th year on Monday.

The shake ""features Chick-fil-A Icedream dessert and peaches, topped off with whipped cream and a cherry,"" according to the company.

Taco Bell

Crispy chicken nuggets made a reappearance at Taco Bell beginning April 24 for a limited time.

They are ""marinated in a zesty jalapeño buttermilk flavor"" and ""breaded with a blend of breadcrumbs and crispy tortilla chips,"" according to Taco Bell.

The Yum! Brands-owned chain had previously had the crispy chicken nuggets on its menu for a limited time last year, and they sold out in a week.

Last month, Taco Bell introduced a limited-time Mike’s Hot Honey Diablo Sauce as one of the dipping sauce options for the crispy chicken nuggets.

Taco Bell customers also saw the chain recently launch Loaded Steak & Jalapeno Topped Fries for a limited time.

They consist of nacho fries ""topped with warm nacho cheese sauce, grilled marinated steak, creamy jalapeno sauce and pickled jalapenos,"" according to the company.

McDonald’s

McDonald’s debuted McCrispy Strips in the U.S. starting in late April, with all participating restaurants across the country offering them by May 5.

The strips, which are coated with breading and have a black-pepper flavor, marked the chain’s first new permanent menu item in about four years.

MCDONALD'S ADDING BRAND-NEW MENU ITEM: MCCRISPY STRIPS

McDonald’s snack wraps, which are returning in July, will have a McCrispy Strip inside as well as shredded lettuce and cheese, the chain said this month.

The chain said it makes the protein option with ""fresh chicken hot off the grill, seasoned with savory Mexican spices, in a marinade of seared, smoked chipotle peppers and a touch of pure honey.""

In late April, Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright told analysts and investors during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that the Chipotle Honey Chicken has ""had a higher mix than any other limited-time offer, even surpassing its two-market pilot test."" He also said it was ""driving incremental transactions"" and guest feedback ""has been overwhelmingly positive.""

The Chipotle Honey Chicken previously underwent ""stage-gate testing"" in Nashville, Tennessee, and Sacramento, California, last year, per a press release.

Sonic

Sweet Topped Lemonades debuted at Sonic Drive-In locations across the U.S. in early June.

The new drinks, released in time for summer, come in three different flavors: Classic Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade and Blueberry Lavender Lemonade.

They ""combine tart, all-natural lemonade with velvety smooth cold foam on top,"" Sonic said.

They were previously available at Sonic in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Burger King

A limited-time menu that draws inspiration from the soon-to-be-released ""How to Train Your Dragon"" live-action movie arrived at Burger King in late May.

Its launch, part of a collaboration with Universal Pictures, came a couple of weeks ahead of the film’s theatrical debut, which is slated for Friday.

The items in the ""How to Train Your Dragon""-inspired limited-time menu include a Dragon Flame-Grilled Whopper, Fiery Dragon Mozzarella Fries, Viking’s Chocolate Sundae and Soaring Strawberry Lemonade, according to the chain.

Hot new menu items at Popeyes include its chicken wraps, fried pickles and pickle-glazer chicken sandwich, according to the chain.

Popeyes Chicken Wraps, a competitor to the McDonald's returning snack wrap, came out in early June and will be available for a limited time while supplies last, Popeyes said in a press release.

They feature a chicken tender, lettuce, shredded cheese, pickles and one of three spreads. The options for the spreads are Classic, Spicy or Honey Mustard.

The fried pickles and Popeyes pickle glaze chicken sandwich debuted at the beginning of April.

Blades said uncertainty, higher input costs and higher interest rates continue to hamper tractor sales.
Total farm tractor sales through May hit 80,332, down 12.8% from the first five months of 2024.
Self-propelled combine sales — measured as a separate category by AEM — were down 43% to 1,253 year-to-date.
In 2024, tractor sales fell 13.2% compared to the previous year, while combine sales dropped 24.3%.","New farm tractor and combine sales continue to lag in 2025 after a slowdown that started the previous year, according to the latest report from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.

Soft sales led savvy dealerships to focus on service and aftermarket upgrades such as precision agriculture technology, said Curt Blades, AEM vice president.

SS Equipment New Holland, headquartered in Pasco, Wash., focused on deals with winter overhaul programs, said Jay Herbers, corporate sales manager. The economy has been tight, limiting sales of tractors, combines, swathers and bailers, he said.

“The biggest thing in this economy is selling your business as a whole,” Herbers said.Salesmen need to promote the dealership’s parts and service out in the field.

Chad Hochstetler, general manager for Rickreall Farm Supply, a Kubota dealership in Rickreall, Ore., said farmers and ranchers were making investments in their existing equipment.

“People are trying to be resourceful,” he said.

In some cases, that means seeking versatility and using tractors as “Swiss Army knives.”

“How can we make our tractors do more things? That’s some of what is occurring in the market right now,” Hochstetler said.

Hochstetler was hopeful sales would improve in the third and fourth quarter of 2025 as agricultural uncertainty regarding trade and other matters is resolved.

Herbers said there was optimism.

“When you’re able to get a quote to a guy, it’s trending upwards,” he said.

Farmland Tractor in Tangent, Ore., sells tractor parts and when the economy is tough, parts sales increase, said Ty Raschein, whose family owns and operates the business.

“Nobody is buying new, they’re fixing old, so that’s better for us,” he said.

Raschein said margins are tight across the country, including in Linn County, Ore., where grass seed isn’t moving.

Blades said uncertainty, higher input costs and higher interest rates continue to hamper tractor sales.

Preliminary data also indicates that the fleet age for tractors and combines is relatively young, with many farmers, ranchers and rural residents making larger purchases within the past eight years.

During the pandemic, for example, dealerships experienced record high sales of tractors less than 40 hp as people were stuck at home.

Combine sales are sharply down, but were strong just a few years ago thanks to advancements with precision agriculture.

AEM data showed sales of tractors from 40 hp to 100 hp suffered the smallest percentage drop year-to-date in 2025.

Herbers said mid-range tractors sales for machines from 75 hp to 100 hp were decent, in part because ranchers use those machines and beef is a hot segment.

Hochstetler said the sweet spot for sales at Rickreall Farm Supply was from 40 hp to 80 hp.

“It isn’t bad. It’s down slightly,” he said.

Total farm tractor sales through May hit 80,332, down 12.8% from the first five months of 2024.

Self-propelled combine sales — measured as a separate category by AEM — were down 43% to 1,253 year-to-date.

Neither Google nor HP have revealed the price of a separate Google Beam license to gain access to Zoom or Google Meet.","Contents

HP is the first company to launch a hardware product based on Google's 3D video call technology, Google Beam. The technology is designed to ensure that users perceive a “lifelike image” of the person in front of them. However, at 25,000 US dollars, HP's solution is not cheap.

Anzeige

Light field screen, many cameras, and AI

The HP Dimension has a 65-inch light field display with 8K resolution and six high-speed cameras that are embedded in the frame of the housing to create an almost spatial video image of the user. A “state-of-the-art volumetric AI video model” is used for this effect, which converts “2D video streams into realistic 3D”, explains Google.

To create a 3D effect of the other person, an optical layer is attached above the panel, which apparently consists of microlenses. These can influence the direction of the light rays emitted by the panel to create a spatial view of the person. Spatial audio and adaptive backlighting are intended to create a stronger immersion effect.

In development for years

The technology was first presented by Google at I/O 2021 as Project Starline. The prototype shown at the time, which consisted of a 65-inch 8K panel, speakers, microphones, lighting, a computer and several camera sets, was the size of a separate dining area in a restaurant. Since then, the company has been able to reduce the technology so that it is not larger than a flat-screen TV.

In the course of I/O 2025, Google renamed the 3D video conferencing solution Google Beam and brought HP on board as its first hardware partner. Google had previously conducted test runs with the conferencing solution within its own company and with an early access program. Salesforce, T-Mobile and Wework, among others, took part in the program to gather practical data on how the solution can help colleagues working remotely to stay connected.

Anzeige

According to Google's initial findings from 2023, the interaction between people during video calls via the 3D video conferencing solution should be more interactive. In terms of non-verbal behaviors, participants were more animated and used significantly more hand gestures, head nods and eyebrow movements.

Participants also reported a significantly better ability to perceive and communicate non-verbal behaviors than in conventional video conferencing. According to Google, the conversational dynamics were also higher than in conventional calls.

However, the 3D conferencing solution has one major limitation: only one person per screen can take part in the video calls, as face and eye tracking, among other things, does not work with multiple people.

25,000 dollars just for the hardware

HP's Dimension is intended for use in companies, costs 25,000 dollars and will be launched in the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, and Japan this year, according to the manufacturer. Companies such as Salesforce, Deloitte and NEC have already agreed to bring Google Beam into their offices.

Incidentally, the purchase price of the 3D video conferencing system only includes the hardware. Google charges an additional amount for the software license required for video calls.

In the Philips Best organisation, the sleep apnoea affair could never have arisen.” “Philips made little mention of this, but the instructions for use of the apnoea devices said: “clean with washing-up liquid”.","In the late 1990s, Philips confronted a greater challenge than ever before: the company had to reinvent itself. In the second part of a trilogy, Studio040 examines the bureaucracy within Philips and the part it played in the emergence of the disastrous sleep apnoea affair. ‘It had long been known at the top of the company that those devices were inadequate,’ he says.

According to interviews conducted by Studio040 with those well-versed in the company, Philips is less and less the firm that enabled Eindhoven to grow into the technological hotspot it is today. The Eindhoven-based company now mainly makes headlines with new announcements of reorganisations and problems with the FDA—the US Food and Drug Administration—over products that do not function as they should.

Layoffs

In February this year, Philips announced that it was cutting 90 jobs in the Netherlands, including positions in Best and Eindhoven. This news followed an announcement made six months earlier that 400 jobs would be eliminated in the Frisian town of Drachten.

Earlier, in early 2023, the company had revealed plans to cut 6,000 jobs globally—of which 1,100 were in the Netherlands. This came just a few months after October 2022, when Philips announced 800 job cuts in the Netherlands as part of a global reduction of 4,000 positions.

Over two years, Philips reduced its workforce in the Netherlands by 20 per cent, while worldwide job losses amounted to around 13 per cent. To put this in perspective: during the large-scale reorganisation known as Operation Centurion in the 1990s, about 16.5 per cent of jobs were lost, with 45,000 out of more than 300,000 employees being given notice.

Spaghetti

The gigantic bureaucracy that had to be done away with in the 1990s is still there at the company. “Boonstra said Philips was spaghetti and he wanted to turn it into asparagus. To transform the company from a big tangle of strands into a manageable number of streamlined divisions. It never succeeded, that much is clear, but it is much less spaghetti,” says Jan Post, who was a top executive at Philips for many years.

That picture is also confirmed by former employee Rens van Leeuwen, who worked at the company for 44 years and served on the works council for six years. “What keeps coming back is a far too thick management layer at the top. At Philips, there are 10 to 15 management layers between the shop floor and the top. If you want to manage 100,000 people and you have a maximum of 10 per manager then five management layers are enough.”

Brilliant Minds

‘If you want to report a problem to management, you’re told it’s someone else’s responsibility and passed from one manager to another,’ says Van Leeuwen. ‘Responsibilities are spread across far too many managers, so it’s unclear to them whether they have the authority to make a particular decision.’

‘As a result, a lot of good ideas from the shop floor end up being discarded. Philips is still able to attract brilliant people, but you have to give them meaningful work—and at the moment, that happens all too rarely. The real expertise is on the shop floor; as a manager, your job is to guide the output. If you never set foot in a lab, you’ll never truly understand electrical engineering.’

“A number of products and functions are placed outside the Netherlands. This has been the case for some time, Poland, Batam in Indonesia, China, India and if things don’t go well there, then people no longer know how the lines of communication are within the company and how to make contacts internationally. Then you have the distance barrier, language barrier, culture barrier, and the knowledge barrier,” Van Leeuwen continues.

‘But remarkably, this also plays out in the Netherlands,’ says Patrick Meerts of the FNV. “In Drachten the other day, they told me that so do not know what the organisation is like either. If your supervisor is in China or Indonesia, it’s all quite complicated. But an executive or a human resources department around the corner is past glory.”

Sleep apnoea

One of the problems that broke the company recently, the widely publicised sleep apnoea affair, is also related to this. The problems with sleep apnoea devices continued to simmer on within the company for a long time before effective action was taken.

‘The sleep apnoea problem was known much earlier,’ says Arjan Huizinga, who has been doing collective bargaining with Philips on behalf of the CNV union for more than a decade.

“If you let it fester too long, after a while you get a big pus. In my experience, they have hoped to keep it under wraps. This is not good for customer confidence. The claims world is not so big in the Netherlands but it is in the United States, where all kinds of lawyers pop up wanting money. Then the problem becomes very big and it takes years to recover from that. They should have responded to it proactively”,

Best

‘Within the development department in Best, the sleep apnoea affair was met with astonishment,’ Van Leeuwen indicates. “In Best, an incredible amount of money and time is spent on patient safety. Much of the development capacity is spent on meeting FDA requirements and the even more stringent MDR/IVDR, the European counterpart of the FDA.”

“There is a huge and influential Quality&Regulation department within Philips Best that is purely concerned with checking that all new developments, improvements and modifications are sufficiently tested according to FDA and MDR/IVDR regulations. Every developer is aware of this. In the Philips Best organisation, the sleep apnoea affair could never have arisen.”

“Philips made little mention of this, but the instructions for use of the apnoea devices said: “clean with washing-up liquid”. But Americans like to clean with ozone, which is very aggressive. Moreover, I personally think the FDA is also to blame. It could also have discovered this at the US facility where apnoea devices are developed. That’s what the whole FDA was set up for, to be able to trust that products coming onto the market can be used safely.”

Wrong acquisition

Jan Post thinks the affair is due to a wrong acquisition. “Philips bought the apnea device company in 2005 and there was a decent gross margin on this product. That’s why it was attractive to buy such a company, it was a gold mine.”

But the Philips management never managed to cash in on that goldmine, a problem that had broken the company before, Post outlines. “We don’t have great experiences with such acquisitions. We once bought Magnavox, an American television brand to gain a foothold in the United States. Americans are not the best manufacturers, there is a lot of brains and research, but production is not as good. That was also a problem then and again now.”

Post does not think the affair arose because of the company’s internal bureaucracy. “I think it was just a misguided acquisition. But it is not representative of the problems at today’s Philips. Illustrative, though? I find that hard to say. You buy a product, you misjudge the production quality, those things happen.”

Outsourcing

Another problem is that Philips outsources developments to suppliers, says Van Leeuwen. “For the development of the MRI scanner, at a certain point we had to have a special chip. Once, the company could make that itself but now we have to build knowledge together with a supplier so that not all knowledge is under Philips management anymore, NXP in this case.”

“There are very reliable and competent suppliers to Philips. Usually they are happy with development orders from Philips and usually they handle them well so that a win-win situation arises. But there always remains a risk, the same goes for the supplier by the way.”

‘High-level outsourcing is what they call it,’ says FNV’s Patrick Meers. “High-quality technology you can get another company to develop. Procurement Department will then calculate whether it is cheaper to have something developed yourself or by another company – so it is only about money. But that way, the knowledge you pay for is built up outside your own company. If that company, quits or goes bankrupt, you lose your knowledge. And those companies that are brought in often make a profit, while Philips sits bleeding.”

For decades, banks viewed relationships with the defense sector as “dirty money” that could damage their reputations. But that perception has changed dramatically since Feb. 24, 2022, in parallel with the European Union and its member states increasing their defense spending.

Bloomberg reported Thursday that the perceived threat from Russia, combined with US reluctance to engage fully with Europe, has prompted governments to reverse a decades-long effort to benefit from the “peace dividend” following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

With hundreds of billions of euros in the pipeline, some of Europe’s largest financial institutions are now actively preparing to support the continent’s defense sector. These include France’s BNP Paribas and Société Générale, Germany’s Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, the Netherlands’ ING Groep NV, and the European Investment Bank (EIB).

According to the report, banks are hiring staff and setting up teams that will specialize in working with defense-related government departments and companies. Bloomberg says the EIB alone is currently working on 20 separate defense-related projects. Banks are expected not only to profit from the boom in defense contracts but also to gain a reputational boost for supporting European security.

The report cites Fabrizio Campelli, head of global wealth management at Deutsche Bank, as saying the bank is “honored” to work on a €1 billion ($1.2 billion) EIB defense-related project. “We stand ready to reinforce the resilience of Europe’s security and defense,” he said.

ING’s CEO Steven van Rijswijk added, “We dusted off our policy, but we also dusted off our own mindset. From ‘No, unless...’ it has become ‘Yes, unless...,’” describing the bank’s new welcoming attitude toward credit applications from the defense industry. He said the rapid change in approach followed clear signals “from the top.”

Other banks are following suit. BNP Paribas, for example, is said to be doubling or tripling its defense-sector business, and is reportedly streamlining its internal approval process for military transactions.

According to Bloomberg, the European Commission and European governments are taking a proactive role in bringing together the defense industry and financial sector. The European Banking Federation (EBF), a lobbying group representing major European banks, has created a task force to smooth cooperation.

Meanwhile, the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, is expected to propose new measures to address obstacles the defense industry faces—particularly in financing.

Commentators are divided on how much Europe’s banks will ultimately profit from the current defense boom. So far, relatively few contracts have been signed. But bankers are preparing for a wave of business expected in the coming months.

Bloomberg notes that large defense companies rarely need loans, since government orders typically include upfront payments. But smaller firms – especially those producing drones and new military technology – will likely require significant financial support. Arnaud Journois, an analyst at the Morningstar DBRS credit agency, said Ukraine’s drone war is largely sustained by small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups that need a financial leg up.

The future looks bright for Europe’s banks. Diego de Ojeda, head of the European Commission’s Unit for Defense and Preparedness, ended the Bloomberg piece by saying, “Defense is going to be a very good business – there is a massive flow of money coming.”",https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/06/12/4f58396552b8c7af65e89366b59f5b1c.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg,N,,2025-06-13 03:10:27.764160

The latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global, pointed to a further reduction in UK recruitment activity in May. Permanent placements fell at a slightly sharper rate, but the decline in temp billings was the slowest in six months. Concurrently, overall demand for staff fell at a notably softer rate.

The availability of candidates meanwhile rose at the quickest pace for nearly four-and-a-half years amid reports of redundancies and fewer job opportunities. At the same time, rates of starting pay increased further in May, though growth of both starting salaries and temp wages remained weaker than on average.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Hiring activity falls again, particularly for permanent staff

Recruitment activity across the UK continued to slow in May, with survey members reporting that weaker confidence around the outlook and concerns over costs had dampened staff hiring. While permanent staff appointments fell at a slightly quicker and sharp rate, the downturn in temp billings slowed since April to the softest in six months.

Permanent Placements Index

Temporary Billings

50.0 = no-change

Sharpest rise in candidate supply for nearly four-and-a-half years

Candidate availability continued to rise in May, with the rate of growth the steepest since December 2020. Recruiters signalled quicker increases in the supply of both permanent and temporary staff, with the former recording the sharper rate of expansion. There were frequent reports that redundancies and fewer job opportunities had pushed up candidate numbers in the latest survey period.

Vacancies decline at softest rate in eight months

The downturn in demand for staff eased notably in the latest survey period, with total vacancies declining at the weakest rate since last September. Softer reductions were signalled for both permanent and temporary vacancies, though in each case the rate of contraction was solid.

Stronger increases in starting pay

Salaries awarded to new permanent joiners increased further in May, with recruiters often noting that competition for suitably-skilled candidates had driven the latest upturn. The rate of salary inflation was the quickest seen since last August. At the same time, temp wage growth improved to a one-year high. That said, rates of inflation remained below their respective long-run averages.

Regional and Sector Variations

The sharpest reduction in permanent placements was seen in the South of England. The Midlands meanwhile bucked the wider UK trend and recorded the first increase in placements for a year (albeit marginal).

Three of the four monitored English regions registered a decline in temp billings, led by the South of England. In contrast, the Midlands recorded the first expansion in four months.

Seven of the ten monitored job categories registered lower demand for permanent staff in May. Hotel & Catering saw the sharpest reduction in vacancies, followed by the Nursing/Medical/Care and Retail sectors. The strongest uptick in demand was seen in the Engineering category.

Engineering was the only monitored job sector to record an improvement in demand for temporary workers during May. Retail meanwhile saw the steepest drop in vacancies, with sharp contractions also noted across the Executive/Professional and Nursing/Medical/ Care sectors.

Comments

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“May’s data shows very little change. Employers are still holding back on hiring, which meant last month the number of jobseekers increased at the steepest rate since 2020.

“The first half of this year has been full of uncertainty for businesses who are still trying to navigate cost pressures, technology advancements and global risks. Business leaders will want to see how the new trading agreements with the US and EU, Government spending plans and the Modern Industrial Strategy will drive forward our economic growth. To boost the jobs market employers need to feel confident about the outlook and understand how AI will impact their business.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“More encouraging signs in temp billings, vacancies, and stabilising private sector demand offer a measure of optimism as we head into the second half of the year. There are early signs of promise, particularly in the Midlands, which saw its first increase in permanent placements in a year and a rise in billings after four months. Meanwhile, the downturn in temporary billings has eased further in London and the North of England.

“The big test now is whether the Spending Review convinces more employers to dance at the party by turning intent on hiring and investing into action. The Spending Review delivered a big hit in terms of eye-catching spending on technology and energy, but the lack of announcements on workforce matters is badly out of step with its desire to build a deep pool of talent.

“With the Industrial Strategy imminent, businesses are looking for more than talk of renewal, they want a clear plan for an economic revival. One that acknowledges the central role of good workforce policy – beyond just employment rights. That means putting workforce matters at the heart of the agenda, not treating it as a compliance issue.”

Methodology

The KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Survey responses are collected in the second half of each month and indicate the direction of change compared to the previous month. A diffusion index is calculated for each survey variable. The index is the sum of the percentage of ‘higher’ responses and half the percentage of ‘unchanged’ responses. The indices vary between 0 and 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an overall increase compared to the previous month, and below 50 an overall decrease. The indices are then seasonally adjusted.

Underlying survey data are not revised after publication, but seasonal adjustment factors may be revised from time to time as appropriate which will affect the seasonally adjusted data series.

Steel giant, ArcelorMattal Liberia, promises to increase annual County Social Development Fund to $4 million for Liberia.

By Kruah Thompson

Monrovia, Liberia; June 13, 2025 – Acting CEO and chief of operations at ArcelorMattal Liberia, Anthony P. Kocken, has promised to increase the Annual County Social Development Fund to $4 million after conclusion of the third Amendment to its Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) with the Government of Liberia.

The Third Amendment to the Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) between ArcelorMittal and the Government of Liberia is a proposed revision of the existing agreement that governs operations of the company in Liberia, particularly mining of iron ore.

ArcelorMittal, one of the world’s largest steel and mining companies, has been operating in Liberia since the original MDA was signed in 2005, and amended in 2006.

The company mines iron ore primarily from Mount Tokadeh in Nimba County and exports through Buchanan Port Grand Bassa County.

However, as a major economic contributor here, employing thousands and contributing to the national budget, the company came into agreement with the Liberian Government under the third Amendment to Extend ArcelorMittal’s operations for an additional 25 years.

During this period, the company is expected to increase investment to over $1 billion, including expansion of mining operations, construction of a new processing plant in Yekepa, improvements to rail and port infrastructure, increment of production to 15 million tonnes per year, with potential to reach 30 million tonnes, and establish provisions for third-party access to the rail and port infrastructure, which is a key issue for regional integration and access by other mining companies like HPX (High Power Exploration), while addressing community development, local content, and increasing revenue sharing.

Base on this agreement, the House of Representatives passed the amendment in 2022, but the Liberian Senate withheld approval, citing concerns over lack of transparency, insufficient benefits to Liberia and local communities, issues around exclusive control of infrastructure (rail and port) by ArcelorMittal, a need for open access for other companies like HPX and Guinea’s iron ore projects.

As of mid-2024, negotiations and consultations continue, with civil society, government, and international stakeholders involved.

Speaking at MICAT regular press briefing here Thursday, June 12, 2024, Acting CEO Kocken noted that the Annual County Social Development Fund will increase to $4 million, when the Third Amendment is concluded.

On March 25, 2025, Liberia endorsed the User-Operator framework proposed in the Third Amendment to the MDA signed with the government.

He revealed that just one week ago, they stood shoulder to shoulder with the Government and people of Liberia to commission the country’s first-ever iron ore concentrator, a historic milestone that marks not just evolution of their operations, but the beginning of a new era for Liberia

He said they are not only to share what they have accomplished together, but to ignite national excitement about what lies ahead.

“This Phase II expansion is not merely a company investment; it is a national breakthrough. It is a bold affirmation that Liberia can move beyond exporting raw materials to producing high-grade, value-added iron”, Mr. Kocken said.

He recalled that in March Liberia endorsed the User-Operator framework proposed in the Third Amendment to share rail facility with other users.

AML CEO said its rail model, which is widely used for bulk commodity transport in Australia, Brazil, and Canada, has also been successfully implemented in neighboring Guinea.

AML has consented to the Rail System Operating Principles (RSOP) suggested by the Liberian government that ensures transparent and non-discriminatory rail operations.

“Today, we gather not only to share what we have accomplished together but to ignite national excitement about what lies ahead.

The Phase II expansion is not merely a company investment; it is a national breakthrough. It is a bold affirmation that Liberia can move beyond exporting raw materials to producing high-grade, value-added iron concentrate right here on Liberian soil. It is a signal to the world that Liberia is open for transformative business and serious about sustainable development.”

He added that this is the power of partnership, a partnership that over two decades has grown stronger through mutual trust, shared sacrifice, and the unwavering belief that Liberia’s future can, and will, be built by Liberians.

“We are talking about thousands of jobs created. Billions invested. Hundreds of Liberian businesses were empowered. Entire communities lifted. And an increase in national revenue from $35 million to over $125 million annually to support schools. clinics, roads, and opportunity”, CEO Kocken disclosed.",https://thenewdawnliberia.com/jepujef/2025/06/Acting-CEO-and-chief-of-operation-at-ArcelorMattal-Liberia-Anthony-P.-Kocken.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 03:09:55.574940

By Elizabeth Ireland, Times of San Diego

June 12, 2025 (San Diego County) -- More than 90 percent of voting United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 members at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions stores across San Diego County have authorized a strike if necessary, according to the union.

The vote, held June 8–11, comes amid ongoing contract negotiations between the union and grocery store parent companies Kroger and Albertsons.

The union, which represents more than 13,000 workers throughout San Diego and Imperial Counties, accuses the companies of unfair labor practices, including “surveillance, intimidation and retaliation,” during the months-long bargaining process.

“This strike authorization is not just a vote — it’s a mandate,” said Local 135 President Todd Walters. “We will not be pushed around or silenced. This vote shows that we are strong, united, and ready to do whatever it takes to win the fair contract you deserve.”

The bargaining committee has met with the companies 18 times since February, union officials said, but progress has stalled over issues such as staffing, wages and equity.

“I’ve been in every bargaining session,” said Cammy Fulton, a Ralphs worker and bargaining team member. “The companies aren’t taking us seriously. But this vote proves that we’re serious — and we’re not backing down.”

The final scheduled bargaining sessions are set for June 25–27.

More than 100,000 union grocery workers nationwide authorized a strike against Kroger and Albertsons last week. If called, it could become the largest grocery strike in modern history, disrupting operations during the industry’s peak summer season, according to Los Cerritos Community News.

In recent times, H&M has concentrated its efforts on simplifying and elevating its global offering.
In the first quarter of the financial year, H&M posted a moderate increase in sales of 3.10% to SEK 55,333 million (EUR 5,108 million).","H&M is intensifying its strategy to raise its positioning. The Swedish group, the world's number two fashion retailer, has made the leap, for the first time, to the French department store Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann. Through a shop-in-shop format dedicated to its H&M Adorables children's line, the fashion company and the iconic department store located just a few steps from the Opéra Garnier are creating synergies along the lines of the previous collaboration with Selfridges in London.

Surrounded by children's fashion brands such as Sergent Major or Mayoral and childcare references such as Moulin Roti or Stokke, H&M has set up its first space in the department store in the capital's 9th arrondissement. Located on the fifth floor of the Boulevard Haussmann department store, the 63-square-meter outlet is dedicated entirely to its high-end children's fashion line, Adorables, launched globally in October 2024.

This strategic opening also marks the line's second physical foray into France following its debut at H&M's flagship store on boulevard Haussmann. The proposal follows in the wake of the ephemeral corner that the Swedish giant launched several months ago at Selfridges in London, where the brand presented this line for the first time in a premium retail environment outside its own stores. For the moment, in Spain, the accessible premium line is only available through the brand's online store.

""The setting of Galeries Lafayette in Paris Haussmann is perfect to present this line to new customers,"" said Isabella Innergård, CEO of H&M Kids, underlining the importance of the city as a major fashion capital. ""We wanted to approach our customers and other different consumers with an unexpected and novel proposal, it is possible that for some it will be the first time they shop at H&M,"" she told Modaes about the potential access to new targets thanks to the newly opened Parisian location.

H&M surrounds itself with children's brands such as Mayoral and Sergent Major in its new corner.

Divided into two areas, one dedicated to babies and the other to children's clothing up to ten years old, the space offers a careful selection of eighty items with prices between 12.99 and 49.99 euros. ""We pay great attention to the fabrics, betting on materials, cashmere, silk and wool,"" said Innergård about the ambition to evolve the children's offer towards the high-end through design and a qualitative proposal.

""Sustainability is closely linked to the fabrics, but also to the lifespan and durability of the garments,"" continued the category's top manager on the ""strategic shift"" of the children's offering. In fact, H&M even aspires to link itself with the vintage universe. ""They are beautiful, well-cared-for garments that are appreciated, which gives them the value of wanting to keep them or inherit them; they are timeless designs destined to be passed on from one child to another,"" admitted Sofia Löfstedt, creative director of the children's line, underlining the pragmatic conception of garments such as bodysuits, which include buttoning extensions to last longer, accompanying the child's growth.

The corner, designed by H&M's in-house retail team, combines stone, wood and textiles to recreate a sophisticated and warm atmosphere, in line with the Swedish group's new visual language in its latest store renovations towards a high-end concept, such as in Westfield London, Stockholm or Seoul.

The company is immersed in a strategy to raise its brand positioning.

With this move, H&M is reinforcing its positioning in the premium segment, in a context of transformation of the group, which is committed to raising the level of its spaces, improving the design of its collections and expanding its presence in emblematic locations. The partnership with Galeries Lafayette, a benchmark in French retail, is part of this strategy to attract a more demanding customer without losing sight of its accessible identity, and comes against the backdrop of the Senate's approval of the anti-fast fashion law, which directly targets the practices of China Shein.

In recent times, H&M has concentrated its efforts on simplifying and elevating its global offering. ""We have optimized our assortment to strengthen the overall customer offering and fashion credentials with clearer, stronger andmore recognizablecollections and capsule collections,"" the company told Modaes during a recent visit to its Stockholm headquarters.

The main axes of change relate to product improvement, the overhaul of its store network and the transformation of the brand, combined with a simplification of its chains and the reorganization of its teams. The change, which began in the women's category, is taking shape this year in the men's and children's collections.

Present in France with a network of 168 stores, H&M boasts ambitious plans for the market, although the group does not detail sales by market or category. ""We want to target a more demanding clientele, both local and international, very attentive to fashion and product quality,"" said Manuel Da Cruz, Ile-de-France area manager for the Swedish group.

H&M's change began with its women's line and continues with its men's and children's lines.

The initiative is also part of an extensive store renovation plan in the Paris region, which includes key locations such as Forum des Halles. This store, the group's most profitable in the market, is in the process of remodeling and adapting its offer and will reopen its doors after the summer. In addition, the space upgrade plan will be completed by the end of the year, after having renovated the Beaugrenelle and Levallois spaces.

The Swedish company's latest ace up its sleeve is a strategic opening in Le Marais, one of Paris' trendiest neighborhoods, where it will open a permanent store in September with a focus on men's and women's fashion, as well as brand experience. The project follows an artistic pop-up store launched last year as a test, and confirms the group's desire to strengthen its presence in premium locations. The exact address of the store has not yet been confirmed.

In the first quarter of the financial year, H&M posted a moderate increase in sales of 3.10% to SEK 55,333 million (EUR 5,108 million). The company also posted a 53% drop in net profit to 53.5 million euros, affected by the unstable geopolitical context, increased investment and the impact of exchange rates.

Last week, the Persson family raised its control in the Swedish company's capital. The members of the founding saga of the fashion group took 70% of the company's capital and 85% of the voting rights, in a progressive takeover that could lead H&M to a future away from the stock market.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6ImRldjE3NDk3OTg2MDAifQ/files/2025/redaccion-empresas/hm/hm-corner-1200.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 03:10:02.293825

Last month, Ralph Lauren announced during a call with analysts that it planned to raise its prices in the coming months into next year.

While the move is in line with moves from other similar clothing brands responding to the tariffs that were recently imposed by the Donald Trump administration, it does not sound like that is the sole reason for Ralph Lauren's price increases.

As it turns out, the company was already planning to increase its prices even before the tariffs were announced as it moves forward with what appears to be a new brand identity.

During a recent call with analysts, Ralph Lauren Chief Financial Officer Justin Picicci explained that the brand was shifting its focus toward younger and more high-end customers who are less sensitive to price increases.

“We’ve been on this multi-year journey to shift our customer base towards less price-sensitive consumers, especially in the full-price channel,” Picicci said on a call with analysts according to the Wall Street Journal.

While this might not be good news for some consumers, it sounds like the brand has already had success with the strategy, reporting larger profits and a jump in revenue for the first three months of the year as a result of those higher prices and lower cotton costs.

With this success, Ralph Lauren is already planning to increase prices even more in the upcoming fall as well as next year's spring.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

Medtronic in May issued the recall notification related to specific Newport HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators and certain related Newport service parts.
The impacted Newport HT70 family of ventilators is intended to provide continuous or intermittent positive pressure mechanical ventilatory support.
Medtronic said it is not correcting these issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service affected ventilators.
Medtronic in February 2024 had announced its decision to exit its ventilator product lines, including the Newport ventilators.","(RTTNews) - Medical devices maker Medtronic plc has urged customers to discontinue clinical use of the recently recalled certain Newport branded ventilators and certain related service parts after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration upgraded it to a Class I recall.

According to the FDA, a Class I recall is the most serious type of recall, a situation where the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.

Medtronic in May issued the recall notification related to specific Newport HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators and certain related Newport service parts.

The impacted Newport HT70 family of ventilators is intended to provide continuous or intermittent positive pressure mechanical ventilatory support. HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators are intended for use by home users, as well as for infant and pediatric patients who may be at higher risks of injury or death due to unanticipated ventilator failures.

The recall was initiated after customer complaints, and the related probe identified two separate capacitors on one of the ventilator's controller Printed Circuit Board Assembly or PCBA. This, in case of failure, may result in the ventilator shutting down during use, or the shutdown alert alarm failing to sound effectively.

If a ventilator fails and does not provide adequate ventilation, the patient may not be able to breathe on their own, leading to low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide levels, and potentially severe consequences like brain injury or death.

There have been 63 medical device reports or MDRs associated with this issue, including two serious injuries and one death, the firm noted. The company added that no instances of both capacitors failing on the same PCBA board have occurred, nor are they anticipated to occur.

Medtronic said it is not correcting these issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service affected ventilators. Instead, the customers are asked to remove the affected devices from use and replace with an alternate means of ventilation.

The firm will continue working directly with the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world on the recall.

Medtronic in February 2024 had announced its decision to exit its ventilator product lines, including the Newport ventilators. As they wind down the business over the coming years, the company said it will continue to serve the existing ventilator contracts.",https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 05:11:36.685917

Publicis Groupe is launching a groundbreaking global campaign designed to be a live, undeniable demonstration of the power of creators, technology, and AI in achieving unprecedented reach and impact.

Launching on June 16th, the audacious campaign aims to prove that clients can achieve Super Bowl-level reach (over 127 million impressions) for a mere fraction of the cost, seamlessly integrated into their existing media mix. This will be made possible through Publicis' formidable influencer ecosystem, powered by Influential and Captiv8, which boasts a network of over 19 million creators and is further amplified by Epsilon’s robust data capabilities.

The ""unknown lion"" will be introduced through a joint Instagram post from top wildlife influencers @shandorlarenty (9.3M TikTok, 596K Instagram) and @Pubity (40M Instagram, 17M TikTok). From this initial spark, the activation will rapidly expand across Influential and Captiv8’s vast network, covering a staggering 90% of influencers with more than 1 million followers and 95% with over 5,000.

To provide real-time transparency and showcase the campaign's monumental growth, a ""Lion Tracker"" at Influential Beach will monitor the lion's escalating audience throughout the festival. By the close of Cannes Lions, this ""unknown lion"" is projected to have achieved ""big game"" reach, a powerful testament to Publicis' unique influencer platform.

Driving the point home with a playful yet pointed message, the program is backed by a digital OOH (Out-of-Home) campaign. These ads will humorously compare the cost of achieving Super Bowl-worthy influencer reach to common Cannes expenses – from a handful of business class tickets to a fraction of a beach party budget, or even a sliver of the awards entries some agencies submit.

Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Groupe, emphasized the strategic vision behind the initiative: “With every acquisition — from Captiv8 to Influential — and every innovation, like CoreAI, we’re building a future-ready platform to help clients navigate an increasingly complex and challenging marketing landscape. At Cannes this year, we’re focused on turning AI hype into business upside — with practical, Monday-ready solutions our clients can put to work immediately.”

Publicis Groupe's ""unknown lion"" campaign is set to be a highlight of Cannes Lions 2025, not just for its creative ingenuity but for its clear, demonstrable proof of how cutting-edge technology and a vast creator network can deliver unparalleled results for clients in today's dynamic marketing environment.",https://erp.adgully.com/artical_image/4512df292ce590768153217b3c208a3f.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 02:11:31.944433

CVS, which owns one of the nation's largest PBMs, Caremark, says the bill could force it to pull out of Louisiana entirely.
'If you choose to be a PBM, you can still be a PBM,' explained State Rep. Dustin Miller, who sponsored the bill.
The text blast from CVS — which has revamped management after a sales slump — didn't go over well with many legislators.
If they leave, they leave of their own volition because they don't truly care,' another person wrote.","Louisiana residents were left confused — and a little panicked — after CVS sent out ominous texts claiming the pharmacy giant may shut down every store in the state.

The messages, sent directly to customers' phones this morning, warned that 'your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist could lose their job' — sparking a wave of concern and confusion.

The alert was linked to House Bill 358, a new piece of legislation targeting Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) — the behind-the-scenes middlemen that help set drug prices and reimbursement rates.

CVS, which owns one of the nation's largest PBMs, Caremark, says the bill could force it to pull out of Louisiana entirely.

'If you choose to be a PBM, you can still be a PBM,' explained State Rep. Dustin Miller, who sponsored the bill. 'But you cannot be a PBM and a pharmacy.'

Lawmakers argue the measure is designed to stop big chains from steering customers toward their own stores — a move they say hurts independent pharmacies and inflates prices.

The text blast from CVS — which has revamped management after a sales slump — didn't go over well with many legislators.

'Scare tactics,' said Rep. Dixon McMakin, who slammed the company's messaging as misleading.

Others, like Rep. Edmond Jordan, tried to calm nerves: 'Independent pharmacies aren't going to close tomorrow. In fact, they're doing better than they have in years.'

'If CVS decides to leave, hopefully, we have people there to make up that difference.'

PBMs are used by pharmacies, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers when setting drug prices.

'They set the rates and the reimbursement for the pharmacies; we are just telling them if that is your core responsibility, you can keep that as your core responsibility,' Miller said.

'We don't want you to also go open a pharmacy and steer people to you and compete against other pharmacies.'

The text message fiasco comes after Arkansas signed Act 624 into a law banning PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies starting next year.

Reddit users were more blunt.

'CVS has one of the biggest PBM's and they don't want to give up all the price fixing they do. Let them leave. They will come crawling back,' a customer claimed on a post.

'Just got it myself as well at the email. Do not respond. If they leave, they leave of their own volition because they don't truly care,' another person wrote.

The bill, which has passed both the House and Senate, now awaits the signature of Governor Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign it into law. That is expected to be a formality.

The text message fiasco comes after Arkansas signed Act 624 into a law banning PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies starting next year.

CVS has been having financial problems over the last few years.

The chain announced back in 2023 that it would close 900 stores by the end of 2024.

The pharmacy chain revealed the closures were part of a 'retail footprint strategy' created in order to continue meeting customer needs.

CVS is planning to shutter 270 stores this year, but will continue operating over 9,000 locations nationwide.

It experienced a 7% increase in first quarter revenue compared to 2024 and has not filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

However, fellow pharmaceutical chain Rite Aid has been struggling to stay afloat after filing for bankruptcy in 2023.

It's set to close 111 stores across the US this year, and is in the process of selling its pharmacy assets following its second bankruptcy filing.

However, Anker is only recalling units sold in the US with qualifying serial numbers.
After confirming that your power bank is one of the recalled units, Anker says it should be taken to a facility that can safely dispose of lithium-ion batteries due to the risk of fire.
If you’ve been regularly using devices featuring lithium-ion batteries for a while, you’ll want to be mindful of issues like overheating or visible swelling and dispose of them properly if you think there’s a potential problem.","Anker has issued a recall for its PowerCore 10000 power bank (model A1263) due to a “potential issue with the lithium-ion battery” that could pose a fire safety risk. The company has received 19 reports of fires and explosions that have caused minor burn injuries and resulted in property damage totaling over $60,700, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC).

The recall covers about 1,158,000 units that were sold online through Amazon, Newegg, and eBay between June 2016 and December 2022. The affected batteries can be identified by the Anker logo engraved on the side with the model number A1263 printed on the bottom edge. However, Anker is only recalling units sold in the US with qualifying serial numbers. To check if yours is included, you’ll need to visit Anker’s website.

Anker is offering affected consumers their choice of either a $30 gift card (the recalled battery cost around $27) that can be used on Anker.com, or a free 10,000mAh Anker power bank as a replacement (model A1388) featuring upgrades including a charge level display and a USB-C charging cable lanyard.

To receive the gift card or the replacement, Anker requires a “photo of the power bank with the submission date and the word ‘recall’ or ‘recalled’ written clearly in permanent marker,” to be submitted, and a “photo showing the model number and serial number (SN) printed on the bottom of the device.” The company is also requesting a purchase receipt, but it’s not mandatory to participate in the recall.

After confirming that your power bank is one of the recalled units, Anker says it should be taken to a facility that can safely dispose of lithium-ion batteries due to the risk of fire. Those facilities can be found through the Environmental Protection Agency’s website or other organizations in the US that specialize in processing e-waste. Do not throw them in the trash, recycling bins, or used battery boxes provided at various retail locations.

The recall is also a reminder that power banks and backup batteries can potentially develop severe issues over time, as these particular units are almost a decade old. If you’ve been regularly using devices featuring lithium-ion batteries for a while, you’ll want to be mindful of issues like overheating or visible swelling and dispose of them properly if you think there’s a potential problem. And while the technology is currently more expensive than lithium-ion batteries, you can also consider upgrading to solid-state batteries which are more powerful, safer, and longer lasting than what we commonly use now to power our devices.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/anker_powercore1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-06-13 01:08:58.938303

Coffee drinkers have turned away from the chain in recent years, put off by high beverage prices, long wait times and impersonal experiences.
The plan will help address the major customer pet peeve of long wait times before getting their hands on a coffee.","Starbucks has launched its biggest hiring spree in history — aimed at finally tackling the number one gripe from frustrated customers.

The recruitment blitz— adding as many as 85,000 workers across its 17,000 US locations — is a bold move aimed at slashing long wait times.

Customers have grown weary of waiting 20 minutes for a drink, with many walking away from the chain entirely.

Soaring prices and what critics call a 'soulless' in-store experience have only added to the exodus — helping drive a sharp drop in sales.

New CEO Brian Niccol, speaking to 14,000 store managers at a Las Vegas event on Wednesday, called it 'the biggest human capital investment in connection in the history of Starbucks.'

He said the goal isn't just to speed up service, but to ease pressure on overworked employees and bring back the warmth and personal touch that once made Starbucks a beloved 'third place' between home and work.

'Your rosters are going to expand with this,' Niccol told managers, who can begin hiring from August.

Five years ago, Starbucks stores averaged 23 employees. Cost-cutting has since trimmed that number down to 18 to 19 — four to five fewer workers per location.

Restoring pre-Covid staffing levels would mean hiring between 68,000 and 85,000 people across all US stores.

Even focusing solely on the 11,000 company-owned locations, the increase would still be a massive 44,000 to 55,000 hires.

Jodi Love, a portfolio manager at T Rowe Price, a Starbucks shareholder, estimated the labor investments would add more than $1bn in additional spending to fiscal 2026.

But the move is expected to resonate with baristas on the frontlines, many of whom have long complained of chronic understaffing that fuels delays and drains morale.

The new hires are also expected to support Starbucks' efforts to bring back a more personal touch — including a new policy asking baristas to handwrite notes on customers’ cups.

Explaining the U-turn, Niccol told the Financial Times: 'We over-rotated on the idea of equipment and that replacing the humanity of service,' Niccol told the Financial Times.

'And I think service is our point of difference. Despite everybody saying they're more connected than ever, everything I read is people feel more lonely than ever.

'I think part of the problem is there aren't enough third places anymore.'

Niccol was hired last year in an effort to turn around the struggling chain.

Former CEO Howard Shultz agreed with Niccol telling Wednesday's company event 'we're not a company based on technology.

'That enables us, we're a company based on people.'

The former Chipotle boss has embarked on a series of plans to return Starbucks to its original 'third place between home and work' concept.

Coffee drinkers have turned away from the chain in recent years, put off by high beverage prices, long wait times and impersonal experiences.

Niccol has set about axing complicated drinks from Starbucks menus, asking staff to put messages on customer's coffee cups and scaling back promotions.

The plan will help address the major customer pet peeve of long wait times before getting their hands on a coffee.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/13/00/99308247-0-If_Starbucks_returned_to_pre_Covid_levels_that_would_see_another-a-41_1749769959050.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 01:08:34.549511

Critics of the message say it’s more than a warning; it’s a political campaign that may have crossed a legal line.
“So, they’re kind of like a Visa Card for prescriptions.” But Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill says CVS went too far by using private customer data for lobbying.
“CVS has cornered the market and used that market to run a lot of independent pharmacists out of business,” she said.
“The loss of independent pharmacies has been much more damaging to us than losing a large chain pharmacy like CVS,” Murrill said.","LOUISIANA (KLFY) — This week, CVS customers across Louisiana were met with an alarming text message:

“Last-minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy—your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job. Contact your elected officials to protect your access.”

The text, which quickly triggered confusion and concern, refers to House Bill 358—a late-session proposal that would ban pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like CVS Caremark from owning or controlling pharmacies in the state.

Critics of the message say it’s more than a warning; it’s a political campaign that may have crossed a legal line.

“People give their information to health care providers to provide patient information for the betterment of their health,” said former state senator and pharmacist Fred Mills. “I don’t know if they give this information for political purposes.”

PBMs act as a middleman between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Supporters of the bill argue that this dual role (particularly when companies like CVS own both the PBM and the pharmacy) creates a conflict of interest and limits consumer choice.

“If you work for a company that decides you’ll pay $5 or $10 for your prescriptions, the PBM implements that plan,” Mills said. “So, they’re kind of like a Visa Card for prescriptions.”

But Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill says CVS went too far by using private customer data for lobbying.

“They were sending out information using people’s personal cell phone numbers to lobby against legislation that they didn’t like,” Murrill said. “That is not the purpose for which they obtained our personal information.”

In response, Murrill says her office has issued a cease-and-desist letter and opened an investigation into whether CVS violated the state’s Unfair Trade Practices Act.

“CVS has cornered the market and used that market to run a lot of independent pharmacists out of business,” she said. “It’s also running up our costs of medication.”

In a public statement, CVS claimed the legislation would force the company to close 119 pharmacies in Louisiana, impacting one million patients and nearly 2,700 employees. But Murrill and other state officials argue the company’s messaging is misleading.

“The loss of independent pharmacies has been much more damaging to us than losing a large chain pharmacy like CVS,” Murrill said. “It is so damaging to our rural communities. And they have been decidedly persistent in putting them out of business.”

The bill did not pass despite pressure from Governor Landry. If Governor Landry does call a special session, it would most likely happen in August.

Fed FOMC, BoE, BoJ meetings and mainland China data in focus

Central bank meetings will be in abundance in the coming week, including in the US, UK and Japan, while inflation figures in the UK and Japan will be scrutinized alongside activity data from both the US and mainland China.

The Fed policymakers gather for the June FOMC meeting. Despite additional political pressure by President Donald Trump to lower rates and a lower-than-anticipated CPI report, US central bankers are widely expected to keep Fed fund rates unchanged in the near-term. Inflation remains above target at 2.4% and uncertainty about the potential impact of tariffs on prices remains a major concern at the Fed, all while the labour market continues to show encouraging resilience. The next move by the Fed nonetheless likely remains a cut, with money managers widely expecting up to 50 basis points of cuts in the second half of 2025, according to the latest June S&P Global Investment Manager Index (IMI). While the IMI survey has also indicated that the political environment remains the biggest drag on equities in the near-term, fiscal and monetary policy are acting as additional drags. As such, the Fed's stance will be closely watched for insights into the interest rate outlook and what may be a trigger for rate cuts.

A clearer bias towards the lowering of interest rates is meanwhile observed for the UK. Subdued growth conditions and softening inflationary pressures, according to May's UK PMI data, point to further rate cuts by the Bank of England, though it may not be until August when we see them move again, after having just lowered the Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% in May. The August cut is also likely to be followed by a further cut in November.

Meanwhile in APAC, the Bank of Japan faces greater challenges in their rate hike resolve amid signs of deteriorating economic trends. A near-stalling of growth has been signalled in May as US trade policy uncertainty dampened global trade. The impact was not limited to Japan, however, as APAC economies broadly experienced a slowdown in growth as export orders fell at an increased rate, according to PMI indications. To gain further insights into the impact of trade disruptions, mainland China's industrial production and retail sales figures will be in focus, while Japan also refreshes trade and inflation numbers for May.

PMI-based central bank indicators point to a further rate cuts in the UK while the bias is becoming less clear in the US, albeit temporarily as an inventory build-up buoy growth.

What to watch in the coming week

Americas: Fed meeting, US retail sales, industrial production, building permits and housing starts data; BCB meeting; Canada retail sales

June's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting unfolds midweek with the consensus pointing to no change in Fed rates at the mid-year meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market has priced in the next rate cut only towards the end of the year. Concerns over intensifying tariff-related inflationary pressures, coupled with a resilient labour market, as shown by the latest May S&P Global US PMI data and confirmed by the official labour market update, mean a rate cut only looks likely later in the year.

On the data front, US retail sales and industrial production figures will be key indicators to monitor, in addition to housing market updates. A solid rise in services activity contrasted with falling manufacturing production in May, according to PMI indications, and points to the likelihood of positive retail sales performance.

Central bankers similarly gather in Brazil to update monetary policy settings, with another hike not ruled out at present amid elevated inflation. That said, subdued growth conditions in May, according to the S&P Global Brazil PMI, add to the uncertainty for the interest rate outlook.

EMEA: BoE meeting, UK inflation, retail sales; Germany ZEW index; Eurozone trade data

Central bank meetings unfold in the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden in the week ahead. While the Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold according to consensus, the bias remains towards lowering rates on the back of subdued growth conditions and softening inflationary pressures, as seen via May's UK PMI update. Official UK inflation numbers will be due on Wednesday for an assessment of the latest CPI trend.

APAC: BoJ meeting, Japan inflation and trade data; mainland China activity data; Australia employment data; New Zealand GDP; BI, BSP, CBC meetings

A major central bank meeting also takes place in Japan, albeit with the Bank of Japan expected to hold its policy stance until later in the year. Key economic release includes Japan's inflation and trade, while a slew of activity figures will also be out from mainland China. Amid more subdued manufacturing sector conditions signalled by the Caixin PMI data, the industrial production numbers will be watched, while accelerating services activity growth hint at improvements for retail sales.

Australia meanwhile updates employment numbers and New Zealand releases first quarter GDP. Central bank meetings also take place in Indonesia, Philippines and Taiwan.

ID22,J&J,2025-06-13 02:54:09+00:00,Healthcare Brew,Johns Hopkins researchers warn drug tariffs could worsen shortages - Healthcare Brew,Caroline Catherman,,,,,https://www.healthcare-brew.com/stories/2025/06/12/johns-hopkins-researchers-drug-tariffs-worsen-shortages,"For generic drugs, tariffs could increase supply shortages.
For branded drugs—which make up 20% of prescriptions but 80% of prescription drug spending—tariffs could increase prices.
“For these products, the biggest problem is not cost, but it’s actually supply shortages,” she said.
About 62% of drug shortages from 2013–2017 were related to quality issues, the agency said in a 2019 report.
Branded drug manufacturers have moved from the US to places like Switzerland, Ireland, and Germany over the last couple decades because those countries offer better tax policies, he said.","With tariffs on the way “very shortly” for imported drugs, pharma giants like Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson are investing billions into expanding US manufacturing.

On the surface, it seems like tariffs are accomplishing the promised goal of bringing manufacturing back to the US. In an April 2 briefing, the White House vowed this increase would strengthen supply chains, lower costs, and reduce dependence on “foreign adversaries.”

But Baltimore, Maryland-based Johns Hopkins researchers said in a June 11 media briefing they don’t think tariffs will bring much benefit. For generic drugs, tariffs could increase supply shortages. For branded drugs—which make up 20% of prescriptions but 80% of prescription drug spending—tariffs could increase prices.

The deets. Only about 12% of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) volume is made in the US, excluding IV fluids, according to an April report by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), an independent nonprofit that sets global drug quality and safety standards.

“It would take years” to build up enough US manufacturing capacity to end reliance on other countries for certain branded drugs, Jeromie Ballreich, an associate research professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said during the briefing.

Plus, because domestic manufacturers import active pharmaceutical ingredients and key starting materials to make their drugs, manufacturing drugs here doesn’t necessarily dodge potential tariffs, Mariana Socal, an associate professor in the same department, said.

“We would expect pharma to pass the cost on to the insurers, and we would expect insurers to pass the cost on to the individual patients,” Ballreich said.

Already, the US pays more for branded drugs—sometimes 2x–4x more—than other countries, according to 2021 data from the Government Accountability Office.

Generic problems. Generic drugs are a different story.

The US pays about the same or less than other countries for these drugs, Socal said.

“For these products, the biggest problem is not cost, but it’s actually supply shortages,” she said.

If it becomes more expensive to import generics, she added, manufacturers might be tempted to “cut corners” on safety, since these drugs already have such low profit margins.

The FDA, which regularly inspects manufacturing facilities, could end up pausing imports from certain plants in response, exacerbating shortages. About 62% of drug shortages from 2013–2017 were related to quality issues, the agency said in a 2019 report.

How to fix things. On the other hand, the researchers said there are legitimate concerns about relying on other countries for drugs and a need for supply chain reform.

“Having access to prescription drugs is a national security matter,” Socal said. “I think that’s part of the rationale for bringing manufacturing back to US soil.”

But to do so requires more than tariffs: It demands a well-trained workforce alongside policies that make it attractive to set up shop in the country, Ballreich said.

Branded drug manufacturers have moved from the US to places like Switzerland, Ireland, and Germany over the last couple decades because those countries offer better tax policies, he said. (The European Union manufactures 43% of API for US brand-name prescriptions, USP found.)

To bring the manufacturers back, the US needs to offer tax policies that can compete.

He pointed to the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which used tax credits and grants to tempt more companies to move semiconductor manufacturing back to the country.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/878a62c685f591d3315ab7fde50ad6ee3d1379d9-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-06-13 03:10:06.903442

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.","BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.

Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.

As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care – the consequences would be dire.”

Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.

“It's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,” he said. “They’ve now taken that to send me political texts.”

CVS sent messages to “large numbers"" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.

Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information “for their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,” Murrill told reporters. “That’s not why anybody gave them their phone number.”

Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.

The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee — a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.

“We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,” Thibault said in an email. “Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.”

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.

The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.

Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.

“CVS … you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,” Landry said.

The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.

Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.

“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,"" Landry said a statement. ""It’s that important.”

The coffee chain's new strategy follows its struggles with continuous sales declines and slower store traffic over the last few quarters.

To return business to growth, Starbucks developed the ""Back to Starbucks"" turnaround plan, which included optimizing operations, prioritizing coffee quality, and simplifying its menu.

In the last several months, Starbucks (SBUX) reintroduced condiment bars and ceramic mugs for in-house sipping, brought back handwritten notes on to-go cups and bags to foster better customer connections, and returned the free in-café refills to make its coffee shops feel more like homes.

To increase efficiency, the coffee giant also refreshed its menu with a simpler version, discontinuing 13 items and eliminating extra charges for milk alternatives.

Starbucks makes major changes in its business with a turnaround plan

Starbucks has even gone beyond tweaking the store experience and menu. The chain will close underperforming shops to invest in building new locations and revamping old ones, encouraging customers to stay longer.

And just last month, Starbucks implemented a new dress code for its baristas across all North American stores to enhance its iconic green apron, marking its first update in nearly a decade.

Now, the coffee giant is making another change regarding its baristas, and this one requires a significant investment.

Starbucks increases investment in its workforce

Starbucks is expanding its workforce by adding at least one full-time assistant store manager to most company-operated stores nationwide beginning this fall.

This move aims to streamline the operation of its stores and improve the overall customer experience by providing staff with the support and help they need, ensuring a consistent leadership presence during operating hours.

Although anyone may apply for the full-time assistant store manager role, Starbucks wants to encourage its employees to put their best foot forward by supporting career growth and hiring 90% of the new leadership roles internally.

Currently, approximately 20% of Starbucks stores have an assistant store manager, with most being short-term.

The hiring process will be multiphased, with the first phase happening this September across six Starbucks districts. This initial step will help the company test the initiative and eventually have a full-time assistant store manager in most of its company-operated coffee shops by 2026.

Canada will be the next region to follow this process, beginning in summer 2026.

But booming demand for help in processing foreign goods has made these services more expensive, adding another cost to the tariff burden, industry players told Reuters.

AI Brief

Customs brokers are raising fees and boosting staff due to complex new US tariffs and increased paperwork.

Major firms like FedEx, DHL, Nike, and Amazon are expanding trade compliance teams to navigate changing trade rules.

Unpredictable tariff hikes are causing confusion, import delays, and heavier reliance on brokers across the US trade ecosystem.

Customs brokerages, until recently an anonymous branch of the import ecosystem, handle the paperwork needed to process shipments and calculate tariff bills. Mom-and-pop brokers interviewed by Reuters say they are raising fees, while major logistics firms like Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx and Germany-based DHL are also adding staff to their customs compliance teams.

Market research firms ballpark customs brokering as a roughly $5 billion industry in the United States. Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of U.S. tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.

Independent brokers like Laredo, Texas-based JD Gonzalez are fielding dozens of questions daily from concerned clients struggling to understand what they may owe to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and whether to go ahead with shipments or hold off.

Brokers are also spending more time and labor on customs forms than ever, and have in some cases implemented new IT systems.

“With all the new information we have to process, some of the automation we've used has been thrown out, so there’s more work to do,” said JD Gonzalez, who is also president of custom brokerage trade group NCBFAA.

The trend is part of a broader wave of corporate efforts to bolster trade compliance operations. Major companies, from Nike to Amazon to Lowe’s, had published job postings as of Wednesday for trade and customs professionals.

Nike was seeking a “lead” for trade and customs, who would “play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our trade compliance framework,” according to the post on Nike’s careers website. Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 U.S. customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website. Lowe's had three.

Nike, Amazon and Lowe’s did not respond to requests for comment.

HIGHER FEES

Independent brokers often base their fees on the number of codes they must enter to classify the contents of a given shipment. Known as harmonized tariff schedule codes, these line items help border officials distinguish car parts from children's toys, and determine proper tariff rates.

Prior to Trump's frenetic tariff policies, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code. But Gonzalez said the extra costs brokers have incurred as they ramp up systems to handle the tariff changes have led some to increase fees by $1 to $5 per code.

Gonzalez said he has raised fees “nominally,” while Steve Bozicevic, CEO of A&A Customs Brokers headquartered in Seattle and Vancouver, said his company added $3 per product type being imported into the U.S. because of merchandise facing ""tariff stacking,"" a phrase used when an item faces multiple tariffs.

""We raised the rates for the U.S. because of the new and added complexity,"" Bozicevic said. The company has not raised rates for imports into Canada because there's ""no new complexity,"" he said.

United Parcel Service UPS.N raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin. The move was part of general rate increases and unrelated to changes in tariffs, a UPS spokesperson told Reuters. FedEx's logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by 4% in January, according to a company spokesperson.

These bigger logistics companies, which include brokerage services in their broader shipping offerings, are also beefing up staff. DHL has upped headcount on its U.S. customs entry team by 30% since February, according to a spokesperson for the company’s DHL Express shipping unit.

FedEx had more than 40 open job postings on its customs and trade teams as of Tuesday, mainly based in the U.S., according to its LinkedIn jobs page. UPS had 10 similar U.S. positions open, according to its jobs website.

FedEx is ""adjusting our network to meet demand"" in an evolving tariff landscape, which ""includes hiring additional customs brokerage roles,"" the spokesperson said. UPS declined to comment on the job postings.

Historically, tariff changes have been less frequent, say brokers, trade lawyers and other trade professionals, and they have come with weeks of lead time, allowing brokers to prepare for the change and provide logistical feedback to CBP.

Compare that to last week's doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, which Trump announced abruptly, forcing the U.S. customs department to quickly publish official guidance just hours ahead of a midnight change.

""Many brokers clear shipments ahead of time, so then you have to come back and retroactively redo it and fix it,"" said Miami-based customs broker Ralph De La Rosa, whose company, Imperial Freight Brokers, was founded by his father 54 years ago.

Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.

Importers slowed shipments into the United States after Trump’s massive tariff announcement on April 2, after having frontloaded purchases earlier in the year to get ahead of an expected rise in duties.

Imports of consumer goods, which include cell phones and other household items, decreased $68.9 billion to $277.9 billion in April from a month before, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Trump announced additional tariffs on steel and aluminum in June and in May threatened to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union.

Adding to the uncertainty, a federal appellate court on Tuesday ruled that sweeping tariffs may remain in effect while appeals proceed, after a trade court ruled that the U.S. president overstepped his executive powers and blocked the duties. The appellate scheduled arguments for July 31.",https://img.astroawani.com/2025-06/61749635232_YantianportinShen.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:06:41.959146

In the small town where I live, there are several small grocery stores and not a single supermarket. While the stores' offerings and prices are similar, the overall shopping experience is not.

One store has a lot of polite employees who are always smiling, always kind, and very helpful. The other, you guessed it, is quite the opposite. When cashiers scan the items at the register in the second store, instead of gently placing them down, they almost break them.

While that is rude, I can’t blame everything on the workers, because the second store is hugely understaffed, and the management just won’t allow for more employees. Logically, they have a much smaller profit margin than the first store mentioned.

This story repeats itself all over the world, and sometimes the problem escalates. In the U.S. this year, there have been several huge boycotts at various retailers and grocery stores.

Recently, the retail giant Walmart experienced a nationwide customer boycott, organized by The People's Union USA, over the retailer’s alleged contribution to economic corruption. Then customers boycotted Target and Dollar General over DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) rollbacks.

Now, another supermarket chain is about to join this alarming trend.

Safeway and Albertsons workers reject the latest offer, intend to strike

The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 rejected the latest offer from Safety and Albertsons (ACI) and delivered 72-hour notice that its employees plan to terminate their current contract extension and go on strike.

“We took this decision very seriously and concluded that after so many months of bargaining, Safeway/Albertsons was giving us no choice but to further escalate our contract campaign,” stated Ivan Lopez, a Safeway distribution center worker in Denver.

Over the last few weeks, Safeway/Albertsons grocery store workers in Colorado pushed for an unfair labor practice strike to address the company’s perceived failure to negotiate fairly with employees and resolve understaffing at the state’s major grocers.

UFCW Local 7 President Kim Cordova said that Safeway/Albertsons have been working with KingSoopers and City Market, asking their employees to take less in health care and retirement benefits, and even cutting benefits for retirees.

The Union also highlighted that the two largest traditional grocery chains in the U.S., Kroger and Albertsons, have seen record profits over the last few years and have given billions of dollars to Wall Street investors.

What workers want is for these chains to invest more of those funds in the store, to lower prices for consumers and improve working conditions for employees.

One of the biggest strikes in Colorado’s history may start June 15

After nine months of negotiations, the bargaining fell through on June 11, and workers delivered a 72-hour notice requirement. That means the extension agreement can be terminated on Saturday at 7:42 p.m.

The countdown has begun, the Union said, adding that while the strike was not officially announced, it could begin as early as midnight on June 15.

In late May and early June, Safeway/Albertsons workers in Metro Denver, Boulder, Broomfield, Castle Rock, Conifer, Estes Park, Evergreen, Fountain, Grand Junction, Idaho Springs, Parker, Pueblo, Salida, Steamboat Springs, and Vail all voted to support an unfair labor practices strike by 99%.

Back in February, UFCW Local 7 members at Kroger-owned King Soopers struck for 10 days, hoping that Safeway/Albertsons would learn from it and reach a deal with its workers.

If the strike happens, around 7,000 workers might be involved, making it one of the biggest labor actions in The Centennial State’s history and the second-biggest this year, writes the Denver Post.

What’s more, there are about 150,000 UFCW and Teamster workers in Colorado, Washington, and California negotiating new contracts, suggesting that the strike in Colorado could lead to major labor action at retail giants.

Although the US and China reached a 90-day truce in their ongoing tariff war in May, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US are still subject to tariffs of as much as 3,521 per cent, with Washington citing unfair trade practices such as subsidies and dumping for the high levies.

“The industry used to say that you either go overseas or exit the game,” said Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar, one of the world’s largest solar-panel manufacturers, at the SNEC PV+ Photovoltaic Power Conference and Exhibition in Shanghai. “Now, due to tariffs, simply exporting isn’t enough; you must also localise production abroad.”

The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing store workers announced on Monday that members have voted overwhelmingly in favor, giving their leaders authority to call a strike.

A walkout would cause a major disruption for two of the nation’s largest grocery chains during the busiest season of the year. Kroger and Albertsons are the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons and Pavilions grocery stores.

The last major Southern California grocery strike in 2003 and 2004 roiled the region’s supermarkets, paving the way for new chains. Another strike was averted during a standoff in 2022.

The vote comes fourth months after contract negotiations between the union and the grocery chain companies began. The workers’ contracts expired March 2.

In the statement, the bargaining committee of UFCW Locals 324 and 770 said: “Our message is clear: we are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve.”

In an email statement, Courtney Carranza, director of communications and public affairs for Southern California Division at Albertsons, said: “We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers, and allows our company to remain competitive.”

A representative of Kroger did not respond to a request for comment.

The strike authorization vote was held in the first two weeks of June, the union said. It did not disclose the results.

Negotiations are scheduled to resume on June 25.

Among the chief sticking points in the talks is staffing levels, with the union contending that a staffing shortage has hurt service and working conditions.

“The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal’, downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily,” the union said in its statement. “At the same time, the companies have broken labor laws by engaging in unlawful surveillance, interrogation of members at actions, threats, and retaliation for union activity. This is unacceptable.”

(KNWA/KFTA) — CVS Health is ramping up its campaign against a new Arkansas law that targets pharmacy benefit managers, publicly clashing with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders just hours after she defended the legislation in a guest essay for The New York Times.

Act 624, signed by Sanders in April, bars companies from running both a pharmacy and a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), a model used by CVS. PBMs manage prescription drug benefits for insurers, negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and reimburse pharmacies.

In her guest essay on June 10, Sanders wrote that PBMs “forcibly steer patients away from independent operators” and inflate drug prices. She also wrote that Act 624 lets PBMs keep operating in Arkansas, but, she said, “they just can’t continue to mistreat patients and box out other pharmacies.”

Sanders claimed the three largest pharmacy benefit managers handle 80% of U.S. prescriptions and earn 70% of specialty drug revenue through their affiliated pharmacies.

“Now, CVS is threatening to close down every pharmacy it operates in our state — preferring to take its ball and go home rather than divest from its pharmacy benefit management business and actually serve the patients it claims to care about,” Sanders wrote.

CVS issued a statement later that day disputing Sanders’ characterization of the law, claiming that the new law is about “choosing winners and losers and rewarding special interests.”

“Out-of-state competitors are disadvantaged,” a CVS spokesperson said. “In-state competitors, including Walmart, would handsomely benefit from the closures of pharmacies owned by us and others. The losers are the people of Arkansas who will pay more.”

CVS says the law could force it to close 23 pharmacies in Arkansas, affecting 340,000 patients, and block its specialty pharmacy from treating 10,000 high-risk patients with cancer, HIV and rare diseases.

The company is also challenging Act 624 in federal court, arguing it violates the U.S. Constitution.

“PBMs are the last line of defense between drugmakers that want to charge a lot of money, and the American businesses, unions, health plans, and government agencies that want to provide good benefits to people,” CVS said in its response on June 10.

CVS argues the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly targets out-of-state businesses, treats similar companies differently, and conflicts with federal laws like ERISA and Medicare rules. The company also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

“One state representative who co-sponsored this law owns 13 pharmacies by himself,” the company said, linking to state Rep. Brandon Achor’s campaign website.

Act 624, introduced as House Bill 1150, was backed by the Arkansas Pharmacists Association and Attorney General Tim Griffin, and passed easily.

Act 624 is scheduled to take effect January 1, 2026.",https://www.nwahomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2025/06/Untitled-10.png?w=1280,N,,2025-06-12 22:45:31.911269

“Today’s announcement for Grillo’s Pickles confirms our strategy.” Grillo’s Pickles is investing $54 million to construct and outfit a 155,000-sq.-ft. food manufacturing facility and will employ up to 150 people.
“Our pickles use a century-old family recipe and contain no artificial preservatives,” says Adam Kaufman, president and CEO of Boston-based Grillo’s Pickles.
“Grillo’s Pickles are packed, shipped and sold refrigerated.
“As a company, Grillo’s Pickles is known for their refreshingly unique pickle products, along with their fun and very distinctive marketing efforts,” Goecker says.","The company that invites customers to “Chill Out, Eat a Pickle” has officially confirmed its plans for a new, $54 million food manufacturing operation to meet its growing national demand from a site near Columbus, Ind. Grillo’s Pickles recently broke ground on a 155,000-sq.-ft. production facility along I-65 in Bartholomew County, Ind. The Taylorsville, Ind., facility in northern Bartholomew County will be adjacent to a previously announced $175 million King’s Hawaiian bakery operation. Both companies are subsidiaries of Irresistible Foods Group (IFG).

“When we purchased the Bartholomew County site, we did so with thoughts about building it out in phases,” says Joe Leonardo, vice president of strategic operations for Irresistible Foods Group and chief operating officer for King’s Hawaiian. “Today’s announcement for Grillo’s Pickles confirms our strategy.”

Grillo’s Pickles is investing $54 million to construct and outfit a 155,000-sq.-ft. food manufacturing facility and will employ up to 150 people. It is adjacent to the previously announced 300,000-sq.-ft. bakery facility for King’s Hawaiian.

“Our pickles use a century-old family recipe and contain no artificial preservatives,” says Adam Kaufman, president and CEO of Boston-based Grillo’s Pickles. “Grillo’s Pickles are packed, shipped and sold refrigerated. For our new production site, it was important to us to find a central U.S. location with a skilled workforce and supportive business environment, and we are very excited to be in Bartholomew County, Ind.”

Local government leaders expressed support for IFG’s two projects. In November 2023, Bartholomew County officials pledged up to $3,746,000 from a combination of County Rainy Day Fund and County Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT) funds to pay for off-site water, sewer and road improvement upgrades to serve the project site and surrounding area. Last June, county officials unanimously approved the company’s request for an additional 10-year property tax phase-in on the Grillo’s Pickles building and equipment, producing savings of approximately $1.2 million.

“Bartholomew County, Ind., is committed to growing and diversifying our local economy, and we are exceptionally pleased to support and welcome Grillo’s to our community as an important part of our local strategy to attract food manufacturing,” says County Commissioner Tony London.

According to Kristen Goecker, interim president of Greater Columbus Economic Development Corporation, regional leaders have also approved inclusion of up to $1 million from Indiana’s READI 2.0 funds awarded to the South Central Indiana Talent Region. The funds will support intersection improvements at US-31 and Bear Lane, along with the extension of County Road 700N on the southern edge of the project site, in support of the Taylorsville Industrial Park.

“As a company, Grillo’s Pickles is known for their refreshingly unique pickle products, along with their fun and very distinctive marketing efforts,” Goecker says. “As such, Grillo’s is going to fit in perfectly well in a community that is known for being different by design, with a manufacturing workforce that is second to none.”

Bartholomew County Council president Leah Beyer also voiced her support of the project.

“This project represents economic development teamwork at its finest,” Beyer says. “County Planning & Zoning, County Council, the Board of Commissioners, City of Columbus officials, local utilities and our READI Regional Group have all pulled in the same direction to support the investments pledged by IFG, King’s Hawaiian and Grillo’s Pickles.”

In addition to local incentives, based on the company’s investment and job creation plans, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation committed an investment in Grillo’s Pickles of up to $1.4 million in the form of incentive-based tax credits. These tax credits are performance-based, meaning that the company is eligible to claim the incentives once Hoosiers are hired.",https://www.foodengineeringmag.com/ext/resources/2025/06/12/Grillos-Pickles-Logo-1170.jpg?height=635&t=1749751328&width=1200,N,,2025-06-12 22:51:52.729817

Bill would have banned ownership of both drug stores and pharmacy benefit managers

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

CVS texts included a draft letter opposing the bill

The company’s text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care – the consequences would be dire.”

Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.

A GOP lawmaker received one of the texts

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.

“It’s in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,” he said. “They’ve now taken that to send me political texts.”

CVS sent messages to “large numbers” of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company’s pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.

Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information “for their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,” Murrill told reporters. “That’s not why anybody gave them their phone number.”

Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.

The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee — a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.

“We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,” Thibault said in an email. “Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.”

Landry says he may call special session

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state’s legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.

The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.

Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS’s lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn’t be able to access their medications.

“CVS … you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,” Landry said.

The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.

Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.

“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,” Landry said a statement. “It’s that important.”

United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 7 represents 7,000 Safeway/ Albertsons employees across Colorado. The union and the company have spent the past few months working to reach an agreement on wages, staffing levels and benefits.

In a release, the union said a negotiating session Wednesday ""did not generate a breakthrough,"" so leaders decided to give the company a 72-hour strike notice. UFCW Local 7 members who have already voted to strike could begin as early as Sunday.

Union leaders said they did make a final offer to the company to avoid a strike. That officer will expire at 5 p.m. on Friday.

UFCW Local 7 terminates contract extension with Safeway, gives strike notice

Sydney Isenberg

Denver7 reached out to UFCW Local 7 president Kim Cordova multiple times Thursday for a comment and interview, but did not hear back as of the publication of this article. A different representative with the union told Denver7 that out of the 81 union Safeway stores in Colorado, approximately 45 could strike.

For shoppers like LaVette Noel, the potential for a strike at her local Safeway is a massive blow.

""My feelings are hurt because I like Safeways,"" Noel said. ""You know, King Soopers, Safeway, I choose Safeways right now in my life.""

Noel told Denver7 she visits the Safeway location in Denver's Five Points neighborhood multiple times a week. She said news of the impending strike gives her major pause over continuing to shop there.

""I want them to get whatever they're asking for or want because they work hard for their money, and I think they deserve whatever they're asking for,"" Noel said of Safeway employees.

Chris Sharits is also a loyal Safeway shopper. He often picks up DoorDash grocery store orders from the Five Points location.

""I get a lot of these, so, you know, almost 3,000 shopping orders of my 13,700 some lifetime deliveries, which I started during the shutdown,"" Sharits said. ""If this store is on strike, I won't pass the strike. I won't go over the strikers.""

A spokesperson for Safeway/ Albertsons declined an interview but did offer a statement, which states, ""We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers, and allows our company to remain competitive.""

While shoppers understand what's happening, they told Denver7 they are not happy with what's possibly to come.

""That's just the way I'll handle it is I just won't take the orders,"" Sharits said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6d2f736/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+76/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2F40%2Fdd046043496e8996da6a5dd0570a%2Fimg-3350.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:04:41.824035

And I’m leaving inspired, energized and ready to lead forward.
That moment wasn’t just about recognition—it was about showing what’s possible when we stay close to the work and lead with intention.
LE25 reminded me that leadership isn’t about having all the answers.
I’m not just leading a team — I’m building a community where everyone feels empowered to deliver their best.","After 17 years with Starbucks, I’ve seen a lot — store closures, transformations and everything in between. But LE25 was something special. It wasn’t just a celebration of where we’ve been; it was a launchpad for where we’re going. And I’m leaving inspired, energized and ready to lead forward.

What stood out most to me over these two days was the clarity of purpose. There’s no secret formula to success here — it’s about living our values, showing up for each other and creating a space where both partners and customers feel seen. That’s what I’m bringing back to my store in Illinois.

One of the most powerful moments for me was hearing Mellody Hobson speak. Her story — her presence — was deeply moving. As a woman and a person of color, her journey from not having a seat at the table to becoming a leader who’s always had partners at heart reminded me that anything is possible. She’s been with us through so much, and her commitment to this company is inspiring.

And then there was Howard. Seeing him on stage alongside Brian Niccol, both aligned in their message, was incredibly grounding. It reminded me that we don’t need to reinvent who we are — we just need to lead with connection and care. That alignment gave me confidence that we’re on the right path.

Being on stage as part of the Starting Five was surreal. I never imagined I’d be in that position, representing the work we’ve done and the direction we’re heading. It was an honor to stand beside other store managers and leaders like our coo Mike Grams, who truly listens and cares about what’s happening in our stores. That moment wasn’t just about recognition—it was about showing what’s possible when we stay close to the work and lead with intention.

I’ve already started doing the work with my team — owning our business, setting clear expectations and building a culture of accountability. But now, I’m thinking about how to elevate that. I plan to connect with every partner one-on-one and share what I experienced. I want them to know how important they are to our success and how much I need them with me on this journey. We all have to be all in.

Green Apron Service helped us see what’s possible when we focus on excellence at every point of connection. With the right labor and the right mindset, we created a better partner experience, which led to a better customer experience. It wasn’t about doing more — it was about doing what matters, with intention. LE25 reminded me that leadership isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about being present, staying curious and creating space for others to grow. That’s what I’m taking back to my store. I’m not just leading a team — I’m building a community where everyone feels empowered to deliver their best.

We’re moving forward with purpose. And I’m ready.",https://about.starbucks.com/uploads/2025/06/Image-2.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 01:08:45.067161

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state’s legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.

The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.

Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS’s lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn’t be able to access their medications.

“CVS … you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,” Landry said.

The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.

Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.

“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,” Landry said a statement. “It’s that important.”

(AP) — Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.

Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.

As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.

Bill would have banned ownership of both drug stores and pharmacy benefit managers

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

CVS texts included a draft letter opposing the bill

READ:

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care – the consequences would be dire.”

Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.

A GOP lawmaker received one of the texts

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.

“It's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,” he said. “They’ve now taken that to send me political texts.”

CVS sent messages to “large numbers"" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.

Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information “for their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,” Murrill told reporters. “That’s not why anybody gave them their phone number.”

Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.

The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee — a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.

“We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,” Thibault said in an email. “Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.”

They did the most brand PR work for us within the U.S. and wider North America.
We will work with The Weber Shandwick Collective collaboratively.
Any comment on how this will affect Mars’ agency relationships?
Why did you pick The Weber Shandwick Collective?","In January 2026, Mars will launch a new agency model globally across its Snacking and Petcare businesses.

Interpublic Group’s The Weber Shandwick Collective will handle earned media; and Publicis Groupe will have oversight of media production, connected commerce, paid influencer and paid social work. Creative will continue to be handled by Omnicom’s BBDO and DDB.

PRWeek’s Diana Bradley sat down with Andy Pharoah, VP of corporate affairs and sustainability at Mars, to find out more about why the company reworked its agency roster.

What inspired Mars to make this change now?

This isn't just about an agency win or loss. This is about a completely different approach to building brands in which ‘earned first’ takes a massive role.

This is a very strategic shift. The reality is, 50% of reach to consumers is not ad-funded. If you look at Gen Z, 73% of its purchases are influenced by friends, communities and influencers. This is a complete pivot in terms of how we think about marketing, and, for the first time, adapting an earned-first approach. We have never had an agency doing what we are looking for [The Weber Shandwick Collective] to do in support of our brands, covering all of our consumer brands globally. This is about remaining relevant, putting the fans, communities and pet owners in the driver’s seat, and it is linking right through the chain to digital commerce. This is about a new growth equation and how we are thinking about building the business. Earned is playing a key role at the table.

This has been a long process. I have to pay great tribute to our lead CMO, Gülen Bengi, who came to a point of view midway through last year that the marketing world had changed so much that to build a relevant reach and truly connect and engage with our consumers, we need to do things very differently.

Talk me through how the new agency structure will change PR strategy for Mars Snacking and Petcare?

It means for our big consumer brands and for those two businesses, there will be a very integrated approach to how we hog the conversation, reach consumers and how we have two-way conversations with consumers. It’s really about how you ensure there is a cultural fluency It’s taking the idea of the press office or newsroom mindset into how we build our brands in a super-integrated way.

Mars confirmed Edelman will no longer handle brand PR. Are you ending relationships with any other PR firms?

All brand PR, as of January, will move under this arena. There will be a host of local relationships in support of brands that will no longer continue. We have never before had one agency that covered brand PR for a Mars business unit globally or one agency that would cover PR for one brand globally. So this is moving away from having a large number of tactical relationships into something that is much more strategic with an earned-first mindset at the outset.

Will there be any changes to Mars’ in-house comms team?

We will have to evolve to make sure we are making this work in the best possible way. [With] the amount of digital fluency and data fluency we want to build into our approaches, it will inevitably be that we build skills and capabilities in our agency partners and within Mars. Just as we think about the transformation we are expecting from our partners, we need to be on that transformation journey ourselves. We have a very comprehensive capability-development program internally, so we are looking to integrate this into it and ensure also that in each of the key businesses, it has the right senior stewardship and leadership. It means I am going to spend more of my time thinking about these topics than I would have previously. Similarly, our VPs of corporate affairs in the specific businesses at a global level and regionally will spend more time thinking about these topics.

Aside from The Weber Shandwick Collective, what other PR firms within IPG will Mars work with?

It was a comprehensive process. Weber Shandwick has been a long-term partner. They did the most brand PR work for us within the U.S. and wider North America. We are trying to do this globally with a single agency partner. We will work with The Weber Shandwick Collective collaboratively. It is always the case that not one single agency has the best capabilities in every market at all times, so we are working with all our partners to ensure we make full use of the broader capabilities within those agency groups.

We are starting with The Weber Shandwick Collective, and that is who works with us and who pitched, but as this develops and as we find what is the best in every market in support of our core brands, we are open to a broader approach across IPG. It’s foolish to rule out any approach to realize the dream we are after.

Omnicom is in the process of acquiring Interpublic Group. Any comment on how this will affect Mars’ agency relationships?

I can't comment on the merger. Omnicom is our retained creative agency. If the acquisition goes ahead, IPG will become part of Omnicom. If you look at our partners, any PR agency worth their salt has a record of successfully working with other agencies in the marketing mix that can sometimes be part of the same holding company or other holding companies. So we don't think it will meaningfully change things. No one has a monopoly on creativity. Creativity cannot be coded. In this earned-first world, it’s the idea that connects and has virality, so that is how we are expecting all our agency partners to work.

Why did you pick The Weber Shandwick Collective?

They are a strong partner for us. They have done some great work. They stood out for their ability to match the scale of our ambition. They also have a mindset that aligns with our brand-building philosophy: global in vision, local in voice and culturally fluent by design. And they have been a partner for over 20 years.

With focus on rising sports media and marketing efforts, NHL team sponsorship revenue climbed 9% year-over-year to $1.5 billion for the 2024-25 season, according to SponsorUnited.

The average sponsorship deal is now at $529,000. Overall sponsorship revenue for the league is up 20% since the 2022-23 TV season.

It notes 500 new brands have made deals with the league year-over-year -- with finance (up 8%), business services (18%), and automotive brands (8%) accounting for one-third of the new sponsorship money.

Leading individual NHL high profile star players -- Connor McDavid (of the Edmonton Oilers) and Matthew Tkachuk (of the Florida Panthers) the faces of each participating Stanley Cup team – lead the league with eight brand deals each.

Focusing on growing uniform ‘patch” brand signage, SponsorUnited says the average NHL jersey patch deals range from $3.4 million to $4.2 million, which is nearly a third less than the average across the other leagues, which is approximately $6 million.

Biggest sponsorship spenders for the NHL: Crypto.com, AB InBev; Toyota Motor; Scotiabank; and Roger Communications.

The average sponsorship deal volume per team is now 92 -- up 7% from 89 in the previous season. The top five teams in terms of deals are the Nashville Predators, with 141; the Washington Capitals, with 139; the Vegas Golden Knights, with 136, and the Edmonton Oilers, with 119.

This relaunch coincides with Delta’s 100th anniversary and positions the airline to better serve Korean passengers while expanding its reach across the U.S. via its Salt Lake City hub.

Delta Restarts Salt Lake City to Seoul Flight

The newly launched Salt Lake City–Seoul route reflects Delta’s broader strategic efforts to reinforce its trans-Pacific network.

Operated in partnership with Korean Air (KE), this new service gives Korean travelers access to 35 U.S. cities through SLC, with efficient international-to-domestic connections averaging just 55 minutes, comparable to transfer times at Incheon.

Jeff Moomaw, Delta’s Vice President of Asia Pacific, highlighted the significance of the launch at a press event in Seoul. “This year marks Delta’s 100th anniversary. Introducing a new route to Korea during this milestone makes the occasion even more special,” he said.

Delta and Korean Air have operated a joint venture since 2018, and this collaboration now connects Seoul to 14 destinations across the United States. As a result, Delta has become the largest long-haul foreign carrier at Incheon International Airport (ICN).

Delta emphasized its commitment to deepening ties with Korean Air, describing the alliance as the leading trans-Pacific joint venture. Joint efforts include co-developed digital platforms and streamlined booking systems, allowing passengers to use either airline’s mobile app for reservations and check-in across both networks.

Moomaw explained, “Together, we’ve made joint investments in digital solutions and customer experience improvements to deliver top-tier service.” The integrated experience aims to provide travelers with a seamless journey, from booking to arrival.

Addressing Market Dynamics

Regarding recent investor activity involving Hanjin KAL—the parent of Korean Air—Delta downplayed speculation about management instability.

Hoban Construction recently acquired an 18.46% stake in Hanjin KAL, prompting speculation of a control dispute. However, Delta views the investment as non-disruptive.

“I have good trust in Walter Cho (Korean Air Chairman),” Moomaw stated. “We view Hoban’s stake increase as a simple investment.” In response to the move, Hanjin transferred treasury shares to its employee welfare fund, increasing Cho’s stake to 20.79% and maintaining a lead over Hoban.

Delta itself holds a 14.9% stake in Hanjin KAL, underscoring its vested interest in the long-term stability of Korean Air.

Delta also reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, viewing it as an opportunity to align flights with market demand and improve service quality.

“We are very excited about the acquisition,” Moomaw said. “Our priority remains aligning the right flights with the right markets to provide the best possible service to our passengers.”

New Summer 2025 Routes to Europe

Delta Air Lines launched its most extensive transatlantic summer schedule to date, introducing new direct flights from major U.S. hubs including New York (JFK), Atlanta (ATL), Boston (BOS), Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW).

With expanded service to Europe, Delta becomes the largest U.S. carrier to destinations such as Italy, France, Greece, and Denmark, and the only U.S. airline flying nonstop to Prague (PRG) this season.

Delta Air Lines (DL) is not only adding capacity but also infusing its network expansion with vibrant, culture-rich celebrations.

The airline has ramped up operations to key European cities, reinforcing its leadership in transatlantic travel and spotlighting Italy as a central focus. Service to Italy has increased by over 10% year-over-year, solidifying Delta as the top U.S. carrier in the Italian market.

Each new route launch was marked by festive events at departure gates, highlighting the cultural identity of the destination.

Boston (BOS) to Barcelona (BCN): Logan Airport’s Terminal E hosted flamenco dancers and Spanish guitarists, bringing the vibrant streets of Barcelona to life. Travelers were welcomed with mocktails and a Spanish-themed send-off.

Boston (BOS) to Milan (MXP): The Milan-bound flight was celebrated with live opera performances and elegant Italian refreshments, offering a taste of Italy’s fashion capital before departure.

New York (JFK) to Catania (CTA): Delta’s first-ever direct route to Catania, Sicily, took off with a celebration featuring Sicilian desserts, a cannoli-inspired cake, and live regional music, channeling the spirit of Mount Etna and the Mediterranean coast.

Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) to Copenhagen (CPH): A ribbon-cutting ceremony with Delta executives and local officials marked this inaugural flight, accompanied by Scandinavian music and speeches recognizing the growing U.S.-Nordic connection.

Additional Routes Across Europe

Delta’s summer schedule includes several other key route launches that expand access across Europe:

Detroit (DTW) to Dublin, Ireland (DUB) – Connecting the Midwest to Ireland with direct service.

Atlanta (ATL) to Naples, Italy (NAP) – Enhancing access to Italy’s southern coast.

Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) to Rome, Italy (FCO) – Adding another gateway to the Italian capital.

Atlanta (ATL) to Brussels, Belgium (BRU) – Service launched June 10, linking Georgia with Belgium’s capital.

Delta’s move solidifies its role as a major player in U.S.-Europe air travel for summer 2025. With culturally rich celebrations and robust route offerings, the airline gives passengers enhanced opportunities to experience Europe directly from the U.S.

Delta’s Strategic Focus on European Growth

This network growth is part of Delta’s long-term strategy to capture demand for transatlantic travel, especially during peak summer months.

By leveraging its U.S. hubs and aligning route launches with local festivities, Delta strengthens its brand presence and customer loyalty across major European markets.

Italy, in particular, continues to be a priority, with Delta leading as the primary U.S. airline flying to multiple Italian cities. Enhanced connectivity, experiential send-offs, and diversified European access position Delta to compete aggressively with other global carriers on transatlantic routes.

The coffeehouse experience defines the Starbucks brand, and these leaders and their teams bring that experience to life for millions of customers every day.” Starbucks: A new era of leadership and customer experience LE25 is an important milestone for Starbucks.
In a recent internal survey, 84% of U.S. store partners—over 160,000 baristas and coffeehouse leaders—shared their feedback, marking the highest participation rate to date.
“We believe a great partner experience fuels the customer experience,” said Grams.
LE25 will also spotlight the first-ever Starbucks Global Barista Championship— a celebration of Starbucks baristas who embody the company’s commitment to community, connection and craft.","LAS VEGAS, USA – This week, Starbucks is hosting over 14,000 coffeehouse leaders from across North America at Leadership Experience 2025 (LE25) in Las Vegas—its largest leadership gathering ever and the first under chairman and ceo Brian Niccol and coo Mike Grams.

“Getting ‘Back to Starbucks’ means refocusing on what has always set us apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas,” said Niccol. “We are bringing together our coffeehouse leaders from across North America to celebrate, empower and equip them to accelerate our transformation. The coffeehouse experience defines the Starbucks brand, and these leaders and their teams bring that experience to life for millions of customers every day.”

Starbucks: A new era of leadership and customer experience

LE25 is an important milestone for Starbucks. Over three days, coffeehouse leaders will engage in immersive workshops, connect over new ways of working, hear directly from company leaders, and experience the first-ever Starbucks Global Barista Championship, celebrating craft, connection, excellence at its best.

The event will accelerate Starbucks turnaround—centered on exceptional service, simplified routines, and deeper customer connections. Leaders will explore new innovations, clearer customer service standards, and a renewed focus on hospitality, including a goal of four-minute wait times – without compromising the warmth and connection that define the Starbucks Experience.

“This isn’t just a reset—it’s a recommitment to who we are when we are at our best,” said Grams. “LE25 is our moment to recommit to a culture of hospitality and excellence. We’re making progress, have real momentum with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan and are on the right track to turn the business around.”

Since launching its Back to Starbucks strategy nine months ago, customers are already feeling the difference, with welcoming spaces, more confident baristas, faster service, and the return of small but meaningful touches like ceramic mugs, handwritten notes on cups, a more consistent dress code, and a much-loved customer favorite: the condiment bar.

“Our turnaround is rooted in listening—to partners and customers—and taking action on what we hear,” added Grams. “We’re listening and testing in the coffeehouse, and then applying our learnings to scale quickly and enhance the customer and partner experience.”

Leading with partners, Winning with customers

Starbucks continues to lead the industry in partner (employee) care, offering industry-leading pay and benefits that average more than $30 per hour for baristas. Benefits for eligible partners include 100% tuition coverage for a first-time bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University, up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave, equity in the form of stock, and more. As part of its focus on making Starbucks the best job in retail, the company now also has a goal to hire 90% of retail leaders from within, fostering a culture of growth and opportunity.

Since launching Back to Starbucks, Starbucks has seen strong early results: shift completion rates are at record highs, turnover is at a record low—less than half the industry average—and partner engagement scores continue to rise. In a recent internal survey, 84% of U.S. store partners—over 160,000 baristas and coffeehouse leaders—shared their feedback, marking the highest participation rate to date. The results show a strong upward trend in partner engagement, with strong and growing majorities of both coffeehouse leaders and baristas recommending Starbucks as a great place to work.

“We believe a great partner experience fuels the customer experience,” said Grams. “We always have more work to do, but our partners are rallying behind Back to Starbucks and telling us they like what they see. When our partners feel supported, our customers notice the difference too.”

Coffee and craft take center stage

LE25 kicks off today with Starbucks largest-ever coffee tasting, featuring a first taste of the new Starbucks 1971 Roast™, available in the U.S. and Canada this Winter. The company is also celebrating the impact of its investment in the Global Farmer Fund, supporting long-term sustainability across Origin communities.

LE25 will also spotlight the first-ever Starbucks Global Barista Championship— a celebration of Starbucks baristas who embody the company’s commitment to community, connection and craft. Over the three-day competition, 12 baristas from around the world will showcase their coffee passion and expertise through a variety of skills and knowledge-based competitions.

“We’re returning to what made us iconic: handcrafted coffee, human connection, and a relentless focus on excellence,” said Niccol. “We’re reigniting the soul of Starbucks, together.”

Giving back in Las Vegas

This week, Starbucks is demonstrating how major events can be designed with sustainability and community in mind. LE25 is powered by 100% renewable electricity sourced within 500 miles of Las Vegas. Starbucks will donate any surplus food to its FoodShare partner Three Square Food Bank, divert food waste and coffee grounds from the event to local farms, and plant 10 trees per attendee to support reforestation efforts in South American coffee-growing communities.

The Starbucks Foundation will invite attendees to vote for five local Las Vegas organizations to receive grants, with an estimated $100,000 to be donated to causes like hunger relief, homelessness, youth empowerment and more. The Starbucks Foundation is also donating a $10,000 Neighborhood Grant to each Barista Championship contestant’s chosen nonprofit.",https://www.comunicaffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Logo-Starbucks-e1656573908529.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 01:08:50.694800

Needless to say, it's pretty clear that Ralph Lauren has no interest in courting price-conscious customers.
Instead, it seems to be moving even more into a high-end market as it looks to become an even more exclusive brand.","Ralph Lauren has long been one of the biggest and most influential names in men's fashion, and it sounds like they are looking to lean on that notoriety as they look to raise prices and continue to court less price-sensitive customers.

Last month, Ralph Lauren announced during a call with analysts that it planned to raise its prices in the coming months into next year.

While the move is in line with moves from other similar clothing brands responding to the tariffs that were recently imposed by the Donald Trump administration, it does not sound like that is the sole reason for Ralph Lauren's price increases.

As it turns out, the company was already planning to increase its prices even before the tariffs were announced as it moves forward with what appears to be a new brand identity.

During a recent call with analysts, Ralph Lauren Chief Financial Officer Justin Picicci explained that the brand was shifting its focus toward younger and more high-end customers who are less sensitive to price increases.

“We’ve been on this multi-year journey to shift our customer base towards less price-sensitive consumers, especially in the full-price channel,” Picicci said on a call with analysts according to the Wall Street Journal.

While this might not be good news for some consumers, it sounds like the brand has already had success with the strategy, reporting larger profits and a jump in revenue for the first three months of the year as a result of those higher prices and lower cotton costs.

With this success, Ralph Lauren is already planning to increase prices even more in the upcoming fall as well as next year's spring.

Needless to say, it's pretty clear that Ralph Lauren has no interest in courting price-conscious customers.

According to the UFCW Local 324 and 770 Bargaining Committee, negotiations have been going on for months without successful progress.
Zinder said negotiations have become increasingly strained and difficult, and she said the vote is meant to protest against unfair labor practices.
Albertsons’ Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the Southern California division, Courtney Carranza, provided a statement to Voice of OC regarding the contract negotiations.
If the companies are not willing to make progress towards reaching an agreement with the union’s demands, the employees are prepared to strike, she said.","Yesterday, 45,000 Southern California grocery workers voted to authorize a strike against Albertsons, Vons and Ralphs after months of what union officials say are unfair labor practices during contract negotiations.

President of UFCW Local 324 Andrea Zinder said both companies — Albertsons, which owns and operates Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions, and Kroger, which owns and operates Ralphs — have used intimidation tactics, surveillance methods and threats to managers to interfere with negotiations.

According to the UFCW Local 324 and 770 Bargaining Committee, negotiations have been going on for months without successful progress.

“For four months, we’ve negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions, and customer service,” reads a Wednesday statement from union representatives. “The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal’, downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily.”

The strike authorization vote means grocery workers are prepared to walk out if deemed necessary as they negotiate for increased wages, healthcare benefits and increased staffing.

Zinder said negotiations have become increasingly strained and difficult, and she said the vote is meant to protest against unfair labor practices.

“Negotiations are at a difficult point right now,” Zinder said in a phone interview on June 12.

Albertsons’ Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the Southern California division, Courtney Carranza, provided a statement to Voice of OC regarding the contract negotiations.

“We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers, and allows our company to remain competitive,” she wrote in a Thursday email.

A Ralphs spokesperson also responded to the claims.

“We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the Union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption,” the spokesperson wrote in a Thursday email.

“Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer. We remain committed to good faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.”

Zinder said employee wages have fallen behind the cost of living, even after a recent significant pay increase that was a result of 2022 contract negotiations.

“We want fair wages,” she said in a phone interview. “Our members are feeling the same effects of inflation as everyone in the community, but it is really hitting our members hard.”

She said staffing is another issue that grocery store employees want to see addressed in these contract negotiations.

“Stores are very understaffed,” Zinder said.

According to Zinder, when stores are understaffed, they increasingly rely on self-checkout, shelves may go unstocked and delis sometimes close early.

“This not only affects the customers, but it also affects the employees in the store,” Zinder said. “They are doing twice as much work, and the customers are often unhappy and lashing out at employees because they are so frustrated.”

Zinder also emphasized that understaffed stores result in safety issues and work environment issues.

There are three more dates of negotiations at the end of June, with the first one scheduled for June 25, according to Zinder.

The local grocery union president said she hopes these two companies come back to the table and give employees on the bargaining committee an opportunity to tell their stories and listen to the concerns and needs of employees regarding staffing and wage increases.

“We are hoping they will come back to the bargaining table, realizing they are making a lot of money,” she said. “Both of these companies are making a lot of money, giving millions out on Wall Street to shareholders.”

Zinder added that it was time these large corporations invested back into their stores.

“They need to invest in the stores,” she said. “Investing in the store not only means putting in more money to remodel, but it also means paying employees what they deserve and having enough employees.”

Zinder said a rally will take place on June 20 in Long Beach to raise awareness and give a platform to workers’ demands.

If the companies are not willing to make progress towards reaching an agreement with the union’s demands, the employees are prepared to strike, she said.

“If we are not able to make progress, we may need to go on strike over these unfair labor practices that companies have committed,” Zinder said.

Zinder said that only select stores would face strikes, but that all employees are getting ready if it becomes necessary.

“We are hoping that companies will understand that we are serious and they need to do the right thing or they will face strikes outside their stores.”",https://voiceofoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4113.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:15:17.098991

“My direct focus is on clinician engagement, particularly physicians and nurses, and their well-being,” Dr. Goodrich said.

“Clinicians sometimes feel like they’re not being seen or heard,” Dr. Goodrich said.
Humana recently piloted ambient AI technology to reduce documentation burden, which records a physician-patient visit and generates a note.","Humana is taking proactive steps to address burnout and improve engagement for its thousands of employed or affiliated clinicians by focusing on well-being, reducing turnover, and tackling frustrations related to technology and administrative processes, according to the company’s Chief Medical Officer, Kate Goodrich, MD.

Dr. Goodrich discussed the company’s recent ambient AI pilot on the Becker’s Healthcare podcast, an episode that will air later this month.

“My direct focus is on clinician engagement, particularly physicians and nurses, and their well-being,” Dr. Goodrich said. “I’m also increasingly focused on improving our working relationship with clinicians that we contract with. We want to find ways to address friction points and administrative frustrations between providers and payers. There’s a lot of potential there, and a strong desire to improve that area.”

Five notes:

1. Humana has around 1,200 physicians across its insurance and care delivery divisions, as well as about 7,000 nurses. The company is focused on reducing clinician turnover and allowing them to practice at the top of their license.

2. One area the company is targeting regarding clinician burnout is frustration around daily technology use, including the use of EHRs.

“Clinicians sometimes feel like they’re not being seen or heard,” Dr. Goodrich said. “They believe they could contribute more, but they aren’t always invited to the right conversations. Additionally, they want opportunities for growth and development.”

3. Humana recently piloted ambient AI technology to reduce documentation burden, which records a physician-patient visit and generates a note.

4. Surveyed clinicians say the ambient tool is reducing documentation time and cognitive load, or the mental fatigue caused by managing too much complexity during patient visits.

5. Humana is also developing AI tools that could summarize a patient’s medical history and interactions, such as hospital visits or prescriptions. This would save time spent searching through multiple portals and improve accuracy by providing a concise summary before the clinician meets the patient.",https://www.beckerspayer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/payer-og-image.png,N,,2025-06-12 22:25:52.502498

One of the big box store’s biggest competitors, the Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, has offered a similar feature known as Scan & Go for a while.
As Fortune reports, Sam’s Club developed the tech in 2013, but customers could initially only pay for their items via self-checkout registers.","Costco, the wholesale warehouse chain with a cult following, encourages its customers to bulk-shop to their heart’s content. But each consumer’s impulse to heap their cart with deals can lead to lines with long waits at the register. The membership-focused franchise aims to address the issue with its newest feature, Scan & Pay.

As its name suggests, the technology—a collaboration with Instacart—allows shoppers to scan the items they want, add them to their digital shopping carts, and pay for everything via the company app. Customers must then scan a QR code at a kiosk before exiting the store.

During the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris described some early Scan & Pay test results as “very positive” for members and “successful” at speeding up lines.

One of the big box store’s biggest competitors, the Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, has offered a similar feature known as Scan & Go for a while. As Fortune reports, Sam’s Club developed the tech in 2013, but customers could initially only pay for their items via self-checkout registers. The retailer eventually allowed shoppers to checkout and pay through its designated app. Now, Sam’s Club wants to get rid of self-checkout lines all together in favor of Scan & Go—it even replaced manual receipt checks with AI and “computer vision tech” in January 2024.

This isn’t Instacart’s first foray into the world of high-tech grocery shopping, either. The grocery delivery service recently started using artificial intelligence features to improve its inventory prediction technology and provide more accurate updates to customers.","https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_450,w_5616,h_3159/c_fill,w_1440,ar_1440:810,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/mentalfloss/01jxjr90vspmpze0vgbr.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:27:25.779169

Why it matters: ""We had this strategy that I think was just a misfire of a purpose-driven store. It's like, well, the purpose is community connection,"" Niccol said. ""I think that's what got us off our game.""

""We've got to get the seats back,"" he said in an interview at the company's Leadership Experience event in Las Vegas.

The big picture: Under Niccol — who joined from Chipotle in September — Starbucks has been making a series of changes to reverse a decline in foot traffic and sales as part of what it calls the ""Back to Starbucks"" plan.

After years of prioritizing digital orders and drive-thrus, Starbucks is looking to create community spaces with more seating, bringing back ceramic mugs and adding new menu items, Niccol said.

He tells Axios that the company has been making progress, but it might take time before the results show up in earnings.

""I hope sooner rather than later,"" he said.

Zoom in: Niccol called Starbucks' iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte a ""fastball"" and said the company has to create new ""fastballs for the business.""

Some of the products being tested like a ""chocolate protein cold foam,"" banana bread lattes and food that's baked in stores, he said.

""It's significantly better and it also just looks delicious,"" he said of two croissants and a double chocolate cookie being tested. We got to innovate on those things.""

What's next: Starbucks is rolling out a ""Green Apron Service Model"" to stores by the end of the summer, Niccol said, which it hopes will speed up the time it takes to make drinks. The company's goal: a 4-minute wait time for drinks.

The company announced this week it will add full-time assistant managers across the U.S. to help busy stores run more smoothly.

""We're going to have innovation to our app, our rewards program, and that will happen over the next six to nine months,"" Niccol told Axios.

The intrigue: Niccol's turnaround plan has the support of former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who said Wednesday that he ""did a cartwheel in my living room"" the first time he heard about the strategy.

""It was so brilliant. It's short, to the point and it's exactly to the tip of the spear who we should be and who we are,"" Schultz said from the stage. ""And we are, above all else, a coffee company.""

Reporting directly to CEO Sam Altman, the move to the ChatGPT-maker represents the latest chapter in a career that has taken Simo from a fishing family in France's Mediterranean port of Sete to the heights of Silicon Valley.

As the current CEO of grocery delivery platform Instacart, she cuts a unique profile: a French woman in the male-dominated American tech landscape—who resists advice to blend in.

""I can put all my energy trying to be someone else or I can be myself and pour all of that energy into what I can create,"" she told CNBC in February.

This philosophy will likely be on display when she appears Thursday at the VivaTech conference in Paris.

Raised in Sete, Simo attended the elite HEC business school before joining eBay in 2006, first in France then in California.

""People expect a very business-like story for why I decided to come to the US. It wasn't. The American Dream was on TV every night and that was an incredibly appealing thing,"" she said.

'Never Intimidated'

In 2011, Simo joined Facebook, now Meta. She was given responsibility for video and monetization in 2014, a role she considers the defining moment of her career.

Simo championed the company's pivot to video, which became central to Meta's strategy despite initial internal skepticism.

""She never let herself be intimidated,"" recalled David Marcus, who worked at Meta alongside Simo and now serves as CEO of online payment company Lightspark.

""She had an ability to challenge Mark (Zuckerberg) and push him, when others would have hesitated.""

Joining Instacart in 2021, Simo inherited a company that had been bleeding money for a decade.

Under her leadership, the grocery delivery platform achieved profitability in 2022 through aggressive diversification: data monetization, expanded retail partnerships and a robust advertising business.

Now Simo faces her biggest test yet. As OpenAI's number two, she'll free up CEO Altman to focus on research and infrastructure while she tackles the company's operational challenges.

Despite being one of history's most highly funded startups and ChatGPT's phenomenal success, OpenAI is burning cash at an alarming rate.

The company has also weathered significant leadership turnover, including Altman's own brief ouster and reinstatement in 2023, raising questions about management stability.

But French investor Julien Codorniou, who worked alongside Simo at Facebook, said she will more than rise to the occasion.

""Fidji's arrival is a declaration of ambition by OpenAI,"" he said.

Kroger and Albertsons are the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons, and Pavilions grocery stores.

The UFCW Locals 324 and 770 Bargaining Committee said the following:

“The results are in, and we have overwhelmingly voted to authorize an Unfair Labor Practice strike at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions throughout Southern California. Our message is clear: we are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve.

“For four months, we’ve negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions, and customer service. The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal’, downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily.

“At the same time, the companies have broken labor laws by engaging in unlawful surveillance, interrogation of members at actions, threats, and retaliation for union activity. This is unacceptable.

“We’re at the breaking point. We are disrespected, overworked, and undervalued by Kroger and Albertsons. We’re tired of asking these corporations to invest in their workers and customers, only to see no results. We’re tired of asking the companies to respect our labor rights and seeing our co-workers intimidated.

“This strike authorization vote means that we expect the companies to return to the bargaining table, negotiate a deal that works for everyone, and desist from their unlawful tactics, before we walk out and hit the picket lines.”

Grocery shoppers are also feeling frustrated by major grocery chains like Kroger and Albertsons, and recent reports show why. Consumer Reports caught Kroger overcharging customers by 18.4%, while the Economic Roundtable’s “Bullies at the Table” study shows 92% of workers have witnessed this practice. A customer survey conducted by UFCW Locals 770 and 324, along with LAANE, reveals most shoppers report severe understaffing at Kroger and Albertsons stores, resulting in empty shelves, unbearable checkout lines, and shifted burden to shoppers.

Forty-five thousand UFCW members across Southern California who work at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions took unfair labor practice strike authorization votes the first two weeks of June. Negotiations are scheduled to continue on June 25, 26 and 27.

Tens of thousands of additional union grocery workers across the country who are employed by Kroger and Albertsons –the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons, and Pavilions– also voted to authorize a strike last week, bringing over 100,000 grocery workers to the brink of a strike at the same time. Should the workers call a strike, it could create the largest grocery strike in modern history, and a major labor disruption for two of the nation’s largest grocery chains this summer, their busiest season of the year.

Grocery Workers Rising are employed at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, Stater Bros., Gelson’s and Super A stores. Their contracts expired on March 2, 2025.

These 65,000 grocery workers make up the largest union grocery contracts in the nation, are rising up and fighting for:

Living wages

Affordable healthcare benefits

A reliable pension

More staffing and better working conditions for a better customer experience

For decades, betting against McDonald’s has proven to be a losing strategy. The company has weathered every headwind imaginable: Calls for healthier eating, tougher labour laws, the rise and fall of plant-based meat, and complex procurement challenges. Through it all, McDonald’s has remained remarkably resilient.

Article content

This week, McDonald’s shares dipped following an analyst downgrade, triggered by concerns over the growing use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. Analysts estimate the company could lose up to 28 million customer visits in the U.S. alone. While the market reaction has been modest so far, the long-term implications are serious. By 2030, up to 30 million Americans — nearly 1 in 10 — may be using GLP-1 medications. In Canada, that number could reach between 1.5 and 3 million, equivalent to the entire population of the Island of Montreal.

These medications suppress appetite and, by extension, shift consumption patterns. Early data suggests that consumers on GLP-1s are eating less frequently and with greater intentionality. This poses a direct threat to brands built on impulse consumption — particularly those targeting value-conscious or lower-income demographics, a category into which McDonald’s firmly falls.

The food industry has faced disruption before. The rise of online grocery and food delivery services in the early 2000s challenged the sector’s reliance on impulse-based purchasing. Digital platforms forced companies to reimagine how they connect with consumers in a non-physical environment. The growing adoption of GLP-1s presents a similar disruption — but this time, the driver is physiological, not technological, and largely outside the industry’s control.

The downgrade of McDonald’s stock should not be dismissed lightly. In Canada, the company operates more than 1,400 restaurants, employs approximately 90,000 people, and commands 18% to 20% of the quick-service market. It serves more than 2.5 million Canadians every day. McDonald’s is also the largest single buyer of Canadian beef and eggs in the foodservice industry — making it a crucial link in the domestic agri-food value chain.

Other signals point to broader structural shifts. WeightWatchers has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Major snacking companies are also feeling the pressure. Year-over-year, PepsiCo’s stock is down nearly 21%, Nestlé is down 10%, and Mars has seen a 5% decline. Nestlé has even introduced a line of “Ozempic-friendly” products to cater to a new consumer reality: Smaller appetites, higher sensitivity to side effects, and less frequent indulgence.

As was the case with the rise of plant-based diets, the food industry is once again being forced to adapt. The difference this time is that GLP-1 usage isn’t a lifestyle choice — it’s a medical intervention. Quick-service chains now recognize that if one member of a group can’t find a suitable menu option, the entire group may choose to dine elsewhere.

This is, quite simply, a turning point. It marks the first time in modern history that a pharmaceutical innovation is reshaping the global food landscape at scale. McDonald’s has proven its adaptability in the past and may do so again. But make no mistake: The GLP-1 revolution has the full attention of many executives in the food industry — and with good reason.

North American factories remain underutilized, with persistent weakness in Mexico and Canada

Europe inches toward industrial recovery, while U.K. downturn deepens

CLARK, N.J., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index — a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses — fell to -0.46 in May, from -0.39 in April, signaling increasing spare capacity across the world's supply chains as a result of tariffs and tit-for-tat trade war.

Global supply chain activity was driven lower by a deterioration across Asia, which reported the greatest degree of spare capacity in almost a year and a half. The quantity of raw materials and components purchased by Asian factories weakened for the second consecutive month in May, signaling stronger retrenchment. Notably, China was central to this regionwide decline during May.

North America's supply chains remain underutilized due to considerable weakness in Mexico and Canada. In the U.S., manufacturers continue to be underutilized, but they increased purchases of raw materials and commodities, bolstering inventories to protect against future higher prices or supply disruptions.

The European industrial sector edged closer to recovery, with activity at the region's suppliers broadly level with April, which was the strongest for 10 months. Manufacturers on the continent have been buoyed by recently announced fiscal stimulus measures, particularly in Germany. The U.K.'s supply chains remain severely underutilized, with the country's manufacturers retrenching aggressively again in May.

""U.S.-China trade talks come at a critical moment — Chinese factory demand has dropped sharply, and U.S. manufacturing is weighed down by excess capacity,"" said John Piatek, VP consulting, GEP. ""This isn't just macro noise. Tariffs are already reshaping procurement strategies as companies front-load inventories, diversify suppliers, and brace for a longer game of economic decoupling.""

Interpreting the data:Index > 0, supply chain capacity is being stretched. The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are.Index < 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.

Interpreting the data:Index > 0, supply chain capacity is being stretched. The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are.Index < 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.

MAY 2025 REGIONAL KEY FINDINGS

ASIA: Index fell to -0.40, from -0.32, signaling that the region's supply chains were the most underutilized since December 2023. Chinese factories pulled back their purchasing in May.

NORTH AMERICA: Index rose to -0.24, from -0.34, reflecting some pickup in purchasing volumes in the U.S., driving supply chain activity higher. Weak conditions in Mexico and Canada continue to weigh on manufacturing in the region.

EUROPE: Index little changed since April (-0.29), down fractionally to -0.30. Albeit still indicating underutilized supplier capacity, the index is much higher than on average over the past two years as Europe's industrial recovery progresses.

U.K.: Index rose to -0.97, from -1.12, but still at a level indicative of considerable slack across supply chains, showing marked weakness across the U.K. manufacturing industry.

MAY 2025 KEY FINDINGS

DEMAND: Global demand for raw materials, commodities and components remained subdued, with no improvement seen since April and therefore meaning it remains at its weakest in the year-to-date. Procurement activity in Asia was down at its sharpest in nearly a year and a half, driven by retrenchment among Chinese factories.

INVENTORIES: Global safety stockpiling reports remain historically low, primarily due to inventory strategies in Europe, with manufacturers across the continent continuing to favor lean warehouses. This contrasts with the trend in North America, with safety stockpiling above its long-term average for a second successive month.

MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Our global item shortages indicator, which tracks the availability of critical commodities, common inputs and components, remains below its long-term average, signaling robust global material supply levels. This metric implies that vendors have stock to meet orders from their customers.

LABOR SHORTAGES: Reports of backlogged work rising due to staff shortages ticked up slightly at the global level in May but overall, they remain close to historically typical levels, indicating that suppliers' workforce capacity remains sufficient to cope with current demand.

TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs were broadly in line with their long-term average in May.

It is derived from S&P Global's PMI® surveys, sent to companies in over 40 countries, totaling around 27,000 companies. The headline figure is a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price & Supply Indicators compiled by S&P Global.

A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.

A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.

A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the U.K. For more information about the methodology, click here.

It seeks to meet the demands of B2B and hybrid ecommerce buyers who increasingly expect consumer-grade delivery speed and flexibility.
Essendant and Roadie partnership The partnership allows Essendant to integrate Roadie directly into its existing fulfillment network, which includes 30 distribution centers across the U.S.
It also says it supports ecommerce fulfillment to 98% of the U.S. population with next-day service.
It covers technology and business trends in the growing B2B ecommerce industry.","Essendant has partnered with Roadie to boost its local delivery capabilities and support the rapid growth of its ecommerce operations.

Essendant is a distributor of business supplies. The United Parcel Service (UPS) owns Roadie, a crowdsourced delivery platform. The agreement gives Essendant access to Roadie’s network of more than 200,000 independent drivers. That enables the distributor to offer same-day and next-day delivery in metropolitan markets and hard-to-reach locations without expanding its own fleet. The move is part of a broader push to modernize Essendant’s logistics infrastructure. It seeks to meet the demands of B2B and hybrid ecommerce buyers who increasingly expect consumer-grade delivery speed and flexibility.

Essendant and Roadie partnership

The partnership allows Essendant to integrate Roadie directly into its existing fulfillment network, which includes 30 distribution centers across the U.S. This integration will allow ecommerce orders to be routed dynamically based on proximity, carrier availability, and delivery times — key requirements in a B2B market that is rapidly adopting digital-first procurement practices.

“As ecommerce continues to reshape how businesses source and receive supplies, delivery speed has become a competitive differentiator,” said Tim Engstrom, senior vice president of supply chain at Essendant. “Our partnership with Roadie helps us close the last-mile gap without investing in dedicated assets, allowing us to move faster and smarter.”

Essendant’s logistics overhaul is part of a larger digital transformation strategy under new CEO Dave Rickard. He took the helm earlier this year following the departure of interim CEO David Boone. Rickard previously served as the company’s interim chief transformation officer. He brings experience from Uline, US Foods, and Boston Consulting Group.

Rickard now leads the company’s connected commerce initiative multi-pronged effort to:

Grow ecommerce sales

Integrate with online marketplaces

Offer seamless fulfillment options for both resellers and end-users.

Essendant says it currently partners with over 1,300 brands and 560 suppliers. It also says it supports ecommerce fulfillment to 98% of the U.S. population with next-day service.

The Roadie integration builds on this foundation by enabling Essendant to better serve B2B, B2C, and B2B2C channels through more responsive and scalable delivery solutions.

With more than $5 billion in annual net sales, Essendant is competing in a digital commerce environment where speed, transparency, and service reliability increasingly determine market share. The company says strategic partnerships like this one are key to meeting the expectations of modern ecommerce buyers while maintaining operational efficiency.

“Many cardiovascular device companies rely on manufacturing outside the U.S. to address demand, especially from the U.S.,” David Beauchamp, a medical analyst with GlobalData, said in a company statement.
Thus far, device companies have remained confident they can push forward in the face of tariffs.
For now, Beauchamp noted, these companies should prepare for “decreased revenues and growth” in the United States.
On June 10, the World Bank Group officially predicted that the U.S. economy will grow half as fast in 2025 as it did in 2024.","The Trump administration’s ongoing trade war with China could do significant long-term damage in the United States, creating new challenges for the country’s booming cardiovascular device market. That is all according to GlobalData, a leading data analytics firm.

“Many cardiovascular device companies rely on manufacturing outside the U.S. to address demand, especially from the U.S.,” David Beauchamp, a medical analyst with GlobalData, said in a company statement. “Tariffs are likely to cause increases in material cost and disrupt long-standing supply chains. Currently, the U.S. does not have the manufacturing capacity to adjust to possible losses that could result from the impacts of tariffs.”

Medical device manufacturers such as Medtronic, Edwards Lifesciences, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, Abbott and Boston Scientific have focused more and more on the cardiovascular market in recent years. The U.S. population is getting older—and in many cases, sicker—causing the demand for these devices to rise.

Thus far, device companies have remained confident they can push forward in the face of tariffs. Medtronic, for example, estimated that tariffs could cost the company up to $350 million, but its leaders do not seem too phased by the hurdle.

Only time will tell if that confidence persists. For now, Beauchamp noted, these companies should prepare for “decreased revenues and growth” in the United States.

“It remains unlikely that the U.S. can become completely self-sufficient in producing all the components required for advanced cardiovascular medical devices,” he said. “Without a more concrete and stable policy on these tariffs from the current American administration, it is likely that most manufacturers will be forced to continuously change their internal forecasts and production plans.”

Updates on trade disputes—and their impact on the global economy

There may be some good news on the horizon, according to new reports on the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China. One U.S. official told reporters that the latest talks between the two sides were a success. Chinese officials have said the same thing to the country’s own media.

On June 10, the World Bank Group officially predicted that the U.S. economy will grow half as fast in 2025 as it did in 2024. Trade disputes were specifically mentioned as a reason for that decrease in an official Global Economic Prospects report.

“Only six months ago, a ‘soft landing’ appeared to be in sight: the global economy was stabilizing after an extraordinary string of calamities both natural and man-made over the past few years,” according to the report’s foreword. “That moment has passed. The world economy today is once more running into turbulence. Without a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep. International discord—about trade, in particular—has upended many of the policy certainties that helped shrink extreme poverty and expand prosperity after the end of World War II.”",https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2024-08/istock-2060312303_1.jpg?h=140710cd&itok=iykcbjND,N,,2025-06-12 22:28:58.420686

United Natural Foods, a wholesale distributor that supplies Whole Foods and other grocers, said this week that a breach of its systems was disrupting its ability to fulfill orders—leaving many stores without certain items.

In the U.K., consumers could not order from the website of Marks & Spencer for more than six weeks—and found fewer in-store options after hackers targeted the British clothing, home goods and food retailer. A cyberattack on Co-op, a U.K. grocery chain, also led to empty shelves in some stores.

Cyberattacks have been on the rise across industries. But infiltrations of corporate technology carry their own set of implications when the target is a consumer-facing business.

Beyond potentially halting sales of physical goods, breaches can expose customers' personal data to future phishing or fraud attempts.

Here's what you need to know.

Cyberattacks are on the rise overall

Despite ongoing efforts from organizations to boost their cybersecurity defenses, experts note that cyberattacks continue to increase across the board.

In the past year, there's also been an ""uptick in the retail victims"" of such attacks, said Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a U.S. nonprofit.

""Cyber criminals are moving a little quicker than we are in terms of securing our systems,"" he said.

Ransomware attacks—in which hackers demand a hefty payment to restore hacked systems—account for a growing share of cyber crimes, experts note. And of course, retail isn't the only affected sector. Tracking by NCC Group, a global cybersecurity and software escrow firm, showed that industrial businesses were most often targeted for ransomware attacks in April, followed by companies in the ""consumer discretionary"" sector.

Attackers know there's a particular impact when going after well-known brands and products that shoppers buy or need every day, experts note.

""Creating that chaos and that panic with consumers puts pressure on the retailer,"" Steinhauer said, especially if there's a ransom demand involved.

Ade Clewlow, an associate director and senior adviser at the NCC Group, points specifically to food supply chain disruptions. Following the cyberattacks targeting M&S and Co-op, for example, supermarkets in remote areas of the U.K., where inventory already was strained, saw product shortages.

""People were literally going without the basics,"" Clewlow said.

Personal data is also at risk

Along with impacting business operations, cyber breaches may compromise customer data. The information can range from names and email addresses, to more sensitive data like credit card numbers, depending on the scope of the breach. Consumers therefore need to stay alert, according to experts.

""If (consumers have) given their personal information to these retailers, then they just have to be on their guard. Not just immediately, but really going forward,"" Clewlow said, noting that recipients of the data may try to commit fraud ""downstream.""

Fraudsters might send look-alike emails asking a retailer's account holders to change their passwords or promising fake promotions to get customers to click on a sketchy link. A good rule of thumb is to pause before opening anything and to visit the company's recognized website or call an official customer service hotline to verify the email, experts say.

It's also best not to reuse the same passwords across multiple websites—because if one platform is breached, that login information could be used to get into other accounts, through a tactic known as ""credential stuffing."" Steinhauer adds that using multifactor authentication, when available, and freezing your credit are also useful for added lines of defense.

Which companies have reported recent cybersecurity incidents?

A range of consumer-facing companies have reported cybersecurity incidents recently—including breaches that have caused some businesses to halt operations.

United Natural Foods, a major distributor for Whole Foods and other grocers across North America, took some of its systems offline after discovering ""unauthorized activity"" on June 5.

In a securities filing, the company said the incident had impacted its ""ability to fulfill and distribute customer orders."" United Natural Foods said in a Wednesday update that it was ""working steadily"" to gradually restore the services.

Still, that's meant leaner supplies of certain items this week. A Whole Foods spokesperson told The Associated Press via email that it was working to restock shelves as soon as possible. The Amazon-owned grocer's partnership with United Natural Foods currently runs through May 2032.

Meanwhile, a security breach detected by Victoria's Secret last month led the popular lingerie seller to shut down its U.S. shopping site for nearly four days, as well as to halt some in-store services. Victoria's Secret later disclosed that its corporate systems also were affected, too, causing the company to delay the release of its first quarter earnings.

Several British retailers—M&S, Harrods and Co-op—have all pointed to impacts of recent cyberattacks. The attack targeting M&S, which was first reported around Easter weekend, stopped it from processing online orders and also emptied some store shelves.

The company estimated last month that the it would incur costs of 300 million pounds ($400 million) from the attack. But progress towards recovery was shared Tuesday, when M&S announced that some of its online order operations were back—with more set to be added in the coming weeks.

Other breaches exposed customer data, with brands like Adidas, The North Face and reportedly Cartier all disclosing that some contact information was compromised recently.

In a statement, The North Face said it discovered a ""small-scale credential stuffing attack"" on its website in April. The company reported that no credit card data was compromised and said the incident, which impacted 1,500 consumers, was ""quickly contained.""

Meanwhile, Adidas disclosed last month that an ""unauthorized external party"" obtained some data, which was mostly contact information, through a third-party customer service provider.

Whether or not the incidents are connected is unknown. Experts like Steinhauer note that hackers sometimes target a piece of software used by many different companies and organizations. But the range of tactics used could indicate the involvement of different groups.

Companies' language around cyberattacks and security breaches also varies—and may depend on what they know when. But many don't immediately or publicly specify whether ransomware was involved.

Still, Steinhauer says the likelihood of ransomware attacks is ""pretty high"" in today's cybersecurity landscape—and key indicators can include businesses taking their systems offline or delaying financial reporting.

Overall, experts say it's important to build up ""cyber hygiene"" defenses and preparations across organizations.

""Cyber is a business risk, and it needs to be treated that way,"" Clewlow said.

The new store replaces the former Barnes & Noble at the mall, which closed last year. It is on the first floor of Tysons Corner Center, across from H&M.

Barnes & Noble said the new store is slightly smaller than its previous Tysons store, but has nearly as many bookcases. It also includes a B&N Cafe.

Author David Baldacci will cut the grand opening ribbon at the store on Wednesday, and will be signing books, including his newest, Strangers in Time. Baldacci’s books have sold more than 150 million copies.

The new Tysons store extends Barnes & Noble’s significant comeback. After steadily closing stores for 15 consecutive years, it opened more new bookstores in 2024 than it did in an entire decade from 2009 to 2019. The chain is on track to open 60 new stores across the country this year.

Barnes & Noble has 20 stores in the D.C. region currently, one of its largest markets. Its high-profile Georgetown store opened last summer at 3040 M Street NW, the exact same building where it closed in 2011.

If you're a Costco Canada Executive Member, you'll receive a $10 credit each month when you place an online order on Sameday.costco.ca or through Instacart. The credit is then automatically applied when you place an order worth $150 or more.

Reclaiming the Third Place

Niccol opened the session by asking Schultz about the relevance of the third place in today’s world. Schultz responded by acknowledging global anxiety and uncertainty, noting that Starbucks role as a community anchor is more vital than ever.

“The third place is not something we need to reinvent — it’s who we are,” Schultz said. “People all over the world are longing for human connection… We are a company that is steeped in humanity. We are steeped in human connection, because of all of you and the people you represent.”

Schultz, who led Starbucks from a small Seattle roastery to a global brand with over 40,000 stores and nearly 500,000 partners, emphasized the need to reclaim Starbucks soul. “We’re not a company that needs AI to do what we do. It’s an enabler. What we need to do, is just be ourselves — be the people that we’ve been,” he said.

“Take it personal. Understand your responsibility to every customer and partner. That’s how we win.”

Performance Through the Lens of Humanity

Schultz passionately defended the idea that performance and humanity are not mutually exclusive. Reflecting on Starbucks growth from 11 stores in 1987 to 40,000 today, he said:

“We’ve always been a performance-driven company through the lens of humanity. That’s how we create opportunity.”

“This is a magical time [to be at Starbucks] … and I believe that when you go back to your store and extend everything you’ve learned to your partners … we’re going to come out of here like a tidal wave!”

The Two Chairs: Partners and Customers

One of the most memorable metaphors from the session was Schultz’s “two chairs” concept — a reminder that every decision should consider both the partner and the customer.

“If a decision doesn’t exceed expectations for both, we don’t do it. That’s our responsibility.”

Back to Starbucks: Coffee at the Core

Niccol and Schultz discussed the Back to Starbucks strategy, which centers on coffee excellence – the best coffee, served by the best baristas, in the best coffeehouses. Schultz emphasized that Starbucks must remain a coffee-first company.

“When I heard you speak for the first time about Back to Starbucks, I did a cartwheel in my living room!” said Schultz. “It’s short, it’s to the point, and it’s exactly the tip of the spear of who we should be, and who we are. And we are above all else, a coffee company.”

“The craft of coffee has to be front and center…we must differentiate ourselves through coffee. With coffee as the foundation, there are so many things we can do that create opportunities for the company, but the foundation must be coffee. Our core purpose and reason for being is to exceed the expectations of one customer and one partner at a time.”

The Mind of a Merchant

Schultz recounted his formative trip to Italy in 1983, where he was inspired by the artistry and attention to detail in Italian coffee bars. He urged leaders to embrace the “mind of a merchant” — focusing on quality, a welcoming environment and connection.

“People buy with their eyes. Create a multi-sensory experience; a sense of community that only we can create.”

Culture, Standards and Opportunity

Schultz closed with a call to action for each partner in the arena: be a culture carrier. He stressed that Starbucks success is not an entitlement — it must be earned every day through attention to detail and personal responsibility.

“The culture, the values, the guiding principles, the heritage is what built the brand. The responsibility of everyone in this room is to be a culture carrier. Respect the heritage and tradition, take care of your people, exceed the expectations of your customers and be steeped in coffee.”

“Everyone in this room has the power to make a difference. All you have to do is make a personal difference in the life of your partners, the life of your customers, and everything else is going to follow.”

A Tidal Wave of Optimism

Schultz ended with a message of hope and determination:

“Our success is not an entitlement – it must be earned,” said Schultz, adding, “I’ve never been more optimistic about Starbucks future. Take it back. Be true to the coffee. Be true to your partners. Let’s surprise the world again.”",https://about.starbucks.com/uploads/2025/06/Starbucks-LE-25-Howard-3-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 00:06:40.470928

The analysis tracked the prices of five popular baby gear categories: car seats, bassinets, strollers, high chairs and baby monitors.
The committee's report tracked the prices of the most popular Amazon listings for products from five of Babylist's categories of baby goods.
Of the five items studied, the Graco car seat saw the highest price increase.
Executives from Newell said during an April 30 earnings call that the company had raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%.","The cost of some baby gear has risen in recent weeks due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies, according to a new congressional report.

The cost of five common items bought for babies has increased 24%, or by $98 combined, between April 1 — the day before Trump's sweeping April 2 tariff announcement — and June 9, according to the analysis by the Joint Economic Committee's minority arm.

The analysis tracked the prices of five popular baby gear categories: car seats, bassinets, strollers, high chairs and baby monitors. It leaned on data from baby registry website Babylist.

""New parents already have their budgets stretched thin by all the products that they have to buy for their child – the last thing they need is a new tax on babies created by President Trump,"" said Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., ranking member of the committee, in a media release.

The findings come as companies grapple with Trump's ever-changing tariff policies. Some have said they will work to mitigate the impact of the levies and offset the costs to consumers, meanwhile, others, including Best Buy and Costco , have said they already raised some prices. Walmart and Target said they plan to hike prices on some items.

Baby gear sold in the U.S. is specifically at risk of tariff impact because 97% of strollers and 87% of car seats are manufactured in China, according to Babylist.

The committee's report tracked the prices of the most popular Amazon listings for products from five of Babylist's categories of baby goods. The Amazon bestsellers included items from brands Graco, AirClub, Summer by Ingenuity, Evenflo and HelloBaby. The report measured the price increases over time using the price-checking websites Keepa.com and Camelcamelcamel.com.

Of the five items studied, the Graco car seat saw the highest price increase. The Graco SnugRide Lite LX Infant Car Seat got 44.8% more expensive over the measured time period. Prices for the other products that were reviewed rose between 10% and 30%.

A spokesperson for Graco owner Newell Brands told CNBC in a statement that the report appears to have started collecting data on the Graco car seat during a period when retailers were running a promotion.

The spokesperson said the car seat was on sale on April 1, so the price was hiked by about $20, not by $43, as suggested in the report.

Executives from Newell said during an April 30 earnings call that the company had raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%. The company said at the time it was equipped to handle Trump's tariffs, excluding hypothetical further hikes on imports from China.

A broader Babylist analysis of 11 categories, including products like bouncers and diaper bags, found that costs increased by an average of $400 combined between March 10 and June 3. Those higher prices for new parent households in the U.S. amounts to $875.2 million in total additional costs, according to the analysis and based on data from the American Community Survey.

The study found particular risk for parents in California, with parents in that state collectively facing a potential $100.3 million in additional baby costs this year. That was followed by Texas at $85.3 million, Florida at $48.5 million and New York at $48.4 million, according to the report.

""Just in the last two months, the tariffs have made things even more difficult for new parents, forcing them to shoulder higher prices for car seats and other items that they absolutely need to keep their babies safe,"" Hassan said in a statement to CNBC. ""And the tariffs are already forcing some businesses to choose between laying off workers, raising prices for customers, or closing altogether.""

Who do you trust more to ship for consumers in healthcare – Amazon, CVS, or neither?","CVS’ $20B Consumer Pivot

CVS, the company with over $370B in revenue yet an $80B market cap, the company known as ‘3-letter’ to pharmacists, the company which operates a slowly dying retail footprint, the company which felt so threatened by Mark Cuban’s side hustle they felt the need to write out a full op-ed in Fortune, the company with 30%+ PBM market share, a segment of healthcare known for the most opaque economic practices known to mankind, and the company that has returned nothing to shareholders (outside of dividends) over the past 5 years…wants to make things easier for the healthcare consumer – and it is investing $20B over the next decade to do so.

Glaringly missing from its $20B consumer roadmap is the obvious need to make CVS Caremark, the largest PBM by market share, more transparent.

In general, non-competitive, consolidated markets lead to bad consumer experience. Vertical integration leads to patient steerage. While these dynamics CAN work to create a more cohesive, streamlined experience and perhaps more favorable situations for CVS-specific patients, in this walled garden ecosystem with basket-style pricing economics, CVS with its scale and business tactics tend toward anti-competitive practices. Plus they’re…pretty good at preserving margin and moving money away from rebates (hotly attacked in recent memory) to GPO management fees or specialty pharmacy fees (the largest growth vector nowadays) – from a great breakdown from Optum’s Advisory Board (and originally Nephron reporting):

“While contributions from commercial rebate retention decreased from 46% of estimated profit in 2012 to 13% in 2022 as a greater share of rebates were passed through to plan sponsors, the share of PBM profits derived from fees that are less likely to be shared with plan sponsors has grown from 5% in 2012 to 22% in 2023…

Putting it all together, we find that while increased pass through of rebates and price protection to plan sponsors have reduced these traditional sources of PBM profitability, novel PBM fees associated with contracting entities [GPOs] are more than offsetting this decline while expansion of specialty pharmacy is now the leading driver of PBM profit growth.” – Nephron Research, Trends in Profitability and Compensation of PBMs & PBM Contracting Entities

Alright. My quips are over – I promise. In an industry with scarcity and allocation of resources, someone has to be the bad guy to be a check on provider/pharma overutilization, and CVS just so happens to operate two extremely large ‘villain’ figures in healthcare – insurance and PBMs.

This rabbit hole aside, credit where credit is due for management around recognizing that CVS needs to reorient its consumer experience. Let’s dive into how they’re trying to achieve just that, since there are some interesting takeaways. While the original article is scant on details, a big part of CVS’ consumer-oriented strategy appears to be focused on interoperability: actually playing nice in the ecosystem.

Various administrations have attempted to encourage the industry to do this over the years, and a number of startups have attempted to develop platforms to host such an environment. But all have been unsuccessful for one key reason, said Tilak Mandadi, CVS Health’s chief experience and technology officer: Companies have been unwilling to shake things up.”

Wait…is that a CVS executive who just said that?

(alright, NOW I’m done)

CVS wants to embed its consumers into its ecosystem, and that means a more integrated, streamlined experience across the enterprise – pharmacists and Oak Street Health clinicians have complete longitudinal patient records; consumers know upfront prices; better notifications or communication; using AI as a call center extender; etc.

For AI, CVS laid out specific guardrails:

Never use AI for clinical diagnosis

Never use AI for prior auth / denials

Never use AI to prevent human touch

So, long story short, sounds like CVS will never use AI!

As far as CVS’ consumer-oriented strategy and vision is concerned, I’ll believe it when I see it. Actions speak louder than words, and I sure have seen a lot of words from CVS lately. This isn’t to rag on the initiative but more of a ‘raised eyebrows’ challenge at the company at the center of PBM disruption and opacity.

Inside Amazon Pharmacy’s Relentless focus on the Consumer

Here’s a company with a relentless focus on the consumer, and has held this core belief since its inception: Amazon.

Amazon, the company which has devoted every piece of capital in the name of its customers, the company which generates $630B+ in annual revenue and is worth over $2 trillion in market cap with a 65% return over the past 5 years (not market beating, to be fair), is slowly working its way deeper into the healthcare services industry.

Since acquiring PillPack in 2018 and launching Amazon Pharmacy in 2020, Amazon has emphasized affordability and transparency in pharmacy practices, initially targeting those paying cash, then moving into Medicare and directly competing with CVS’ retail pharmacy on both fronts. For Amazon, the end goal is always the consumer with an endless pursuit of making things easier for Amazon customers – even in healthcare, where incumbents don’t play nice.

Amazon bought PillPack to be a consumer healthcare platform play, and they’ve been building it that way ever since, launching transparent products like RxPass and overpaying for acquiring consumer-forward companies like One Medical:

“[Amazon’s Nader] Kabbani shared [TJ] Parker’s concern about the pharmacy industry and the dominant players’ inability or unwillingness to put the consumer first.”

So, Amazon Pharmacy is reshaping the healthcare landscape by leveraging its unique strengths in digital consumer experience, logistics, and technology-enabled simplification. I talked to Amazon Pharmacy’s John Love last week who was a wealth of information on what they’ve been up to, including PillPack’s move into Medicare and also around enabling caregivers to support loved ones by allowing them to manage medication.

Today Amazon is working receive access to PBM APIs so that members can access their benefits and know their price estimates. Notably, despite efforts to integrate directly with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to streamline copay estimates and claims, the largest three PBMs have yet to fully partner with Amazon, signaling ongoing resistance and complexities in data-sharing and transparency. Let’s just assume they’re worried about…API security.

Amazon has asked the PBMs for this access and all 3 of the big PBMs have “understood the request.”

Currently, Amazon Pharmacy serves approximately 1 in 4 customers through real-time benefit checks. Where they don’t have perfect information, the platform analyzes past claims data and other information to copays, leveraging machine learning to do so. Fascinatingly, simply by ESTIMATING copays for customers, Amazon learned they could improve medication adherence. Explain to me exactly why PBMs would be against that? (But really, if there’s a legitimate reason I’d love to know).

Amazon Pharmacy’s new offerings, PrimeRx, RxPass, and RxCoupon, illustrate Amazon’s consumer-centric approach across healthcare which has a simple goal: simplify, simplify, simplify. The team continues to recognize broken or failing aspects of the pharmacy value chain for the consumer. Quality of experience at the retail pharmacy is dismal. Mail order hasn’t evolved. So they set out a goal to get every U.S. citizen medication as quickly as possible, safely.

To that end, Amazon Pharmacy is scaling rapidly in logistical capabilities, integrating pharmacies directly into its vast logistical network to enable same-day medication delivery. By embedding pharmacies within distribution hubs, they’ve reduced delivery times from 2 days to 2-6 hours, launching services initially in urban hubs such as Seattle, New York, and Austin, with plans to build a new pharmacy operation every 18 days into major urban areas over the course of 2025.

I’m also pumped personally to hear the state of Texas approved drone delivery, which should only serve to increase medication access. But I’d love to eventually see these capabilities extend to rural areas.

In tandem with its logistical growth, Amazon continues to expand its pharmacy business through strategic partnerships, including a notable agreement with Eli Lilly as a dispensing partner and Blue Cross of California. Additionally, Amazon’s latest feature enhancements, like caregiver functionalities and Medicare-compatible payment options, directly respond to growing consumer demands for convenience, affordability, and transparency. When asking John how Amazon’s team prioritizes platform features, he noted they develop a composite score, involving the following questions and more:

What’s the total potential impact of this feature?

How can we improve medication adherence, access, and affordability? What are the edge cases?

How much time is the consumer saving?

Amazon’s broader ambition remains clear: to fundamentally transform the consumer healthcare experience. With significant logistical strengths, Amazon Pharmacy seeks to remove administrative burdens – automating data entry, streamlining billing processes, and reducing pharmacy deserts.

“We want the pharmacy to be as simple as shopping on Amazon is…make what should be simple…simple.”

In essence, Amazon Pharmacy’s expansion and innovative approach underline healthcare’s shift towards consumerism, and despite ongoing friction with major PBMs, the trajectory suggests continued disruption as Amazon leverages its considerable technological and logistical resources to reshape the patient pharmacy experience.

And it looks like incumbents are taking notice as consumers demand more from their healthcare services.

“[Customers] really want to trust and engage with companies that have earned the right to be in healthcare,” [now-former CEO Karen Lynch] said. “I think about Amazon as sort of a transactional company today.”

“We welcome competition.” – now-CEO David Joyner

This isn’t intended to be a CVS slam piece or an Amazon puff piece. It’s intended to be a …”who is making the consumer experience in healthcare better?” piece. And so far, it seems as if Amazon is doing a hell of a better job, but CVS has the immense incumbency and assets to deliver incredible impact.

Who do you trust more to ship for consumers in healthcare – Amazon, CVS, or neither?

This means that, if plans hold, we may soon be able to fly cross-country at Mach speeds.

1973 Overland Flight Ban

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) banned commercial supersonic flights over land in 1973 due to the disruptive sonic booms they created. The last time humans regularly flew supersonically was with the Concorde, which cleverly got around this restriction by flying at those speeds only over the ocean.

Ultimately, Concorde was retired in 2003 because of high operating costs, noise concerns, and limited routes. But now, this flight option is back on the table—and it makes sense given the leaps in technology and modern air travel demands.

New Executive Order on Flight Ban

According to the new orders, the FAA must scrap the 1973 rule prohibiting flights faster than Mach 1 over land, as long as the aircraft keeps noise below the sonic boom threshold.

Advances in engineering now allow for “boomless” supersonic flight—planes that fly fast but stay quiet. Thanks to these new orders, industry players like Boom Supersonic, which is developing the XB-1 demonstrator, expect rapid progress.

Supersonic Technology

Developers are designing planes with special shapes and technologies that minimize or redirect shockwaves so that the sonic boom either doesn’t happen at all or isn’t heard on the ground. The XB-1 prototype hit Mach 1.1 last January without a sonic boom reaching the ground, showing that quieter supersonic travel is achievable.

Removing speed restrictions will let companies like Boom Supersonic quickly move forward with development of commercial supersonic jets—like its upcoming Overture airliner, which is set to fly at Mach 1.7 and drastically cut travel times.

Drones and eVTOLs

While not supersonic, the orders also create a task force to better secure U.S. airspace from unsafe drone activity, particularly around big events like the Olympics or the World Cup.

Plans include enabling drone flights beyond visual line-of-sight and supporting electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), developed by companies such as Joby and Archer, aimed at future urban air mobility.

Implications

Supersonic jets could serve diplomatic or military purposes, and help make the U.S. a world leader in the sector. Improved drone regulations can also reduce reliance on foreign drone tech—especially from China—and strengthen national security.

Of course, challenges remain, including costs, fuel efficiency, and making sure that the noise standards are met, but these advances are a big step in the right direction for speedy air travel.

Both of those incidents involved older Boeing 737-800 aircrafts — and occurred while Air India was still under governmental control.
Over recent years, Air India redesigned its branding and ordered hundreds of new planes from both Boeing and Airbus.
""This is a difficult day for all of us at Air India,"" CEO Campbell Wilson said in recorded remarks.
A single passenger survived the crash, according to a senior Indian official and Air India.","The deadly crash of an Air India flight carrying more than 240 people on Thursday arrives after years of efforts to turn around the country's flag carrier — which had been plagued by tragedy and financial losses under prior state ownership.

In 2010, an Air India flight arriving from Dubai overshot the runway in the city of Mangalore and plunged over a cliff, killing 158 people out of the 166 on board. And in 2020, a flight for Air India Express, a subsidiary of Air India, skidded off a runway in Southern India during heavy rain and cracked in two — killing 18 people and injuring more than 120 others.

Both of those incidents involved older Boeing 737-800 aircrafts — and occurred while Air India was still under governmental control. Indian conglomerate Tata Sons took over Air India in 2022, returning the carrier to private ownership after it was run by the state for decades.

The 180 billion rupee (then worth $2.4 billion) deal was in some ways a homecoming for Air India, with roots that date back to the Tata family's founding of what was then-called Tata Airlines in 1932. It was also part of an wider effort to save the airline — which had become a money-losing, debt-saddled operation.

Jitendra Bhargava, former executive director of the airline and author of “The Descent of Air India,” said government ownership fostered an archaic work culture, outdated processes, and management by bureaucrats unfamiliar with the aviation industry.

“You are getting a recipe for disaster. And we went through it,"" Bhargava told The Associated Press. As a result, he said, the company hemorrhaged money — which had a “cascading effect” because it couldn’t invest in upgrades.

By the time of the Tata Sons takeover, Air India’s market share was around 12% and at risk of shrinking as competitors expanded. Bhargava and other aviation experts stress that shedding government control was necessary for Air India to compete with other private rivals — and the carrier has since worked to reinvent itself by modernizing both its operations and fleet.

Over recent years, Air India redesigned its branding and ordered hundreds of new planes from both Boeing and Airbus. Analysts don't expect Thursday's crash, which involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to change such partnerships.

""Admittedly, Air India and the Tata organization have been very proud about the fact that they’ve made a major commitment to Boeing,"" said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and leadership consultant.

While acknowledging that Boeing has been bruised in recent years, largely due to problems with its 737 Max, Mendiratta noted that there's still been a ""hunger"" from airlines around the world to add the company's new planes to their fleets after recent delivery delays. That includes demand for the 787 Dreamliner — which, she said, is ""one of the most important aircraft when it comes to sustainable aviation, emissions reduction, managing the costs of aviation.""

Boeing has been plagued by its own safety issues, including past deadly crashes. This, however, was the first crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. And the cause of Thursday's crash is still unclear.

An international investigation is underway, and Boeing has said it's “working to gather more information.” Air India said it's also working to get answers around what caused the crash — while promising to support those impacted by the tragedy.

""This is a difficult day for all of us at Air India,"" CEO Campbell Wilson said in recorded remarks. ""Our efforts now are focused entirely on the needs of our passengers, crew members, their families and loved ones.""

Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, added in a statement that ""no words can adequately express the grief we feel at this moment."" He said that the company would provide 10 million rupees (nearly $116,795) to the families of each person ""who has lost their life in this tragedy"" — and also cover medical expenses of anyone who was injured.

The Boeing 787 crashed into a medical college after takeoff in India's northwestern city of Ahmedabad. A single passenger survived the crash, according to a senior Indian official and Air India. But the airline said there were no other survivors — putting the latest death toll at 241.

Beyond the fatal accidents in 2010 and 2020, an Air India Boeing 747 flight also crashed into the Arabian Sea in 1978, killing all 213 aboard.

The carrier was under government control from 1953 through 2022.

Other fatal accidents involving India’s state-owned airlines include the more than 50 people who died in a crash in the eastern city of Patna in 2000. In 1993, a flight crashed in the western city Aurangabad, killing 55. In 1988, over 130 died when a plane crashed while landing in Ahmedabad and in 1991, a crash near northeastern city Imphal killed 69 people aboard.

Retailers: ‘We’re committed to good-faith bargaining’ Spokespeople for both Kroger and Albertsons said they remain committed to good faith bargaining in their contract negotiations.","Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union in Southern California and the Pacific Northwest voted this week to authorize a strike against the local chains owned by Kroger and Albertsons in their markets.

They were among the 60,000 workers voting simultaneously to authorize strikes across multiple markets, making the votes the largest coordinated strike authorization in UFCW history, according to Labor Notes.

The retailers have been negotiating new contracts for several months with union locals representing tens of thousands of workers, who are seeking staffing increases and wage and benefit improvements. Workers are also alleging unfair labor practices during the negotiations, including surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation against union members.

Meanwhile, Safeway/Albertsons workers in Colorado who belong to UFCW Local 7 authorized an unfair labor practices strike last week, and on Wednesday the union issued a 72-hour strike notice and canceled the current contract extension, effective at 11:59 p.m. on Saturday. Workers at Kroger-owned King Soopers and City Market stores in Colorado could also go on strike, according to UFCW Local 7. Those workers previously staged a two-week strike in February, also alleging unfair labor practices.

Kroger workers in Indiana also rejected the company’s most recent contract offer last week but have not yet authorized a strike.

Widespread UFCW, Teamsters contract talks ongoing

More than 150,000 UFCW and Teamsters grocery store workers are currently negotiating for new collective bargaining agreements across the country. Strikes have received widespread worker support, including 99% in metro Denver, according to UFW Local 7.

“At the bargaining table, [Albertsons] is holding hands with King Soopers and City Market to propose major cuts to workers’ healthcare benefits, and to threaten the financial security of our pension beneficiaries on fixed incomes, while continuing to reject meaningful efforts to address chronic understaffing in stores,” said Kim Cordova , president of UFCW Local 7.

In Southern California, more than 90% of workers who are members of UFCW Local 135 in San Diego voted to authorize a strike, the union said. Bargaining is scheduled to continue there later this month.

Retailers: ‘We’re committed to good-faith bargaining’

Spokespeople for both Kroger and Albertsons said they remain committed to good faith bargaining in their contract negotiations.

“We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption,” a Kroger spokesperson told Supermarket News. “Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.”

Albertsons also issued a statement saying that it “respects the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining” and is committed to reaching an agreement “that is fair to its employees, good for its customers and allows the company to remain competitive.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/blt41efd78c623d6c2c/684b2555804720b079ee3cc3/NEWKroger-Albertsons-logo.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-12 22:15:30.357834

By Amos Harris

Monrovia, Liberia – June 12, 2025 – Despite continuous proclamations of a multi-billion-dollar investment in Liberia, ArcelorMittal Liberia faces mounting criticism as its contractors reportedly endure squalid living conditions in host communities. These harsh realities starkly contrast with the company’s public relations narrative of progress and significant contributions to the nation’s development.

During a press briefing held today at the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT), ArcelorMittal’s top executives highlighted their purported $3.5 billion investment in Liberia since 2006, touting it as “one of the largest ArcelorMittal has ever made on the continent.” However, Chief Operating Officer Anthony P. Kocken and his colleagues offered no substantive explanation for the inhumane and degrading conditions faced by Liberian contractors. Many of these essential workers are reportedly housed in makeshift, dilapidated structures lacking basic amenities such as running water, electricity, and proper sanitation.

This disconnect between corporate rhetoric and on-the-ground reality has sparked outrage among local communities and rights advocates. While ArcelorMittal pledges to boost employment, improve infrastructure, and invest in health and education, residents of Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa Counties – where the company operates – continue to question the tangible impact of these claims. Many argue that the company’s activities have primarily served to extract Liberia’s resources rather than genuinely foster its development.

General Manager of Mines, Jallah Selena, asserted the company’s “good standing” with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory bodies. Yet, local environmental groups have repeatedly condemned ArcelorMittal’s mining operations for alleged damage to local ecosystems and pollution of nearby water sources. Selena’s claim that the company has no financial liabilities to students or the Liberian government also drew skepticism, with persistent allegations of mismanagement and uneven distribution of the Social Development Fund intended for impacted counties.

Rebecca Kwabo, Head of Human Resources, reiterated the company’s narrative of increasing local employment. However, this assertion rings hollow for numerous contractors who reportedly work under precarious and exploitative terms, characterized by little to no job security and limited opportunities for advancement.

Perhaps the most glaring issue remains the company’s apparent refusal to address the unacceptable living conditions of its workers. While executives boast of multi-million-dollar contributions and partnerships, the individuals generating the company’s wealth are forced to reside in what can only be described as “misfit structures” – a stark embarrassment for a company profiting immensely from Liberia’s rich mineral resources.

Marcus Wleh, Head of Sustainability and External Relations, claimed ongoing collaboration with community stakeholders to ensure the fair distribution of development funds. However, numerous community leaders have reported little evidence of such collaboration, demanding greater transparency and accountability.

Despite COO Kocken’s pledge to increase the company’s annual contribution to the national budget from $30 million to $100 million, critics argue that monetary promises on paper are meaningless unless they translate into tangible improvements for the Liberian people on the ground. As ArcelorMittal Liberia continues to cultivate its public image and celebrate its partnership with the Boakai administration, the voices of the contractors – those living in squalor while building the company’s fortune – remain largely unheard and unaddressed.

As a fast-food leader, Taco Bell decided to enter the chicken game. However, it isn't just hopping on a trend; it's creating a version with its own unmistakable flavor.

Taco Bell enters the chicken trend by launching Crispy Chicken Nuggets

Crispy Chicken Nuggets first debuted on Taco Bell's menu in December of last year, and while available, they made up nearly one in six orders. This menu item was so successful that almost 5 million customers tried it, which caused it to sell out nationwide in under a week.

The product's success might be due to its uniqueness, since Taco Bell tested over 50 recipes and flavor combinations to make the nuggets stand out from the rest.

Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets are made with all-white meat chicken marinated in jalapeño buttermilk and coated in a crunchy tortilla-chip and breadcrumb blend.

Because of how much fans love the Crispy Chicken Nuggets, Taco Bell relaunched them for a limited time in April. The demand was so overwhelming that it decided to expand the product even further.

Yum! Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell is launching the new Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos, featuring the fan-favorite Crispy Chicken Nuggets in strip form.

The Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos are filled with Crispy Chicken Strips, purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo, and shredded cheddar cheese, all folded or wrapped inside a warm tortilla.

Everyone knows no Taco Bell meal is complete without a good dipping sauce, so in addition to the new items, the fast-food chain is also introducing two new sauces: Spicy Ranchero and Avocado Ranch.

“Crispy chicken is having a moment, but our fans made it a movement,” said Taco Bell’s Chief Marketing Officer Taylor Montgomery in a press release. “So, we decided to bring our sell-out Nuggets recipe to the formats that defined our brand because true innovation means elevating the icons, not replacing them. We’re not like every other chicken spot out there; we’re doing crispy chicken the only way we know how: full of flavor and unmistakably Taco Bell.""

ID28,Nike,2025-06-12 18:45:07+00:00,Gear Patrol,"How Nike and the World's Fastest Runner Plan to Break the 4-Minute Mile, Using Science",Jack Seemer,,,,,https://www.gearpatrol.com/outdoors/nike-faith-kipyegon-breaking4-mile-shoes-apparel-innovations/,"Seven seconds into the unknown This isn’t the first time Nike has supported one of its athletes in pursuit of athletic history.
To run a four-minute mile, Kipyegon will need to shave at least 7.64 seconds off her own world record (set in 2023).
“We know that shoe can go at least four minutes and seven seconds,” said Carrie Dimoff, who oversees innovations in footwear for Nike.
Kipyegon’s shoes don’t need to last an entire season, so long as they hold up three minutes and 59 seconds.
Like with the Vaporfly, Kirby, Gibson and Dimoff all believe that their findings will inform future design decisions not just by Nike but the industry at large.","As a problem to be solved, the four-minute mile is not a matter of will but science.

Make no mistake: when Roger Bannister became the first human in history to run 1609 meters in three minutes and 59 seconds, he possessed no shortage of talent nor grit.

But Bannister, a 25-year-old medical student at the time, famously focused on physiology, tailoring his training and performance around efficiency — decades before the Vaporfly made it the trendiest buzzword in running.

On June 26, some 70 years later, Faith Kipyegon will attempt to do the same when she races to become the first woman in history to break the four-minute barrier.

And, just like Bannister, she’s relying on science to take her there.

Only this time, Kipyegon can count on the backing of the world’s largest sportswear company, which will outfit the Kenyan in state-of-the-art footwear and apparel developed behind closed doors at its innovation lab in Beaverton, Oregon.

Seven seconds into the unknown

This isn’t the first time Nike has supported one of its athletes in pursuit of athletic history.

The company famously developed its Vaporfly super shoe for a high-profile time trial in 2017 called Breaking2, when three runners attempted to run a marathon in under two hours.

One of them, of course, was Eliud Kipchoge, who eventually accomplished the feat in a follow-up called the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, wearing Nike’s sequel to the Vaporfly.

To run a four-minute mile, Kipyegon will need to shave at least 7.64 seconds off her own world record (set in 2023). And while the marathon and mile are two different beasts, the difficulty of the task isn’t far from the one that faced Kipchoge in 2017, even if the scales seem far apart on paper.

“Maybe not everybody in the general public would understand just seven seconds or eight seconds, but it is huge when put on the edge of a four-minute effort,” Brett Kirby told Gear Patrol in an exclusive interview.

Kirby is the Senior Principal of Performance Exploration Research in the Nike Sport Research Lab and one of the key players in the team supporting Kipyegon in her attempt, which Nike is calling Breaking4. (He also worked on Breaking2 and featured prominently in the National Geographic documentary detailing the project.)

“If you look at what you’d need to get to four minutes, you fall roughly in the ballpark of around three percent,” Kirby added. If you remove Kipyegon from the equation, it climbs almost double; Sifan Hassan was the previous record holder, with a personal best of four minutes and 12.33 seconds.

According to Kirby, the thing that makes the mile so difficult to crack is its reliance on “multiple energy systems,” he said, noting the importance of both aerobic efficiency and and pure power.

“That’s what makes it super complicated and complex because it’s riding this bubble of saying, ‘I have to be good not only at speed but also endurance, and then I have this element of blending those two,'” Kirby added.

Nike’s most aerodynamic apparel solution, ever

To support Kipyegon, Kirby and the greater Nike innovation team will bring the full might of their sports science backgrounds, starting with a bespoke apparel solution that includes a one-piece suit, headband, 3D printed bra and arm sleeves.

The suit’s halo feature are small synthetic half-circles of varying heights, strategically placed around Kipyegon’s shoulders and hips. Nike calls them Aeronodes and the goal is to create “controlled turbulence,” said Lisa Gibson, who helped to oversee their development, in an interview.

“They’re placed specifically where we want the air to flow more smoothly and stay close to the body,” Gibson added. “What that does is it creates smaller eddies behind the body, which reduces drag.”

Eddies are effectively small, chaotic pockets of air that develop in the wake of a moving object, and they “can almost feel like you’re being pulled back,” Gibson said. “So the Aeronodes result in smaller eddies, which reduces drag and results in a smoother flow downstream.”

Other decisions were made to facilitate marginal gains, such as placing the seams of the suit on the back, as opposed to the sides. The effect wasn’t just speed but comfort, which ultimately became Nike’s North Star during the myriad prototyping phases.

“We wanted to make sure that this is incredibly comfortable for Faith because we didn’t want any distractions to take away from what she’s trying to do,” Gibson said. “The team had to go through a lot of iterations to make sure it was not only optimized for aerodynamics but also optimized for faith and her comfort.”

Finding Faith’s feet

The emphasis on comfort becomes especially critical on Faith’s feet, as her shoes will be the things making contact with the track at the Stade Charléty in Paris — the setting of her Breaking4 attempt.

And while they boast some state-of-the-art upgrades, they are heavily based off of Nike’s Victory middle-distance super spikes, which Kipyegon used to set the current world record in 2023.

“We know that shoe can go at least four minutes and seven seconds,” said Carrie Dimoff, who oversees innovations in footwear for Nike. “But the team obviously wanted to consider could we improve upon it.”

That meant re-evaluating every aspect and material of the shoe, looking for whatever gains were there to be found.

“We had a lot of ideas that hadn’t yet made it into commercial product,” Dimoff said, starting with one of Nike’s chief technological innovations: the Zoom Air unit.

During her attempt, Kipyegon will wear shoes that include a Air Zoom unit that’s 3mm taller than the one found in the existing Victory 2 model.

“The height of the Zoom Air unit is related to how much energy it can store in return. As Faith runs down the track, she loads that airbag with her own energy. These airbags are over ninety percent efficient, so with every step, she’s getting more of that back.”

It’s not the only attribute Dimoff and the crew rethought. They also redesigned the upper, swapping out Nike’s existing Atomknit for one made from even lighter-weight yarns, and increased the number of spikes from four to six.

Even the carbon outsole plate is new.

“The existing plate was designed for commercialization. It was designed to be worn for multiple races throughout the length of a season by athletes of all levels,” Dimoff said.

Kipyegon’s shoes don’t need to last an entire season, so long as they hold up three minutes and 59 seconds.

But that isn’t to say the innovations bred by Breaking4 won’t tickle into consumer products. Like with the Vaporfly, Kirby, Gibson and Dimoff all believe that their findings will inform future design decisions not just by Nike but the industry at large.",https://www.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/nike-faith-kipyegon-gear-patrol-lead-jpg.webp,N,,2025-06-12 22:33:29.071519

The company has been the IOC's cloud technology provider for the past three Olympic cycles, including the 2024 Paris Olympics.
For the Paris Olympics alone, that meant managing around 11,000 hours of video.
""Last Olympics was the first time cloud technology had overtaken satellite broadcasting technology, and that technology is all supported by Alibaba,"" Tsai said.","Joe Tsai, co-founder and chairman of Alibaba Group, believes China's edge in artificial intelligence is rooted not only in technical capability but also in its fast-moving consumer internet sector and the intensity of its engineering culture.

Speaking at VivaTech 2025 in Paris on Wednesday during a wide-ranging conversation with Maurice Levy, emeritus chairman of Publicis Groupe, Tsai pointed to the local internet environment as a key driver.

""When you look at the Chinese market, starting with some of the early internet companies, China has always been very good at adopting and iterating new technology, especially in the consumer internet space,"" he said.

He noted that China's internet ecosystem, built around platforms like Taobao, WeChat, and Douyin, plays a central role in driving innovation. ""You go to China, all the consumer internet apps, it's not Google or YouTube or Facebook or Instagram, it's the Chinese versions of those. And in fact, they're actually better. They provide a better user experience,"" Tsai said.

According to Tsai, this ""application-rich ecosystem"" pushes companies to adapt quickly, making it an ideal environment for AI deployment. He also spoke about the internal culture at Chinese tech firms, especially among engineers, who often work with a sense of urgency and national competitiveness.

Earlier this year, Alibaba launched its Qwen series of large language models in response to the release of DeepSeek, a rival model. The timing, just before Chinese New Year, didn't stop the company's engineering teams. ""Our engineering leads decided, they said, 'Cancel your Chinese New Year holiday. Everybody. Stay in the company. Sleep in the office. We're going to accelerate our development,'"" Tsai said. ""So within a few weeks, we launched our version.""

Tsai added that Alibaba also open-sourced smaller-parameter versions of its models to contribute to the broader development community.

The conversation shifted to Alibaba's international AI applications, particularly its work with the International Olympic Committee, or IOC. The company has been the IOC's cloud technology provider for the past three Olympic cycles, including the 2024 Paris Olympics.

""One of the areas that we focus on is broadcasting,"" Tsai said, noting that the Olympics generate tens of thousands of hours of footage. ""So what the IOC have done is they centralize the filming of the Games, and they take all that footage, put it onto the cloud."" For the Paris Olympics alone, that meant managing around 11,000 hours of video.

""Last Olympics was the first time cloud technology had overtaken satellite broadcasting technology, and that technology is all supported by Alibaba,"" Tsai said.

Alibaba's AI also played a role in enhancing the viewer experience. ""We actually use our AI to make the game presentation more exciting,"" he said.

The system used AI to generate multi-angle views of action scenes with far fewer cameras than traditional methods. ""It's very compute-intensive, but this is very, very light, very efficient,"" Tsai said.",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202506/13/684b20a7a310a04a967a27bc.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 22:36:03.325047

With this message, Canadian department store chain Hudson’s Bay is closing its doors for good. The company has filed for bankruptcy and is liquidating its assets, resulting in the loss of more than 9,000 jobs. It marks the end of an era for a historic retail institution: Hudson’s Bay opened North America’s first department store and was one of the continent’s oldest continuously operating companies. Here is a look back at the rise and fall of this retail icon.

Hudson’s Bay’s origins trace back to 1670, when two French fur traders— known as coureurs des bois— founded the company with the backing of England’s King Charles II. Pierre- Radisson and Médard Chouart des Groseilliers established several trading posts to collect and ship animal pelts, mainly beaver. According to Quebec newspaper Le Devoir, these operations expanded with little ""consideration for Indigenous populations.""

The company’s influence, driven by its exploitation of local land and maritime resources, soon extended from Canada’s far north to as far south as San Francisco, playing a key role in shaping the economy of the so-called ""New World.""

As the Industrial Revolution and the decline of the fur trade reshaped the market, Hudson’s Bay’s trading posts gradually evolved into retail stores. From the 1880s onward, the company built a nationwide department store network. Over the decades, it acquired several Canadian chains, including Simpsons, Woodward’s and Zellers, while its signature multi-colored stripes became an enduring emblem.

The company briefly ventured into Europe, acquiring Germany’s Galeria Kaufhof in 2015 and taking over the Netherlands’ V&D retail network in 2017. However, facing financial losses, Hudson’s Bay divested its European operations by 2019.

Ninety-six stores affected

In Canada, Hudson’s Bay’s decline began over the past decade. The company operated 80 Hudson’s Bay stores positioned in the upscale segment, along with three Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks OFF 5TH outlets. Business further deteriorated after the pandemic, with the company citing the fast-changing retail landscape and elevated U.S. tariffs as key challenges.

Owned since 2008 by U.S.-based NRDC Equity Partners, the company sought creditor protection in April 2025 under Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), citing difficulties meeting its financial obligations. Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, the company failed to secure funding for a potential restructuring and ultimately moved toward full liquidation.

In recent weeks, stores sold off remaining inventory ahead of a June 1 closing date. The closures led to 8,300 job losses across retail locations, with nearly 1,000 additional layoffs expected in offices and logistics centers by mid-June. Local media reported widespread emotion among longtime employees— some with three decades of service— and among customers who associate Hudson’s Bay with family memories.

However, the brand name, emblems and logos will live on. In mid-May, Canadian retail group Canadian Tire acquired the rights for 30 million Canadian dollars (19 million euros).

A “strategic and patriotic” choice

""It is difficult to witness the final days of another iconic Canadian retailer. While the circumstances are unfortunate, we are proud to step in for customers. This decision is both strategic and patriotic,"" said Canadian Tire president Greg Hicks. The company plans to integrate Hudson’s Bay’s signature stripes into its private label products and has reportedly submitted bids for several store leases.","https://media.fashionnetwork.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover,width=600,height=600,format=auto/m/7639/09c6/f00e/36e3/e71a/993d/2c0a/f76a/eff8/a291/a291.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:20:08.457569

If you’ve been on the internet in recent months, you’ve probably seen an increase in interest in protein-heavy food and drinks.

Now, Starbucks is testing a new way to instantly add a whopping 15 grams of protein to nearly any beverage.

The coffee giant is testing a protein cold foam at five locations in the US through its Starting Five program. It’s part of CEO Brian Niccol’s hopes to expand into the wellness category, the company announced during the Starbucks Leadership Experience in Las Vegas.

“This thing is going to be a rocket,” Niccol said on stage in Las Vegas. “It’s on trend. It’s delicious.”

Niccol explained to Axios that the new innovation is geared toward a number of consumer groups, such as 20-year-old males, 50-year-old females and people taking GLP-1s.

“I was watching people coming to our stores, they would get three shots of espresso over ice,” Niccol explained. “And in some cases, they pull their own protein powder out of their bag, or in other cases, they have a protein drink, like a Fair Life, and they’d pour that into their drink.”

“I’m like, well, wait a second, we can make this experience better for them,” he added.

There’s currently a huge push for protein with Gen Z, with different recipes and trends such as the “100 grams of protein daily” challenge going viral on TikTok.

And with the continuous rise of GLP-1 drugs, research has shown that a high-protein diet is vital to maintaining muscle with the appetite-suppressing injectable treatments.

“The good news is now I think we’re right on trend, and we can do it, I think, arguably better than anybody else,” Niccol said.

According to Fast Company, the protein cold foam will be identical to the cold foam Starbucks customers know and love — but it will be packed with somewhere between 15 and 18 grams of protein.

The world’s largest coffee chain reportedly initially imagined that the protein blend would simply mix into drinks, but it kept getting clumpy — something that protein powder consumers may know a thing or two about — and they wanted to solve that problem.

The development team found that blending the powder into foam got rid of the clumps, which led to the protein cold foam innovation.

Starbucks shared that their protein powder should be able to be added to any of its cold foam flavors, but the current testing version is a banana cold foam, FoodSided reported. They’re starting the testing with Starbucks’ Iced Caffe Latte.

While it’s being tested in just five locations at the moment, Niccol told Axios he thinks the nationwide release of the protein cold foam will be sooner rather than later.

“It’s not one of those things that’s years away. It’s months away,” he said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/logo-american-coffee-company-starbucks-106259543.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-06-12 22:37:57.742355

The usage of the federal government’s Employment Insurance (EI) work-sharing program has increased by approximately 75% since November 2024.

According to government data shared with Bloomberg News, more than 790 arrangements were active as of June 8. Employers in Ontario and Quebec make up nearly 90% of the current arrangements.

“Obviously, the program in a way camouflages the current economic uncertainty, but it is necessary,” Samuel Poulin, parliamentary assistant to Quebec’s economy minister, said in an interview.

Starbucks has confirmed to TODAY.com that it is testing a banana protein cold foam on an iced latte, joining the ever-expanding list of brands offering high-protein options. The brand revealed the innovation at the Starbucks Leadership Experience event in Las Vegas this week.

Starbucks is light on specifics about the new banana-flavored foam, but, according to Fast Company, it’s loaded with somewhere between 15 and 18 grams of protein and will also be available in other flavors like chocolate in the future.

The protein-packed cold foam is being tested in five Starbucks stores, but the brand declined to specify which locations or when it would begin appearing on menus.

This move is part of the brand’s back-to-Starbucks strategy, which involves reimagining and modernizing its food and beverages to build a buzzier menu.

Starbucks says it’s taking a “new, deliberate approach” to testing menu innovations through a program it calls Starting Five with select coffeehouses in the U.S. Confirmed tests include protein in coffee, freshly-baked croissants and a new item called the Strato Frappuccino, which offers a more layered drink experience.

Starbucks is following in the footsteps of other protein-maxxing companies who have been adding the macronutrient to ice cream, candy bars, lemonade, water and, most recently, Khloe Kardashian’s popcorn.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Starbucks-Cold-Foams-te-250612-98ab96.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:38:03.090473

Company Announcement

Customers are being asked to remove the affected devices from use and replace with an alternate means of ventilation

June 11, 2025 — In May 2025, Medtronic issued a voluntary recall notification to global customers related to specific Newport™ HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators and certain related Newport™ service parts. The FDA recently designated this voluntary action by Medtronic as a Class I recall.

With this recall, Medtronic is advising discontinuation of clinical use of the affected devices. Investigation into customer complaints identified two separate capacitors on one of the ventilator’s controller Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA), that, in case of failure, may result in:

The ventilator shutting down during use, or

The shutdown alert alarm failing to sound effectively.

The following table identifies the item name, manufacture date and use by date:

No instances of both capacitors failing on the same PCBA board have occurred, nor are they anticipated to occur.

If a ventilator fails and does not provide adequate ventilation, the patient may not be able to breathe on their own, leading to low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide levels, and potentially severe consequences like brain injury or death. There have been 63 medical device reports (MDRs) associated with this issue, including two serious injuries and one death. HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators are intended for use by home users, as well as for infant and pediatric patients who may be at higher risks of injury or death due to unanticipated ventilator failures.

Customer recommendations

Customers should remove the affected devices from use and replace with an alternate means of ventilation. Medtronic is not correcting these issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service affected ventilators identified in this notification. Customers with questions should contact Medtronic Customer Service at 800-962-9888. Adverse events or product quality concerns with this product should be reported to the FDA and Medtronic:

Refer to the customer notification and the patient letter for additional information.

The Newport™ HT70 family of ventilators is intended to provide continuous or intermittent positive pressure mechanical ventilatory support for individuals who require mechanical ventilation through invasive or noninvasive interfaces. Specifically, the Newport™ HT70 family of ventilators is applicable for infant, pediatric, and adult patients greater than or equal to 5 kg (11 lbs) in hospital, sub-acute, emergency department, and home care environments as well as for transport and emergency response applications. The Newport™ HT70 operator’s manual can be found here.

Medtronic will continue working directly with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies around the world on this voluntary recall. In February 2024, Medtronic announced its decision to exit its ventilator product lines, including the Newport™ ventilators. The company continues to serve the needs of its customers and their patients worldwide, and honor existing ventilator contracts, as they wind down the business over the coming years.

Dominant market share

Despite a decline in overall market performance, the family-owned company has achieved notable growth, solidifying its significant market share of 43.3% as of the first quarter of 2025. This figure surpasses the combined market share of all its competitors, further cementing the company’s leadership in this space.

Jörg Pfirrmann, managing director of Rügenwalder Mühle, attributed the company’s success to its innovation-driven approach and strong brand leadership. “We are growing profitably and have gained new market shares through innovations and clear brand leadership – against the industry trend,” he stated.

Outperforming a downward market

While the plant-based sector as a whole experienced a six percent downturn in the first quarter of 2025, Rügenwalder Mühle expanded by almost four percent during the same period. In contrast, many private label brands and other competitors faced declines.

One of the key drivers of this growth is Rügenwalder Mühle’s focus on product innovation. The company has consistently launched new items, with six of its products ranking among the 13 most successful of 2024. Notably, its Vegan Hauchgenuss Classic – Chicken Style topped the list as the most successful product of the year.

“Nearly half of the most successful products in 2024 come from us. We occupy the top three spots. This shows that we are setting standards in the veggie market – not with a large quantity of products, but with quality, taste, and relevance for our consumers,” said Pfirrmann.

Despite fluctuating market conditions, the demand for plant-based alternatives continues to rise, reflecting broader societal shifts. Rügenwalder Mühle remains confident in the future growth of the sector. “We are convinced that a double-digit market share in Germany is realistic – especially since young, sustainability-minded consumers will become the family shoppers of tomorrow,” Pfirrmann remarked. He furthered that the key to maintaining long-term success is delivering products that meet both taste and sustainability expectations.

Leading plant-based innovation in Germany

The company’s leadership in innovation is also supported by external market research. According to NIQ, Rügenwalder Mühle is among the top three innovation drivers in the meat and dairy alternatives segment. Enrico Krien, Director of Customer Success DACH at Nielsen, noted, “Rügenwalder Mühle is one of the leading innovation drivers in the field of meat and dairy alternatives.”

Consumer perception aligns with these findings. Rügenwalder Mühle referenced a study conducted by Kantar, a market research institute, which revealed that Rügenwalder Mühle outperformed other brands across multiple categories, including perceived innovation, product uniqueness, and its reputation as a trendsetter.

Pfirrmann concluded, “Even in the eyes of consumers, we are the clear innovation leader. Our brand is perceived as a trendsetter, with a unique offering and strong emotional connection. This means we are not only in shopping baskets but also in the minds and hearts of people.”",https://assets.vegconom.de/media/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/12123137/Rugenwalder-Muhle-4.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:29:15.251079

LOS ANGELES, CA — Some 45,000 workers at Southern California's busiest grocery stores are ready to walk off the job after the union representing Albertsons, Pavilions, Ralphs and Vons employees announced this week its members had authorized a strike.

""Our message is clear: we are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve,"" reads a statement from the Bargaining Committee of Locals 324 and 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers. ""For four months, we've negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions, and customer service.

""The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were 'anecdotal,' downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily.""

The unions cover workers at grocery stores owned by Kroger and Albertsons in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, a Local 770 representative told Patch.

The union said 90% of its membership voted to authorize the strike in an election that was scheduled amid stalled contract negotiations between the labor groups and the grocery giants, the Orange County register reported.

Members of Local 770 planned to gather in Los Angeles' Koreatown Thursday to make signs and hold picket captain meetings in advance of a possible strike. The union is part of a coalition of regional grocery store labor groups that make up Grocery Workers Rising.

Grocery Workers Rising is planning a week of ""practice strikes"" beginning Monday across LA County and will hold a rally in Long Beach on June 20.

It's unclear when customers could expect a strike to begin in Southern California; the authorization vote doesn't mean a work stoppage is guaranteed.

But it's a real possibility: The SoCal labor dispute is one of many unfolding concurrently across the country — tens of thousands of additional grocery store workers are ready to strike against Kroger and Albertsons after other recent authorization votes.

In Colorado, strikes could happen as soon as Sunday, according to reports from the state.

""We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers and allows our company to remain competitive,"" Albertsons, which is also the parent company of Pavilions and Vons, said in a statement.

A Ralphs spokesperson said in a statement: ""We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption. Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading health care and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.

""We remain committed to good faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.""

The same group of SoCal grocery workers went on strike or were locked out in 2003 as part of an action that lasted for over four months in what was the longest and largest supermarket strike in U.S. history. Consumers who crossed the picket lines found half-empty shelves as they did their Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping at Albertsons and Ralphs. The dispute led the chains to lose a combined $1.5 billion in sales, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Negotiations in SoCal are scheduled to resume on June 25, according to the union. The workers' contracts expired March 2.

The union said it is seeking ""living wages, affordable healthcare benefits, a reliable pension (and) more staffing and better working conditions for a better customer experience.""

A strike authorization vote does not necessarily mean there will be a strike.

Union members approved a three-year contract in 2022 after a threatened strike, including wage increases of $4.25 per hour for most workers while some classifications received higher pay raises.

Tariffs implemented by the Trump administration during Q1 had a significant financial impact on HP, executives said during the earnings call.
The levies led to reduced non-GAAP earnings and operating profit, as well as a dip in operating margin for PCs.
""Personal Systems operating margin came in below our guidance largely due to higher tariffs that were not fully offset by our actions in the quarter,"" Lores said.
""We expect to successfully mitigate this cost and return to our long-term target range of 5% to 7% next quarter.""","Dive Brief:

HP sped up plans to shift manufacturing of North America-bound PCs and printers outside of China to offset higher-than-expected tariffs, President and CEO Enrique Lores said in a May 28 earnings call.

The computer maker increased production in India, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam and the U.S. and expects to bypass China for nearly all U.S. imports by the end of June, Lores said.

""In Q2, we acted quickly to address tariff-related headwinds, taking decisive steps like accelerating our manufacturing rebalancing, redesigning our logistics network, shifting sourcing and qualifying new product configurations,"" the CEO said.

Dive Insight:

In Q1 2025, Lores set September as the target date for having less than 10% of HP’s products sold in North America made in China. The Trump administration’s April tariffs triggered a significant acceleration of the plan.

“While we plan for a range of scenarios in the quarter and we worked aggressively to respond to changes in the regulatory trade environment, the tariff increases announced in April were higher than expected,” CFO Karen Parkhill said on the earnings call.

HP adjusted its logistics networks and supply chain during the quarter, per Lores. For example, the company avoided tariffs in Canada and Latin America by removing the U.S. as a distribution hub.

HP's strategy for offsetting tariffs also included raising prices on PCs and printers, which it saw other market participants and competitors doing as well, Lores said.

While Uganda currently lacks in-country glass recycling capacity, the 63 metric tons of glass collected during the initiative were transported to Tanzania.
Following the pilot’s success, NBL intends to scale up the glass collection initiative, expand to new regions, and roll out consumer awareness campaigns to promote recycling behaviour.
“Though Uganda doesn’t yet have domestic glass recycling, this pilot proves the potential.
Together with startups like Yo-Waste, we’re helping to build a more sustainable Uganda.","Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | To commemorate World Environment Day, Nile Breweries Limited (NBL) has announced the successful completion of a glass bottle recycling pilot, implemented in partnership with local tech startup Yo-Waste under the AB InBev 100+ Accelerator Program, it said in a statement shared on June 11.

The pilot, which ran from August 2024 to March 2025, focused on collecting, sorting, and preparing post-consumer glass waste for recycling. While Uganda currently lacks in-country glass recycling capacity, the 63 metric tons of glass collected during the initiative were transported to Tanzania. There, the glass was processed into cullet and reintegrated into AB InBev’s bottle manufacturing supply chain, creating a closed-loop system that reduces environmental impact.

“This initiative shows that circular solutions are still achievable even with limited infrastructure,” said Emmanuel Njuki, Legal & Corporate Affairs Lead at NBL. We exceeded our initial target of 50 metric tons, collecting 63 metric tons of glass through partnerships with 15 outlets across Kampala and surrounding areas, enabled by a tech- driven collection process using the Yo-Waste mobile app.”

“As the world transitions to more sustainable production models, NBL is proud to lead this shift in Uganda,” Njuki added. “This pilot proves that with local innovation and strong partnerships, we can build a circular packaging system that benefits businesses, communities, and the planet.”

Nile Breweries has long prioritized sustainable packaging. Over 90% of our products are sold in returnable packaging, significantly reducing single-use materials. Our breweries have implemented robust waste segregation systems at source.

Our breweries are on a path of increasing our already high recycling rate and eliminating onsite waste generation through reducing resource use, recycling and reusing materials where possible. So far, our average recycling rate for Jinja and Mbarara breweries stands at above 90%.

Following the pilot’s success, NBL intends to scale up the glass collection initiative, expand to new regions, and roll out consumer awareness campaigns to promote recycling behaviour. “Though Uganda doesn’t yet have domestic glass recycling, this pilot proves the potential. Together with startups like Yo-Waste, we’re helping to build a more sustainable Uganda. Every bottle returned is a step toward a greener future,” said Emmanuel.

This initiative proves the potential of sustainable packaging solutions and aligns with AB InBev’s global sustainability ambition to have 100% of its products in returnable packaging or packaging made from a majority of recycled content.",https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EmmanuelNjuki-and-Martin-Tumusiime.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:14:09.023334

A committee of House members and senators on Wednesday amended a bill that initially set rules for how pharmacists could work remotely.

House members voted 88-4 to approve the conference committee's compromise, but the Senate didn't hold a final vote — killing the matter for now.","BATON ROUGE — The debate over a bill pitting mom-and-pop drug stories against pharmacy benefit managers lasted until the final day of the 2025 legislative session, and drew the state’s attorney general into a battle with a major national chain.

A committee of House members and senators on Wednesday amended a bill that initially set rules for how pharmacists could work remotely. After the change, the proposal said any company affiliated with a pharmacy benefits manager couldn’t hold a permit to operate a drug store in the state.

""Your local pharmacist is the most accessible health professional to the community. Most of the time, you can get to your pharmacist before you can get to a doctor,"" said Kyle Talley, a former pharmacy technician at Floyd’s Family Pharmacy near Ponchatoula.

PBMs are middlemen among pharmaceutical companies, businesses, health insurance companies and workers. Critics say PBMs drive up the costs of medicine to ensure everyone affiliated with the plan makes money, but PBMs often say their scale allows them to negotiate lower prices, especially for commonly used drugs.

After the House and Senate conference committee amended the pharmacist bill Wednesday, CVS tapped its customer network via text and urged them to lobby against the proposal. The company said it would have to close more than 100 stores, impacting 980,000 customers, if the bill passed.

House members voted 88-4 to approve the conference committee's compromise, but the Senate didn't hold a final vote — killing the matter for now.

Attorney General Liz Murrill said CVS misused its customer list and said she was preparing a cease-and-desist order against it, despite concerns it would violate the company’s constitutional rights.

“CVS did not obtain people’s personal cell phone numbers for the purpose of using it to lobby against legislation,” Murrill said in a news conference. “If you’ve every given permission to them to use your phone number, you gave it to them for particular things, like getting a notice about a vaccine that might be available to you.

“Those are the kinds of reasons why they have your phone number, not so they can use it to lobby against legislation that hurts them,” she said.

The bill concerned last-minute language that Louisiana should deny a state permit to any pharmacy ""wholly or partially owned or controlled"" by a pharmacy benefit manager or one of its subsidiaries.

CVS said quick action was needed after the 11th-hour change to the bill.

""We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy and acted accordingly,"" spokeswoman Amy Thibault said. ""Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.""

Non-CVS customers received notices Wednesday, as well, asking them to contact lawmakers.

Many pharmacies, regardless of whether they are affiliated with a PBM, maintain contact information for their customers, often to send them reminders about when prescription refills are ready or vaccinations are due.

Randal Johnson of the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association said benefits managers have an outsized role in the drug industry.

“The PBM is truly supposed to be a claims processor in the middle,” he said.

Instead, Talley said, independent companies are forced to accept whatever deal they can make, “knowing that it’s going to have a negative impact on our bottom line.”

“The PMS are underpaying us so bad to where you’re in a financial position where you can’t even buy the inventory that you need,” Talley said.

Murrill said that, without the legislation, rural communities could lose their drug stores as large chains undercut them on prices.

“The independent pharmacists in our communities around the state play an enormously important role,” she said, warning of “pharmaceutical-pharmacy health care deserts.”",https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/oIpIceOEO7BBHduvoxH5fQNcJuJjQo_lEAo81thqa_kvr8VGkf54lf_XijJSK39jnJNQQOqZSNgJp7KVNi7PpqgLx9_7DIhYp66QqX_JKjf83iuW7-jf_vTpl6iHxAqL0,N,,2025-06-12 22:23:40.877493

Magazine,Kit Eaton,,,,,https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/why-starbucks-is-bucking-the-trend-and-hiring-more-managers/91201543,"The ASM role makes sense as the company addresses its in-store operations.
They’ll “help provide consistent leadership support throughout more of the store’s operating hours,” allowing store managers, who “typically oversee multimillion-dollar businesses and lead teams of around 18 partners,” to tackle more strategic tasks.
But from a managerial viewpoint, formalizing the assistant store manager role makes sense.
This frees up higher-ranking officers from having to worry about day-to-day matters so they’re free to strategize.
Starbucks is doing almost exactly the same thing, in hopes that by freeing up store managers’ time, they’ll be able to lead their stores better and come up with ways to improve profits.","In a blog post announcing the changes, Starbucks explained that only about 20 percent of its stores have an assistant manager right now, and that person’s role “tends to be short-term and varies by location.” That’s all going to change, with the ASM becoming a full-time role in most stores, with each manager reporting directly to the store manager (or “coffeehouse leader” in Starbucks-speak). The ASM role makes sense as the company addresses its in-store operations. They’ll “help provide consistent leadership support throughout more of the store’s operating hours,” allowing store managers, who “typically oversee multimillion-dollar businesses and lead teams of around 18 partners,” to tackle more strategic tasks. This includes “developing talent, creating the Starbucks Experience, and building community.” The idea is to enable store managers to do more than merely “react to the day-to-day.”

The company’s also spinning it as a good move for existing staff members, suggesting that for interested workers it could be a “meaningful first step into coffeehouse leadership.” It also aligns with the company’s goal of hiring 90 percent of its retail leadership roles from inside its own ranks. The blog also underlines how important Starbucks views its workers, pointing out it provides equity, 100 percent tuition coverage for a first bachelor’s degree, up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave, and more.

This pro-worker terminology stands in bold contrast to some of the company’s recent changes to its uniform policy, which riled up store baristas to the point some went on strike. A previous round of strikes affected over 300 stores nationwide on Christmas Eve last year, when members of a workers union took action over unresolved issues relating to wages, staffing, and schedules.

What’s more interesting about the new ASM changes are that they come as other big brands, like Amazon and Meta, are taking steps to cull middle-rank managers and workers in an effort to streamline business processes and improve profitability. But from a managerial viewpoint, formalizing the assistant store manager role makes sense.

Think of it as a parallel to the way an army works: Sergeants are the midlevel, noncommissioned officers who work directly with troops and military materiel and act efficiently to “get stuff done” in response to their commanders’ orders. This frees up higher-ranking officers from having to worry about day-to-day matters so they’re free to strategize. Starbucks is doing almost exactly the same thing, in hopes that by freeing up store managers’ time, they’ll be able to lead their stores better and come up with ways to improve profits.

Starbucks’s move also stands out in an AI-centric era. Other companies are attempting similar efficiency and productivity boosts by using AI to free up staff members’ time—Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been very clear this is his goal when he recently announced a plan to ditch some midlevel coders at his company.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/06/starbucks-asst-managers-inc-GettyImages-1806571763.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:38:45.083684

House Bill 358, which stirred ferocious debate in the waning hours of the legislative session but did not pass, would have barred companies from owning both pharmacy benefits managers and drug stores. Supporters said that would have stopped big companies from squeezing independent pharmacies out of the market and keeping too much of the savings they get on prescription drugs.

PBMs are meant to act as middlemen between pharmacies, health care plans and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug costs.

CVS, which owns both the drug store chain and a PBM, Caremark, said the bill would have forced them to close 119 pharmacies in Louisiana. The company launched a lobbying blitz on Wednesday that included a mass text message campaign telling customers the bill could force their drugstore to close and asking them to contact their legislator.

The text messages infuriated many lawmakers, who accused the company of scare tactics.

In a note distributed to legislators on the floor Thursday, Murrill pointed out that CVS manages the drug plans for state employees through the Office of Group Benefits.

“My office will be investigating whether CVS improperly appropriated to its own use the personal information of OGB members and will take legal action if it did,” the note said. “This is not an appropriate use of personal information obtained through a state contract.”

In a press conference Thursday afternoon, though, Murrill said she was her investigation was ""broader than just the OGB contract."" She said she would examine whether CVS engaged in ""unfair and deceptive trade practices by improperly using people's personal information in a way that they did not permit.""

Murrill announced on X that she was sending CVS a cease-and-desist letter and civil investigative demands.

Gov. Jeff Landry also spoke out against CVS’ lobbying action in a post on X,

“Abusing patients’ sensitive information to push a political message is completely unethical and manipulative and we will not stand for it,” the post said.

Amy Thibault, a CVS spokesperson, issued a statement saying the company's communications with its customers, patients and community members were ""consistent with the law.""

""This bill came together yesterday with no public hearing,"" Thibault said. ""We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly.""

Thibault referred to the fact that the PBM legislation came through an amendment to a bill that originally set rules for remote work for pharmacy technicians.

That amendment was proposed while the bill was in a conference committee, a closed-door process where a group of House and Senate members meet to hash out agreements on bills when one chamber has rejected the other's amendments.

Lawmakers on Thursday expressed consternation at the idea that CVS had used customer information to send out lobbying texts. State Rep. Beryl Amedée, R-Gray, saying she found it “disturbing.”

“I’m going to assume that somewhere in the tremendous amount of fine print that comes when you sign up for anything these days, that they have covered their potential liability here, but I still think that’s outside the boundaries of what customers expected when they gave their phone numbers to get prescription updates,” she said. “I’m very disappointed in CVS because the messaging that they did send out was untrue and I consider it propaganda.”

Lawmakers shared screenshots of texts that CVS sent to constituents.

One said HB358 would “prohibit CVS Specialty from serving you and thousands of other patients who receive specialty prescription drugs.”

“You will lose access to your pharmacy team, pharmacy supportive services, and you will need to be serviced by an alternate specialty pharmacy provider,” it said.

The text included a link for customers to send messages to their elected officials.

“I’ve been getting comments from my constituents and friends, and they’re terrified, and it ain’t right,” said state Rep. Michael Bayham, R-Chalmette.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/93/19377d49-496b-586a-93bc-311730a4c8ce/66fc586d218bd.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-12 22:23:49.643470

The next-generation Redefine Burger and Redefine Beef Mince are set to hit retail shelves across the Netherlands, Germany, and France. These products feature significant improvements, including a reduction in saturated fats by up to 90% and a protein content ranging from 11 to 16 grams per 100 grams.

Delivering a “meatier” experience

The newly released products were developed in collaboration with chefs, meat experts, and consumers to ensure both flavor and texture meet consumer expectations for a more authentic meat experience. Extensive sensory testing, which involved both vegan and non-vegan participants, informed the final formulations of the burgers and mince. The company claims that the products now deliver a “meatier” experience compared to previous versions.

Eshchar Ben-Shitrit, CEO and co-founder of Redefine Meat, noted that taste remains a key factor for consumers, particularly those who are flexitarian or regular meat eaters. “Our unique taste-first approach is at the heart of all product development. While many other plant-based products continue to fall short in this area, our next-generation products build upon our premium-quality legacy to deliver an even meatier taste,” he stated.

In addition to improved taste and texture, the nutritional composition of the new products has been optimized to meet the highest Nutri-Score rating (A). Key updates include a significant reduction in methylcellulose content, which has been lowered to less than 2%, as well as an overall increase in protein content.

Tech capabilities allow for rapid prototyping

The company’s technological capabilities, including its patented additive manufacturing processes and the use of AI and machine learning to optimize meat-like qualities, allow for faster prototyping and iteration. This provides Redefine Meat with an edge over traditional plant-based meat production processes, enabling quicker responses to consumer preferences.

Redefine Meat’s new products will be available in major retailers, including Jumbo, Picnic, Plus, and Vomar in the Netherlands; Tegut in Germany; and Monoprix in France.

Ben-Shitrit also addressed consumer concerns about nutrition in plant-based foods, stating, “We recognize that nutrition is playing an increasingly important role in consumer buying habits. Our next-generation products deliver high levels of protein, vitamins, and fiber, without cholesterol, offering a better alternative to many other processed foods.”",https://assets.vegconom.de/media/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/12114044/RT_BBQ-season_Burger-760x507-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:29:20.175801

Dive Brief:

Nescafé sourced 32% of its coffee from farmers that implemented regenerative agriculture practices last year, surpassing a 2025 goal of sourcing 20% of coffee from such methods, parent company Nestlé announced Wednesday.

The instant coffee brand — the largest from the Swiss food and beverage giant — launched a program in 2022 to help farmers transition to sustainable practices that improve productivity, cut spending and reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to coffee production. Farmers that adopted this “Nescafé Plan 2030” achieved an emissions reduction between 20% to 40% per kilogram of unroasted coffee beans last year, per the company.

Nescafé counts the progress towards its goal of lowering its overall carbon footprint and sourcing half of its coffee from farmers that incorporate regenerative agriculture practices.

Dive Insight:

Nescafé said its program encourages farmers to adopt regenerative agriculture practices. These include optimizing fertilization, which improves quality and soil health, in addition to reduced carbon dioxide; planting cover crops, that help in improving biodiversity, soil health and reducing dependency on agrochemicals; and land restoration, which helps them plant native trees to capture carbon dioxide in and near the coffee farms and improves biodiversity and water management.

The program focuses on improving the livelihoods of the sourcing farmers and the communities they live in and includes social initiatives like human rights and child protection. The coffee brand said the latter services include monitoring and bettering children and workers’ rights across Nescafé’s supply chains.

Coffee is one of the world’s most traded agricultural commodities, but a recent analysis by the Carbon Disclosure Project found that the amount of land suitable for coffee cultivation and production could reduce by 48% to 97% by 2050 in key regions due to climate change. The study said most of coffee’s carbon footprint — 75% to 91% — is generated before the coffee beans even leave the farm. Key factors contributing to the generated emissions come from land use, deforestation, fertilizer and processing methods. Hence, incorporating regenerative agriculture practices is more important than ever.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/DJBrA3usWXy6MnCrv0dYg77wVAsQebjOpLRz4Cjmb-g/g:nowe:651:414/c:4984:2816/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05NTU2NDc5OTQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-12 22:23:55.356486

Mattel, the toy giant behind Barbie and Hot Wheels, has struck a deal with OpenAI to help design and develop toys using the startup’s technology, signaling a new era of AI-assisted play tied to its billion-dollar brands.

“Mr. Hill will be tasked with executing these changes and winning back market share lost to competitors that filled shelves left by Nike’s vacancy,” S&P Global Ratings’ analyst Amanda O’Neill said in emailed comments in September. “Specifically, Nike has lost its footing in the specialty running category, specifically losing market share to newer entrants Hoka and OnRunning, and legacy competitors Adidas and New Balance have retained their positions in the lifestyle category.”

Hill, who retired from Nike in 2020 after a lengthy 32-year tenure with the activewear giant, isn’t shying away from change during his second Nike stint, especially when it comes to the executive leadership team.

In early October, just before Hill took over, Nike featured 12 executives on its leadership page, including then-CEO John Donahoe and Hill, alongside Chairman Emeritus Phil Knight and Executive Chairman Mark Parker. Now, eight months later, just three executives remain in their same role, excluding Knight, Parker and Hill. The leadership team has grown to 14 executives, the majority of which are either new to their title or top-line leadership role at Nike. The page as it stands is reflective of Hill’s direct leadership team, though other notable appointments have also been made across the organization, a spokesperson said.

In all the hubbub, four executives with 26-plus years of experience have announced their retirements since Hill joined, including marketing lead John Slusher, Chief Human Resources Officer Monique Matheson, Chief Innovation Officer John Hoke and President of Consumer, Product and Brand Heidi O’Neill. But even with those departures, the team Hill is building remains largely Nike-centric.

Everyone on Nike’s leadership page currently is a Nike veteran; in fact, the only notable appointment Hill has made externally is for the brand’s new chief communications officer. Michael Gonda arrives in early July from McDonald’s and his only other experience at a major brand is at yogurt maker Chobani.

Other than Gonda, much of the team Hill has assembled has decades of experience at Nike — something analysts flagged as a bonus when Hill was named to the top spot last fall.

“While fundamentals will be very challenged in the near-term, we believe that it takes a back seat to the narrative, which is that of a veteran athlete coming out of retirement to pull his once-proud team out of the dumps,” Needham analyst Tom Nikic wrote in December, after Hill’s first earnings call as CEO.

Additionally, Hill’s adjustments so far highlight a few structural changes in the way Nike is doing business. For example, the chief executive elevated Chief Supply Chain Officer Venkatesh Alagirisamy to the senior leadership team in October and in May separated O’Neill’s responsibilities for consumer, product and brand into three distinct roles that will all report to Hill individually.

Nike has new marketing and communications leads, and three different C-level roles that arguably all handle innovation: a chief innovation officer, a chief growth initiatives officer and a chief innovation, design and product officer.

These notably reflect some of Nike’s top turnaround priorities: product innovation and brand storytelling.

Likewise, Nike is tackling its DTC-wholesale mix with new leadership. Hill in March said he worked with Craig Williams, who leads Nike’s geographies and marketplace, to institute new leaders for Nike Direct and Nike Wholesale. Shannon Glass was named vice president of Nike Direct in January, per her LinkedIn, while Erica Bullard serves as her counterpart on wholesale.

Hill described them both as “long-term industry veterans and Nike veterans” and said he’s tasked them with working closely together after Nike’s previous DTC-wholesale missteps led to some of the challenges it’s currently facing.

“In fact, we even put them sitting … up on our floor together. They have offices right outside of one another,” Hill said on the earnings call in March. “I told them those two have got to walk together everywhere they go and make certain that we stay aligned. And I think they're doing a tremendous job of really making certain that we have an integrated approach to the overall marketplace.”

Saying is one thing, but doing is another — and the Nike turnaround will likely take time, GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments in September.

“Nike has a long road to travel in order to compete more successfully against younger, nimbler brands. And its reinvention coincides with a period of soft sneaker demand,” Saunders said. “Hill likely has the skill and vision to turn the business around, but this will not happen overnight. A change of jockey does not automatically put the Nike horse out in front.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/e1d7ROyXWAnk2Fd3n4_DMWbGvahQEYHR7an1z0NFbJU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yNDA5MTdfRWxsaW90dEhpbGxfT3JpZ2luYWwuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-12 22:33:33.145769

HP Dimension with Google Beam comes with six cameras and an AI that creates 3D videos of each participant. The system uses a 65-inch light-field display to give a realistic sense of size, depth, and color, even making eye contact appear natural, as reported by our colleagues at ZDNet.

The experience does not require any headsets, glasses, or wearables. The only hardware needed is the Google Beam solution, and the pricing starts at $24,999. Yep.

The system is to have compatibility with popular video meeting platforms, so it will have a native experience for Zoom Rooms and Google Meet. It also supports 3D one-on-one calls and traditional 2D group meetings and works with cloud-based video services such as Teams and Webex.

HP says the product addresses a workplace need, as 73% of knowledge workers say they want to feel more connected to coworkers. Internal testing by HP shows that using Dimension with Google Beam led to a 28% increase in memory recall, 29% more non-verbal behaviors, and at least a 14% increase in focus on the meeting partner.

HP Dimension will be available to select customers in late 2025. The company says the product is meant for shared enterprise use.",https://i.extremetech.com/imagery/content-types/078ShgIouLGhE5y6ukldrCU/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.webp,N,,2025-06-12 22:26:59.030088

Green Dot Assist even troubleshoots hardware issues.
Packaged in an iPad app (apparently, Microsoft couldn’t convince the coffee chain to use Surface devices), Green Dot Assist combines training, support, and efficiency tools, all powered by Azure’s generative AI capabilities.
Given Starbucks’ longstanding emphasis on employee training, an AI-powered employee training guide and assistant makes sense.","While most companies across the food value chain are embracing AI in some form, one major player that’s been notably quiet is Starbucks.

From mobile ordering to Web3 experiments, and computer vision-powered bioauthentication to automated drink-making, the Seattle-based coffee giant has never shied away from tooting its own hard about tech-forward initiatives. But when it came to generative AI, the most hyped tech trend of the past few years, Starbucks had kept relatively quiet, leaving many to wonder what it was working on and when it might reveal its plans.

That wait is over. This week, at a 14,000-employee conference in Las Vegas, the company unveiled Green Dot Assist, a generative AI-powered assistant designed to help baristas and store managers streamline their operations.

So, what is Green Dot Assist? In short, it’s a Microsoft Azure-powered virtual assistant currently being piloted in 35 Starbucks locations. The app assists with a range of tasks, from training new employees on how to prepare specific beverages to supporting shift managers with dynamic scheduling in response to real-time changes, such as last-minute call-outs.

Green Dot Assist even troubleshoots hardware issues. In a demo video shared by Starbucks, a barista named Dave uses the assistant to diagnose an espresso machine that’s pulling inconsistent shots. The AI provides 3D visual guides and prompts Dave to submit a service ticket—an experience that blends visual diagnostics with conversational support.

Packaged in an iPad app (apparently, Microsoft couldn’t convince the coffee chain to use Surface devices), Green Dot Assist combines training, support, and efficiency tools, all powered by Azure’s generative AI capabilities.

Given Starbucks’ longstanding emphasis on employee training, an AI-powered employee training guide and assistant makes sense. But my guess is this is just the beginning. In the longer term, I expect Starbucks to leverage AI to further enhance operational efficiency, particularly given the significant shift in order mix towards mobile ordering, which has led to increased wait times and customer frustration. This next wave will likely include more advanced automation, as we’ve already started to see with the chain’s push to roll out its Clover Vertica machine nationwide this year and – possible – a new point of sale system announced this week at the company’s employee conference.",https://i0.wp.com/thespoon.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-12-at-9.09.09-AM.png?fit=1200%2C704&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-12 22:39:22.905375

The letter advised customers of a potential power supply failure in a specific set of Hugo consoles. Medtronic received 25 complaints related to the loss of power due to failures of the surgeon console main power supply. The main power supply provides power to the entire console except for the 3D monitor, which has its own power supply.

Power supply failure could lead to the permanent loss of ability to teleoperate the system from the surgeon console before or during the procedure. During this failure, the tower and arm cart assembly remain operable. This enables the manual manipulation of arms and/or the removal of instruments and the endoscope, if needed.

Of the 25 complaints investigated, Medtronic reports zero instances of serious patient harm. Six complaints reported non-serious injury. Five of those related to conversions to laparoscopy and one required conversion to another robotic system. Of these cases, two reported an extended procedural time greater than 30 minutes. The remaining 19 complaints reported no injury.

Medtronic says the potential for harm includes treatment delay, bleeding, tissue damage and/or tissue trauma. Its notice has no impact on patients who have already undergone a procedure using the Hugo system.

According to Medtronic, continued use of Hugo is considered appropriate based on an internal review. Company representatives intend to inspect impacted systems and service devices within the coming months.

More about the Medtronic Hugo surgical robot

Hugo is a modular, multi-quadrant platform designed for various surgical procedures. It features wristed instruments, 3D visualization and surgical video capture options in Touch Surgery Enterprise. Hugo combines with Touch Surgery Enterprise to offer a smart, digitally enabled surgical experience.

Medtronic first unveiled Hugo in September 2019 as a potential competitor to long-time industry leader Intuitive Surgical.

Hugo received CE mark approval for urologic and gynecologic procedures in October 2021 and a launch began with the first procedure in Europe in February 2022. However, the system remains investigational in the U.S., but perhaps not for long — the company submitted Hugo to the FDA this year.

Additionally, Medtronic hopes to add more clinical studies earlier this year. It seeks to expand Hugo’s indications to hernia and gynecology.

Sam's Club recently surveyed its members and found that 72% are ""actively seeking minimally processed foods.""
Sam's Club has already rolled out cookies and snacks without artificial colors.
""And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step.","A MAJOR bill that has just passed forces Sam's Club to overhaul all of its home brand items by the end of the year.

The retailer is being forced to get in line with legislation spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr about toxic chemicals.

The Walmart-owned Sam's Club is launching its initiative called ""Made Without"", which looks to eliminate over 40 ingredients from the private label brand Member's Mark.

The removals have been seen across 96% of the Member's Mark items.

The ingredients being removed from items include things like artificial colors and aspartame, a sweetener that is roughly 200 times wetter than sugar.

One of the other reasons is thought to be the changing health preferences of the younger generations, who are becoming more conscious about what they eat.

Sam's Club recently surveyed its members and found that 72% are ""actively seeking minimally processed foods.""

While 90% said that they ""either live or aspire to live a healthier lifestyle.""

Many food companies are working on their existing products and introducing new ones without these artificial dyes.

Sam's Club has already rolled out cookies and snacks without artificial colors.

The retailer had already pledged to remove them in a 2022 press release.

Sam's Club Chief Merchant Julie Barber said then: ""We take pride in the high-quality ingredients that go into our products, but what truly differentiates us are the ingredients we consciously leave out.""

Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of private brands, added: ""The Sam's Club member is at the center of everything we do, so as we continue to evolve the Member's Mark brand, we intend to develop items that are reflective of the ingredients, processes, and materials they want – and don't want – in their products.""

HEALTH PUSH

It comes as Kennedy has called for the end to synthetic food dyes in US food, in his move to address health conditions and obesity in Americans.

The US Sun reported on the popular products like Gatorade, Skittles and M&M's that fell under Kennedy's announcement.

In an April press release, the Health Secretary said: ""For too long, some food producers have been feeding Americans petroleum-based chemicals without their knowledge or consent.

We take pride in the high-quality ingredients that go into our products, but what truly differentiates us are the ingredients we consciously leave out

Julie Barber, Sam's Club Chief Merchant

""These poisonous compounds offer no nutritional benefit and pose real, measurable dangers to our children’s health and development. That era is coming to an end.""

Kennedy also hinted that this is a top priority for Donald Trump after he spoke to the heads of some top food and drink brands.

In attendance at Kennedy's meeting were CEOs from General Mills, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo North America, JM Smucker, Tyson Foods, WK Kellogg, and the Consumer Brands Association.

Some of the notable dyes being taken out includes Red Due 40, which is commonly used in things like sports drinks and chips.

FDA Commissioner Marty Makary cited a study from The Lancet science journal.

It found that artificial colors could ""result in increased hyperactivity"" among children when consumed.

Makary said: ""Now, there's no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic.

""And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step.

""For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/600-stores-vows-scrap-receipt-870924589.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1280&h=720&crop=1,N,,2025-06-12 22:29:25.242962

Medtronic is targeting completion of the planned separation within 18 months of its initial announcement, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements.
The planned standalone diabetes company will maintain its focus on technologies that help manage blood glucose levels and reduce the burden of diabetes care, according to the company statement.
Medtronic’s planned separation of its Diabetes business and Boston Scientific’s product discontinuation highlight the dynamic nature of the sector.","NEW YORK - Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), a $113 billion healthcare giant with a ""GREAT"" financial health rating according to InvestingPro, announced Thursday that its planned diabetes business spinoff will be named MiniMed, reviving the original name of the diabetes technology company it acquired in 2001.

The name selection honors the 40-year legacy of the diabetes care business that was founded in 1983 by entrepreneur Alfred E. Mann, according to a press release statement from the healthcare technology company. The parent company has built a strong track record of shareholder returns, maintaining dividend payments for 49 consecutive years with a current yield of 3.2%.

""We’re thrilled to honor this rich 40-year legacy with a name that carries deep meaning and trust,"" said Que Dallara, current EVP and President of Medtronic Diabetes and Chief Executive Officer designate of MiniMed.

The diabetes business, based in Northridge, California, employs more than 8,000 people focused on developing technologies for diabetes management. The unit produces devices including the MiniMed 780G system, an automated insulin delivery system for type 1 diabetes patients.

Medtronic is targeting completion of the planned separation within 18 months of its initial announcement, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements. While the company currently prefers a split-off structure, a final decision has not been reached, and the separation may occur through various capital markets transactions.

The spinoff is part of Medtronic’s strategy to streamline its operations. The company noted that the separation remains subject to consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

The planned standalone diabetes company will maintain its focus on technologies that help manage blood glucose levels and reduce the burden of diabetes care, according to the company statement. With Medtronic’s current revenue of $33.5 billion and healthy gross margins of 65.5%, the spinoff comes at a time when the company appears fairly valued based on InvestingPro’s comprehensive Fair Value analysis. Investors seeking deeper insights into Medtronic’s valuation and growth prospects can access the detailed Pro Research Report, available exclusively to InvestingPro subscribers.

In other recent news, Medtronic, Inc. reported its fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 results, which included plans to spin off its Diabetes business into a separate public entity. This division accounts for approximately 8% of the company’s total revenue. Following this announcement, Needham analysts maintained a Hold rating on Medtronic stock, while Truist Securities adjusted its price target to $92, reflecting a positive response to the company’s organic revenue growth of 5.4%, although margins did not meet expectations. RBC Capital Markets also revised its price target for Medtronic to $101, maintaining an Outperform rating, citing the company’s Cardiovascular division’s strong performance as a factor. Stifel analysts held a Hold rating with a $87 target, noting potential tariff pressures impacting the company’s fiscal 2026 outlook.

Boston Scientific Corporation announced it would halt worldwide sales of its ACURATE neo2 and ACURATE Prime products due to increased clinical and regulatory requirements. Despite this, Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating and $112 price target, with the company expecting to meet its second-quarter and full-year 2025 sales and earnings guidance. The discontinuation of these products may have implications for competitors like Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic, which offer similar products.

Overall, these developments reflect strategic shifts and regulatory challenges impacting major players in the medical technology industry. Medtronic’s planned separation of its Diabetes business and Boston Scientific’s product discontinuation highlight the dynamic nature of the sector. Analysts’ ratings and adjustments provide a nuanced view of the companies’ prospects amid these changes.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is marking its 10th anniversary as an independent company with a massive rebranding campaign that replaces the traditional Hewlett Packard Enterprise longhand with an eye-catching new HPE logo.

The “bold” new HPE logo in all capital letters with the traditional green element as part of the “E” replaces the traditional, full-name Hewlett Packard Enterprise brand with the green element above it.

The new brand launches today June 12 on HPE’s website, social media channels, and with new digital signage, digital advertising and demand-gen marketing materials.

Besides the new logo, the rebranding includes a new verbal identity and a new culture blueprint.

The new HPE brand logo will be on full display at HPE Discover from June 23 – 26 in Las Vegas at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center and at the Sphere entertainment arena. In addition, it will be displayed on the iconic sphere exterior and will be featured in HPE CEO Antonio Neri’s Sphere keynote.

The new brand comes 10 years after the legendary Silicon Valley crown jewel Hewlett Packard was split into two companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which took hold of the original company’s enterprise products, and HP Inc. which is focused on PCs and printers.

The capital letters of the “bold” HPE brand show “confidence and strength” that is matched with the company’s new “verbal identity” that declares HPE as the “partner that unlocks your ambition – as a leader, a doer, a visionary or a changemaker,” said HPE Vice President of Brand, Culture and Creative Paula Berg.

Even with the massive rebranding with the HPE logo signaling the company’s advancements in AI, hybrid cloud and networking as an “essential partner in the AI era” the full Hewlett Packard Enterprise name will continue to be used to identify the company.

“It’s a pretty big change, a big deal,” said Berg in an interview with CRN. “Our name as a company remains Hewlett Packard Enterprise of course, but our new logo we think mirrors the shorthand that people use to talk about us, most people just say HPE.”

The old Hewlett Packard Enterprise full name logo was a “mouthful” that took up a “lot of space” on displays at big events where HPE was looking to stand out, said Berg.

“In a big stadium if you see it, it doesn’t always read well from a distance,” she said. “On a small screen it doesn’t always read well in a sea of logos because it is so big. So when we were thinking about what we wanted for this next iteration, we wanted something simple. We wanted something that really stood out!”

HPE has also unveiled a new GreenLake logo with the old HPE GreenLake logo replaced by a sleek new “greenlake by HPE” logo with a lowercase greenlake featuring the green element as part of the small “g” combined with the eye-catching new HPE logo.

HPE will maintain the green rectangle element, which has become synonymous with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, on its products without the HPE logo.

Neri, who studied art for nine years and was a professor of drawing and painting, helped lead the creation of the new branding. “Our CEO loves it,” said Berg of the new logo and rebranding.

Berg said the new branding recognizes the “rapid adoption of AI” and the power of HPE’s AI, hybrid cloud and networking portfolio. “HPE today should be synonymous with AI, cloud and networking the way we were synonymous with printers, servers and storage in a previous era,” she said. “We’re the partner that customers want and need right now. They are telling us they are looking for this holistic, high-impact, innovative partner to navigate the AI era. They want a partner they can trust to scale across their organization. They want all their tech in one place. They want a seamless integration into their environment. We are that company. We are made for this moment.”

The new branding campaign is a culmination of 18 months of work to deliver the new branding that “clearly defines who we are now and sends a strong signal to all of our stakeholders that HPE is an essential partner for the AI era,” said Berg.

HPE Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Jennifer Temple said in a blog post that the new HPE visual is a “bold expression of HPE today and the future” the company is shaping.

“Our advancements in AI, hybrid cloud, and networking have made us an essential partner in the AI era,” said Temple in the blog post. “And with five of the world’s top 10 supercomputers — including El Capitan at #1 — we’re leading the way in AI-driven computing worldwide. Our new brand reflects that future. It’s modern, focused, and aligned to what ambitious organizations need: expertise, ingenuity, and the ability to integrate and scale — no matter the challenge.”

Temple said as the world evolves in the AI era so does HPE’s technology and brand. “As HPE approaches its 10-year anniversary, it’s time we evolve how we show up too,” she said. “Today, we debut a new brand. It’s a sharp expression of who we are, how we work, and the transformative impact we deliver for our customers every day.”

The official global activation of the new HPE brand logo with partners will take place on August 18 with new marketing materials and assets that will be in place for partner co-marketing campaigns and new training for partners on the new branding.

HPE said the message to partners on the rebranding is clear: “We’re in this together and we want to do everything we can to make us both successful. We want to make this as easy and mutually beneficial as possible.”

Kathleen Kinka, chief marketing officer for Comport Consulting, No. 231 on the 2025 CRN SP500, said she is a “fan” of the new HPE brand which she called simple and yet also comprehensive.

""Ten years in our business is a long time,” she said. “It was a time for a refresh. HPE is a different company than it was 10 years ago. It’s unifying and showcases HPE as the only company that is a platform company that has end-to-end capabilities. The new brand reflects that capability.”

Kinka said she was particularly impressed with the thoughtfulness and preparation that took into consideration the role of partners in the rebranding effort. “They really thought about it from the point of view of the partner with regard to how long it would take us to make changes,” she said.

Kinka said the new branding recognizes HPE as a company that has continually changed and evolved and gotten ahead of the fast-moving technology trends particularly in AI. “HPE has innovative, leadership products in the AI space so customers can quickly get into AI (with HPE Private Cloud AI) and accelerate with services that are packaged. They don’t have to integrate everything. It’s a unifying play and it’s very timely.”

Comport has also evolved its brand, said Kinka, to emphasize- like HPE- the “essential” IT services it provides customers with a full suite of managed services like ComportSecure.

Berg, for her part, said the use of the word “essential” in the HPE corporate description as the leader in “essential enterprise technology, bringing together the power of AI, cloud and networking to help organizations achieve more” is critical.

“We think essential means it is absolutely necessary,” she said. “It is extremely important. It is something you don’t want to live without. We want to be that partner.”",https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/media_178081a3fd9805d3d0e90cdfd8a09a68c41bb68c1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-06-12 22:49:22.962760

“That’s why we strongly support No Tax on Tips and the inclusion of independent contractors.
Uber and DoorDash have launched public campaigns supporting the House version.
Financial experts say it’s impossible to estimate how much of their tips self-employed delivery drivers lose to federal taxes due to varying income brackets.
“When companies like Instacart, Uber, and DoorDash support ‘no tax on tips’ legislation, they are signaling alignment with the cultural and economic realities of today’s workforce,” Ms. Gianchandani said.","Instacart has joined Uber Eats and DoorDash in calling on Congress to include their app delivery drivers in “no tax on tips” legislation that would exempt gratuities from federal income tax.

The San Francisco-based food delivery service told The Washington Times that the House version of the bill, which includes gig workers as “independent contractors,” would free their drivers from reporting billions of dollars as taxable income.

Known as “shoppers,” the company’s self-employed workers use the Instacart app to purchase food and deliver it to customers. They typically earn $15 to $20 an hour before travel expenses, including substantial tips.

“At Instacart, we’re committed to supporting shoppers and helping them maximize their earnings,” an Instacart spokesperson said. “That’s why we strongly support No Tax on Tips and the inclusion of independent contractors. This is a matter of fairness and ensuring all workers are able to keep more of their hard-earned income.”

According to the Flex Association, an industry group, roughly 600,000 of the nation’s 7.3 million app-based drivers work for Instacart. Instacart said they collectively earned over $15 billion between the company’s founding in 2012 and 2023.

While President Trump made “no tax on tips” a signature campaign proposal last year, it remains unclear what the Republican-controlled Congress will pass out of reconciliation for his signature.

The Senate passed a version of the tax break on May 20 that covers only hotel, beauty, beverage, food service, pizza delivery and other traditional employees. It caps the deduction at $25,000 a year.

The House version of the bill passed two days later. This proposed tax break expires at the end of 2028, has no cap on deductions, exempts overtime on top of tips, and includes self-employed contractors.

Both versions of the legislation limit the tax break to people earning under $160,000 in 2025. Social Security and Medicare taxes would still apply.

Uber and DoorDash have launched public campaigns supporting the House version.

“Millions of hardworking Dashers deserve this tax cut, and now is the time for Dashers to make sure federal lawmakers get this right,” Max Rettig, DoorDash’s global head of public policy, said in April.

“We’ve met with lawmakers, shared your stories, and partnered with others in the industry to make the case,” Uber said in a message to drivers on the House bill’s passage.

Financial experts say it’s impossible to estimate how much of their tips self-employed delivery drivers lose to federal taxes due to varying income brackets.

But Angelica Gianchandani, a marketing instructor at New York University, said the apps’ public support for the House version of the bill is more about “acknowledging the dignity of invisible labor” than publicity.

“When companies like Instacart, Uber, and DoorDash support ‘no tax on tips’ legislation, they are signaling alignment with the cultural and economic realities of today’s workforce,” Ms. Gianchandani said. “Whether the bill passes may depend less on partisanship and more on whether lawmakers are ready to evolve with the modern economy, where flexibility, not formality, defines how we work.”

According to a recent Senate HELP Committee report, 1 in 3 Americans now engage in some independent work either full-time or to supplement part-time earnings.

A Morning Consult-Flex Association survey released in April 2023 found that over half of gig workers said it improved their financial security and 85% reported that it helped them manage inflation challenges.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/05/07/US_Instacart_Uber_Eats_00795_c0-447-5760-3807_s1200x700.jpg?650e54e5e2a9d4d7ca206fbb597fd374b9dc3f41,N,,2025-06-12 22:28:35.108609

A broad launch is planned across Canada and the US by the chain’s fiscal year 2026.

Starbucks chief technology officer Deb Hall Lefevre was quoted by CNBC: “It’s just another example of how innovation technology is coming into service of our partners and making sure that we’re doing all we can to simplify the operations, make their jobs just a little bit easier, maybe a little bit more fun, so that they can do what they do best.”

In addition to Green Dot Assist, Starbucks is previewing its next-generation point-of-sale (POS) system, which aims to improve order accuracy, uptime [the time in which machinery is in operation] and partner workflow.

The chain is testing pilot menu innovations via the Starting Five programme, in which select locations in the US trial new products.

From there, the activation will expand across Influential and Captiv8’s network of creators, covering 90% of influencers with more than one million followers, and 95% with more than 5000.

“Our journey began in 1983, when visionary entrepreneur Alfred E.

The company also said its warehouses will remain open an extra hour on Saturdays for all members, closing at 7 p.m.

Costco revealed that executive members all will receive a monthly $10 credit for orders of $150 placed through the company's ""Same-Day"" service or Instacart.

The company also recently expanded its gas station hours for all members to 6 a.m. Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Saturdays and 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Sundays. The move led to record fuel sales, Fox Business reported.

Saturday: 9 a.m. – 9:30 a.m.

Executive membership: $130 a year, includes two membership cards, 2% back on eligible purchases (up to $1,250), discounts on select services, and now early entry and a monthly $10 credit for orders of $150 placed through the company's ""Same-Day"" service or Instacart

Business memberships are also available for the same prices, with the option of allowing buyers to purchase for resale and add additional people to the account for $65 each.

Memberships are not required to buy Costco Pharmacy prescriptions online or in-store; non-members can get eye exams but can't buy glasses or contacts.

Anyone can shop at costco.com, but there is a 5% surcharge for non-members and some items are limited to members only. You can also shop with a Shop Card, a prepaid Costco gift card which must be purchased by a member.

Are any new Costcos coming to Florida?

Costco is opening at least nine new stores across the country in 2025. One of them opened in Stuart in April to about 1,000 people waiting outside.

However, more locations are also coming to The Villages and Sanford, and talks are in the works for more potential spots, including Port St. Lucie, Pensacola and Miami.

Where can I find a Costco near me in Florida?

As of June 12, there are 34 Costco locations in Florida. You can see the list here.

RadNet’s new term loan is slated to mature on April 18, 2031, coinciding with the $868.4 million balance on its existing credit line.
The nine-figure sum is in addition to its current cash balance of $717 million as of March 31.
In March, leaders shared plans to expand outside of RadNet’s eight core markets, potentially using the hefty cash balance.
“I'll emphasize that we do have an active pipeline of imaging center acquisition opportunities,” Stolper told investors in April.","Imaging center operator RadNet Inc. has scored a $100 million term loan, which it will use to fund future acquisitions and other “corporate initiatives.”

The Los Angeles-based radiology services provider announced the achievement Wednesday, with Barclays Bank PLC the lender. RadNet’s new term loan is slated to mature on April 18, 2031, coinciding with the $868.4 million balance on its existing credit line.

The nine-figure sum is in addition to its current cash balance of $717 million as of March 31. Leaders said these funds position RadNet to “advance our growth strategy and create long-term value for our stockholders.”

“We appreciate the continued support of Barclays and our relationship banks and term-loan lenders,” Mark Stolper, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in a statement June 11. “This incremental financing increases our capacity to execute on a pipeline of acquisition opportunities while maintaining our conservative capital structure.”

Quarterly payments of principal on the loan will be about $2.4 million compared to $2.2 million prior to the amendment. All other terms and covenants remain unchanged, Stolper and colleagues noted.

RadNet has executed several acquisitions in recent months while expressing the desire for more. Last week, the company said it had finalized the purchase of Australia-based ultrasound artificial intelligence vendor See-Mode Technologies for an undisclosed sum. Plus, in April it announced the planned acquisition of breast imaging AI company iCAD for $103 million, a deal funded with stock rather than cash or debt.

In March, leaders shared plans to expand outside of RadNet’s eight core markets, potentially using the hefty cash balance. Currently, the company operates 401 outpatient imaging centers across Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Texas. RadNet last expanded geographically into the Houston market in 2024, starting with the acquisition of Houston Medical Imaging and its seven centers.

“I'll emphasize that we do have an active pipeline of imaging center acquisition opportunities,” Stolper told investors in April. “I'm highly confident that we will put some capital to work this year with some of the dislocation in the capital markets, both on the equity side as well as the debt side. It's putting more and more pressure on some of the smaller operators, some of the private equity-owned operators, and that bodes well for more opportunities on the core imaging center side, going forward. We have been extremely disciplined with regards to price and valuation. We'll continue to be that way. We feel we have a very good sense of what businesses are worth in our industry, but I'm also highly confident that we'll get some transactions done this year.”",https://radiologybusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/assets/articles/Dollar.jpg?itok=P_wAx_2z,N,,2025-06-12 22:18:37.881482

Tesco is seeing an “intensification in competition”, however Murphy also described it as a “rational intensification, in the sense that everybody is kind of staying toe to toe with each other”.

Tesco intends to pull on all levers to maintain its position in an “intensely competitive market”, CEO Ken Murphy told media today (12 June) as the business reported its first quarter financial results.

“Customers are recognising that we are particularly competitive across all aspects of the shopping trip, not just price,” he said.

Tesco is seeing an “intensification in competition”, however Murphy also described it as a “rational intensification, in the sense that everybody is kind of staying toe to toe with each other”.

Tesco pledges to use ‘firepower’ in competitive market as brand perceptions soar

“So, you’re not necessarily seeing massive movement and relative competitiveness, but everyone has, I think, upped their game a notch and that would be broadly what we’re seeing across the industry,” he said.

Murphy claimed Tesco has responded “very effectively” to the competition, “without dropping the ball on quality and innovation”.

The retailer’s market share is up 44 basis points for the 12 weeks ending 18 May 2025, according to Kantar data, marking 24 consecutive four-week periods of share gains.

Tesco’s brand perception has also risen by 65 basis points, according to YouGov data, noting “progress across a broad range of pillars” such as quality and price.

Quality and price

“When it comes to value, quality is as important as price. So, we have continued our focus on improving and innovating across all our ranges,” said Murphy.

The CEO cited F&F Clothing’s move online in May and growth from fast delivery service Whoosh as contributing to Tesco’s market position.

The supermarket also launched more than 350 own brand products in the last quarter and is promising “exciting innovation” for its summer ranges.

Tesco Finest, the supermarket’s premium own brand offering, grew 18% “as the brand continues to resonate with customers looking for affordable ways to treat themselves”.

Group like-for-like sales grew by 4.6% to £16.4bn in the 13 weeks to 24 May. The retailer is maintaining its profit guidance first published in April, with an expected adjusted operating profit between £2.7bn and £3bn this year.

‘A blank sheet of paper’: Tesco’s marketing boss on the power of ‘restless’ leadership

“The market remained intensely competitive and we are committed to ensuring customers get the best value in the market by shopping at Tesco, we are therefore reiterating the full year guidance we gave in April,” explained Murphy.

Sales in the UK grew 5.1% – an uptick on last quarter’s 4.3% – while Republic of Ireland sales grew by 5.5%.

Overall food sales grew by 5.9%, while non-food sales excluding toys increased by 6.2%, boosted by warmer weather and innovation ahead of summer. Tesco’s online sales were up 11.5 percentage points.

Will BYD’s new Dolphin Surf spark a new EV price war overseas?","After China warned that BYD’s recent EV price cuts are creating “war panic,” the company is now turning up the pressure overseas. BYD launched its most affordable EV in Europe, the Dolphin Surf, starting at about $25,000. The tiny EV is BYD’s top seller in China. Will it have the same impact in Europe?

BYD’s EV price war heads overseas with the Dolphin Surf

The Dolphin Surf is the European version of BYD’s best-selling EV in China, the Seagull. The Seagull is already sold for under $10,000 (69,800 yuan) in China, but after another round of price cuts last month, it’s now listed at just $7,800 (55,800 yuan).

Although it didn’t single out BYD, the China Automobile Manufacturers Association warned earlier this month (via Bloomberg) that recent price cuts are “triggering a new round of price war panic” in China.

After launching the Dolphin Surf in the UK and Europe, starting at just £18,650 (just over $25,000), BYD is now bringing its EV price war overseas.

BYD outsold Tesla in the UK last month, registering 3,025 vehicles compared to Tesla with 2,016, and it’s quickly closing in on full-year sales.

In what’s being called a “watershed moment,” the Chinese EV giant also registered more vehicles than Tesla in Europe for the first time in April. And that’s before the Dolphin Surf arrived, which is now among the cheapest cars in the UK.

The UK’s cheapest EV is currently the Dacia Spring, starting at £14,995 ($20,000) with a WLTP range of 140 miles.

BYD’s base Dolphin Surf “Active” offers 203 miles WLTP range. A longer-range “Boost” variant is available with a range of up to 305 miles (507 km), starting at £21,950 ($30,000). Both include tech and features typically found on more premium vehicles, including a 10.1″ rotatable touchscreen and smart driving capabilities.

“Compact cars are the next frontier for electrification in Europe,” BYD’s executive vice president, Stella Li, said during the recent Dolphin Surf launch event in Rome.

Will BYD’s new Dolphin Surf spark a new EV price war overseas? Although China is warning it will have devastating impacts on domestic auto brands, it could fuel EV demand in Europe and the UK with more affordable options arriving.

Electrek’s Take

With a commanding lead in China, BYD is rapidly expanding its presence overseas to drive growth over the next few years.

According to S&P Global Mobility, BYD is expected to more than double its sales in Europe in 2025 to around 186,000 units. By 2030, BYD’s sales in Europe could reach upwards of 400,000.

And it’s not just Europe. BYD is already a leading EV brand in overseas markets, such as Brazil, Thailand, and Mexico, and is emerging as a threat in South Korea, Japan, and other key regions.

By building nearly all vehicle components in-house, including EV batteries and powertrains, BYD can offer electric vehicles at a significantly lower cost and still make a profit.

Its decision to stop making purely gas-powered vehicles in 2022 is already paying off as BYD emerges as a true global threat. One thing is for sure: BYD will be a brand to watch over the next few years as demand for lower-cost, efficient electric cars continues to grow.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/BYDs-EV-price-war-overseas.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-12 22:37:30.062935

UNH is

witnessing robust growth in its medical membership, reflecting a

strong demand for both commercial and government-supported health

plans. In 2023, the company served 47.2 million people in the

United States, which increased 5% year over year in 2024, followed

by 2% growth in the first quarter of 2025 to 50.1 million. As of

March 31, 2025, UnitedHealthcare served around 780,000

consumers.

One of the major driving factors of this growth is

UnitedHealth's vertically integrated strategy. This strategy brings

together its insurance unit, UnitedHealthcare, with its care

delivery and pharmacy services through the Optum unit. By providing

coordinated, value-based care, the company has been able to attract

both seniors and those enrolled in employer-sponsored plans.

However, UNH had to suspend its full-year guidance due to

unexpectedly high medical costs in the Medicare Advantage segment

in the first quarter of 2025. The return of its new CEO, Steve

Hemsley, indicates a strong focus on operations, improved pricing,

adjusted risk and improved care coordination.

Membership numbers are on the rise, but to keep that

sustainable, it will require careful planning and tighter control

over costs. With the 2026 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid

Services (CMS) rate increase on the way and a changing competitive

environment, the company has to find a way to balance between

growing and staying profitable.

How are Competitors Faring?

Some of UNH's major competitors in the healthcare plan provider

space are

Humana Inc.

HUM and

Elevance Health, Inc.

ELV.

Humana's total medical membership of the insurance segment

declined 8.3% year over year in the first quarter of 2025 to 14.8

million. Humana anticipates Individual Medicare Advantage

membership to witness a decline of around 550,000 in 2025. Its

rising costs are concerning.

Elevance Health's total medical membership witnessed a decline

of 0.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2025 to 45.8

million. Elevance Health forecast medical enrollment between 45.8

and 46.7 million in 2025. Its rising costs are concerning.

Everyone wants AI as a growth engine.” French President Emmanuel Macron met with Mr. Huang and Arthur Mensch, co-founder of French AI startup Mistral AI, during the event.
The new initiative, named Mistral Compute, will be located about 30 kilometers south of Paris, in the Essonne department.
Nvidia also showcased its advances in robotics with Grek, a robot trained in a virtual environment.
On stage, Grek walked, jumped, and danced with Mr. Huang.","Nvidia’s founder and CEO Jensen Huang unveiled an ambitious vision for the future of computing and artificial intelligence on Wednesday (11) in Paris, forecasting a new industrial revolution led by robots trained in virtual environments.

Speaking at the most anticipated session of a multi-day event hosted by Publicis Groupe, Mr. Huang said the world is entering the era of AI agents—autonomous systems powered by large language models—and emphasized that AI is now capable of applying learned rules to solve new problems “just like an intelligent human being.”

“We are launching a new wave of AI. Intelligence means perception, reasoning, planning, and execution,” he said.

During his nearly two-hour keynote, Mr. Huang announced the creation of the world’s first industrial AI cloud, to be based in Germany and equipped with 10,000 GPUs—electronic circuits designed to perform high-speed mathematical operations. The infrastructure will serve European manufacturers in areas ranging from product design to engineering, robotics, and logistics. Partners in the initiative include Siemens, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Toyota.

He also revealed plans to open or expand AI centers in seven European countries—France, Sweden, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland—to develop, train, and deploy AI models. According to Mr. Huang, Europe is on track to increase its AI capacity tenfold within two years.

“These AI data centers are not classic data centers. They are revenue-generating facilities designed to manufacture tokens—tokens that can be transformed into productive intelligence across sectors,” Mr. Huang said. “These AI factories are now part of a country’s infrastructure. That’s why you see me traveling the world, talking to heads of state. Everyone wants AI factories. Everyone wants AI as part of their national infrastructure. Everyone wants AI as a growth engine.”

French President Emmanuel Macron met with Mr. Huang and Arthur Mensch, co-founder of French AI startup Mistral AI, during the event. The meeting included the announcement of a partnership to build European AI infrastructure.

The new initiative, named Mistral Compute, will be located about 30 kilometers south of Paris, in the Essonne department. It will initially feature a 40-megawatt data center, with potential expansion to 100 megawatts. The launch is planned for 2026.

The facility will be equipped with around 18,000 of Nvidia’s latest and most advanced—and expensive—superchips, each costing between $30,000 and $70,000.

France 2030

The project is part of France 2030, a national investment plan launched by Macron in 2021 that commits €54 billion through the end of the decade to accelerate the country’s digital and energy transition. The program focuses on emerging technologies such as AI, robotics, biotechnology, and clean energy.

Founded just two years ago, Mistral AI is reportedly aiming to raise around $1 billion to make the project viable, Financial Times reported. The startup plans to scale up from developing AI models to also offering the computing power to train and run them, through its own servers installed in France.

Calling the alliance “historic,” Mr. Macron said it marked a paradigm shift for Europe. “We want our own cloud, our own data centers, our own computing capabilities, and all the services and infrastructure that allow us to preserve this intelligence and the diversity of who we are. This is our fight for sovereignty and strategic autonomy,” he said.

Later, in a conversation with French entrepreneurs, Mr. Macron reiterated his vision of innovation grounded in European values and warned against external dependence. “I don’t believe in a Europe that follows the United States in a post-humanist model. I believe in our values. But we need to regain our strength. Eighteen months ago, France had no major data centers. We were losing the battle. Now we have Mistral, Nvidia, and we’re climbing the ranks,” he said.

Nvidia also showcased its advances in robotics with Grek, a robot trained in a virtual environment. On stage, Grek walked, jumped, and danced with Mr. Huang. “An industrial revolution has begun. The next waves of AI have started. Greg is a perfect example of what’s now possible in robotics,” Mr. Huang said. “Every industry will be affected. And a new industry will also emerge—just like what happened with electricity.”

Leading organizations today embed sustainable practices across all aspects of their operations—from product development to customer engagement to community support.","In an exclusive interaction with Asia Business Outlook, Greg Lukasik, SVP & CEO of Ecolab Southeast Asia, discusses how aligning organizational culture with long-term strategic goals enables companies to foster innovation, sustainability, and operational efficiency. He advocates for a purpose-driven mindset, digital transformation, customer-centric innovation, and workforce development as essential pillars for building resilient, future-ready businesses. A seasoned business leader, Greg Lukasik brings over two decades of global leadership experience across industrial sectors. He specializes in strategy, sales, marketing, and general management, with a strong track record in driving sustainable growth and operational excellence.

A strong organizational culture is crucial for driving long-term success. How can businesses ensure that their culture is aligned with strategic goals to foster collaboration, innovation, and performance?

In the evolving business landscape, organizations with a clear, purpose driven culture are better placed to create competitive advantages that sustain the business, encourage innovation, and leave a lasting, realized impact. A strong organizational culture is no longer just an inner strength, but also a strategic differentiator.

The first stage for any organization is to make sure that leadership openly and consistently defines its purpose and values to employees, customers, community partners, suppliers and other stakeholders in a way that is grounded within their experience of the organization.

Sustainability is a core of purpose-driven strategies. Leading organizations today embed sustainable practices across all aspects of their operations—from product development to customer engagement to community support. For instance, Ecolab partners with industries to help reduce waste, conserve energy and water, and drive results at lower total costs. Their model demonstrates how sustainability can be both a business imperative and a customer value proposition.

Mindset is another cultural lever worth promoting. High-performing organizations build leadership frameworks that deliberately prioritize innovation, inclusion, learning, and customer-centricity into their organizational mindsets. These mindsets help teams continuously think about opportunities for value-delivery and ensure they can pivot, adapt to changes, and focus their efforts on the purpose of their work. Investing in the establishment of a culture of high performance that embraces continuous improvement provides not only an opportunity for growth but also strengthen the ability of the company to bring and deliver sustainable solutions to problems of concern.

Finally, consistency is important. Cultures thrive when values are instilled and reinforced consistently in markets, teams, and even customers - creating a feeling of shared mission while allowing improvisation due to local market adaptations. If a company operates across multiple regions with diverse customer cultures, providing a shared but adaptable culture with a shared core to the organization can bolster collaboration, innovation, and sustainable performance.

Ultimately, companies that think about culture as a strategic advantage and place the necessary investments into making sure culture is aligned with their long-term vision, enable themselves to collectively build a resilient team that is innovative and high-performing in the future.

Businesses often struggle to align short-term performance pressures with the need for long-term strategic investment. How can companies effectively balance these two seemingly conflicting priorities to foster sustainable growth?

Organizations today are feeling constant pressures to produce immediate results while at the same time develop for the future. I believe the capacity to deliver on both short and long-term missions is about establishing a direct and purposeful link between near-term activities and long-term goals.

This means embedding long-term strategic objectives into everyday decision-making is the first step. This includes establishing performance metrics that reward not just successes, but for making tangible progress against goals, such as building capability, innovation, or entering new markets. Continuous investment in digital technology and building talent isn't going to have an immediate impact on financial performance but are important for driving results over the long-term and maintaining competitive advantage.

An agile approach is equally essential. By breaking down long-term initiatives into manageable milestones, organizations can deliver incremental wins that build confidence, demonstrate value, and allow for adaptation as market conditions evolve. Agility ensures that progress remains steady without losing sight of overarching goals.

Just as important is fostering a culture of transparency and alignment. Ensuring that every team understands how their daily efforts contribute to the broader strategy creates a sense of ownership and purpose.

Companies that succeed are those that consistently deliver results, while investing boldly in the capabilities and innovations that will define their future.

Understanding customer needs is essential to drive relevant innovation. How can businesses ensure that their innovation strategies remain customer-centric without being overly influenced by short-term trends?

Firstly, the best companies are customer-focused and listen continuously. Not just around current challenges, but also their customers’ emerging priorities and future ambitions. By building long-term partnerships focused on solving systemic issues, businesses can align innovation efforts with lasting customer value, rather than fleeting market shifts.

For instance, in sectors facing increasing resource constraints, solutions like circular water management have emerged not because of short-term pressures, but because they address a long-term, structural challenge critical to customers' sustainability and operational resilience.

Secondly, embedding a robust needs-assessment framework also helps focus action on the objectives that will provide returns on action both now and in the future. The ability to use data insights, horizon-scan market patterns, and leverage co-creation with customers, rather than react to each new trend, allows organizations to mitigate the risk of innovation investments being poorly aligned and provide the most ongoing relevance. For instance, deploying advanced technologies like real-time monitoring of processes, and predictive analytics may expose inefficiencies and reveal risks that the customer may not have yet fully recognized, keeps you ahead in both meeting needs and expectations.

Thirdly, the best firms instill a balance between agility and discipline in their culture. It’s important to stay responsive to evolving customer requirements without losing sight of the broader mission. Cross-functional integration of research and development, customer-facing, and strategy groups could help organizations look at trends with a view to long-term consumer outcomes.

To make sure that innovation strategies remain consumer-centric, firms must think beyond short-term trends but rather think about long-term value for consumers. This starts with deep understanding of evolving customer priorities, not just what they need today but what will matter tomorrow. Also embedded in innovation are principles like sustainability, resilience, and compliance, which will help an organization deliver for consumers in relevant and future-fit ways. Businesses can foster lasting customer trust and differentiation in a rapidly changing market by prioritizing solutions that enhance performance while supporting broader environmental and societal outcomes.

In short, businesses that listen deeply, think long-term, and innovate responsibly will ensure their strategies remain customer-centric, delivering relevance today and resilience for tomorrow.

Effective resource allocation is a key challenge for businesses aiming for sustainable growth. How can businesses optimize their use of resources to support innovation while maintaining operational efficiency?

It is important to engage your customers not only on what they need today, but also on their future risks and opportunities. Water and resource scarcity management are major areas of need across our region fast becoming concerns. Businesses that address these challenges today will be better equipped to be resilient in the future. Through creating and implementing advanced AI-driven technologies, providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and proactive maintenance insights - businesses have been able to transition from reactive to preventative actions, anchored within improved operational performance and sustainability in the long run.

I believe innovation needs to be linked directly to recognized outcomes. Our development of a partnership with Digital Realty (a leading global data center), is an excellent example of this. We implemented AI-driven monitoring into their cooling system to identify inefficiencies and make improvements that will lead to water savings of approximately 15% to conserve operations and protect local watersheds. Businesses that support their innovation and aspirations within a clearly defined environmental and operational ROI can encourage stronger customer loyalty and increased long-term competitive advantage over time.

Ultimately, businesses should consider their work as part of a systems-level process. As an example, programs like Ecolab Water for Climate demonstrate that organizations can leverage a framework for their work, understand their objectives and intentions, build insights, take action, and measure outcomes, in order to consistently realize sustainability goals as operational reality.

Equally important is investing in the future workforce. Strengthening technical education and occupational skills development ensures a strong talent pipeline aligned to emerging sectors like water management and digital infrastructure. Companies that invest in skills for the future today will be better positioned to respond to future market demands.

Customer-orientated innovation is not just about technology; it is a mindset.

Tech and media companies’ race to automate advertising poses a threat to the giant agency holding companies that have for decades dominated that work, industry analysts say.

Share prices of agency networks including Publicis Groupe, Omnicom, WPP and Interpublic fell by approximately 3% to 4% last week following a Wall Street Journal report that Meta Platforms plans to release AI tools by the end of 2026 automating the entire process of creating and placing ads.

This was conveyed by Koster at the BBTF travel exhibition in response to the previous condition in which the company that owns the Aqua drinking water brand was the only one who did not agree with this policy.

Moreover, the policy to stop the production and distribution of AMDK is considered the only option for the common good.
PT Danone Indonesia agreed with a request for relief, namely an extension of the limit for 6 months for adjustment.","Bali Governor Wayan Koster finally destroyed the giant drinking water company PT Danone Indonesia to stop the production of bottled drinking water (AMDK) under 1 liter in Bali.

This was conveyed by Koster at the BBTF travel exhibition in response to the previous condition in which the company that owns the Aqua drinking water brand was the only one who did not agree with this policy.

""Of these 18 manufacturers, only one was a bit annoying, Danone, an Aqua beverage producer, the other day I called the second, finally softened,"" said Koster, Thursday, June 12.

The Bali Provincial Government has made a policy to prohibit the production and distribution of AMDK under 1 liter starting in 2026, this aims to suppress the emergence of plastic waste in the midst of the complicated waste problems on the Island of the Gods.

Koster explained that during the first meeting only the company had not yet agreed on this policy, so he emphasized that if it was not complied with, the permit would be revoked.

""If everything else is okay, so I forbid producing, I summon all single-use plastic drink producers so that they obey the policy for banning production, circulation, and use,"" he said.

The threat of revocation of this distribution permit was then granted to PT Danone Indonesia, even the Bali Provincial Government would ask the district/city government to revoke its permit to the grassroots.

This process is also to see the permits of bottled drinking water companies in Bali, because if their permits are complete, they are only sanctioned because they do not comply and if they are found that the permits are also incomplete, they will be subject to criminal sanctions.

""Just for me, if he doesn't obey, I have to revoke it, don't make it good for him to make a profit, make garbage, other people are told to take care of it, then our tourism has a declining image,"" said the Governor of Bali.

The Bali Provincial Government is confident in the policy included in the Circular Letter of the Governor of Bali Number 9 of 2025 concerning the Bali Cleaning Waste Movement, because support from various elements has been pocketed, including from the Minister of Environment.

Moreover, the policy to stop the production and distribution of AMDK is considered the only option for the common good.

PT Danone Indonesia agreed with a request for relief, namely an extension of the limit for 6 months for adjustment.

""It is necessary to shift technology and adapt the workforce to switch from single-use plastic production to environmentally friendly products, I will give you an additional 6 months, until June 2026,"" said Koster.",https://imgsrv2.voi.id/9llYH2I302FljGvo2SZOqXFAtD6PB4nw26kHMkg4Zl0/rs:fill/w:800/h:450/g:sm/wm:1:nowe:0:0:1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy80ODgyODYvMjAyNTA2MTIyMTA3LW1haW4uY3JvcHBlZF8xNzQ5NzM3MjgyLmpwZWc.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:25:05.920950

“I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity for our company,” Niccol told NBC News’ Hallie Jackson in an interview.
Starbucks’ fiscal year concludes at the end of September.
There’s also a chance, according to Niccol, that Starbucks may roll out trendy mushroom-infused coffees in future.
“The thing that’s great about Starbucks is we’re a global company.","Despite price pressures from tariffs and an extended sales slump, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said he is optimistic the company is on the comeback trail.

“I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity for our company,” Niccol told NBC News’ Hallie Jackson in an interview.

Niccol is known as a turnaround expert, given his experience running Chipotle, which thrived under his watch. He’s looking to replicate that success at Starbucks, the biggest coffee company in the world with 32,000 locations and $36 billion in annual revenue as of the last fiscal year.

Competition from the likes of Dunkin', McDonald's and Dutch Bros. has taken a toll on Starbucks, as has consumers' weariness of stubborn inflation and rising prices. The company’s same-store sales have fallen for five straight quarters, and it announced in April that its profit was cut in half compared to a year earlier.

Since taking over in September, though, Niccol has rolled out changes to Starbucks’ business model — cutting 30% of its menu, requiring that customers buy a menu item to sit in its stores and introducing a new “green apron” service model that uses an algorithm to help baristas sequence orders. Starbucks' stock is on the upswing since the company’s lackluster earnings report in late April. Its growth this year has outpaced gains in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Niccol pinned the company’s recent struggles on a lack of focus on customers’ experience.

“We veered away from, I think, owning the idea of the third place, the coffeehouse experience, making sure that the customer was front and center,” Niccol said.

Prices are a big part of his proposition to customers, as well.

“That was our commitment. For this fiscal year we’re not moving on prices. What I can’t commit to is where the future goes,” Niccol said. Starbucks’ fiscal year concludes at the end of September.

“But what I definitely can commit to,” he added, “is we’re going to give people a great experience so that what you get for what they pay, they feel like they got a great value.”

Starbucks is introducing some targeted new products, including a new protein vanilla latte this week in select stores. There’s also a chance, according to Niccol, that Starbucks may roll out trendy mushroom-infused coffees in future.

Niccol acknowledged the company will continue to deal with external challenges — especially from Washington. President Donald Trump’s uniform 10% tariff on all imports will likely raise the cost of Starbucks’ raw coffee beans, which Niccol said “frankly cannot be grown in the United States.”

But Niccol is confident Starbucks can withstand any additional costs.

“The thing that’s great about Starbucks is we’re a global company. We’re an iconic brand,” Niccol said. “We have the flexibility and scale to navigate wherever these policy changes go.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250612-Starbucks-RS-a33487.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:39:42.983552

This compares to earnings of $0.06 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 44.83%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this auto retailer would post a loss of $0.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.37, delivering a surprise of 3,800%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

America's Car-Mart, which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Whole Sales industry, posted revenues of $370.17 million for the quarter ended April 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $364.67 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

America's Car-Mart shares have added about 12.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.4%.

What's Next for America's Car-Mart?

While America's Car-Mart has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for America's Car-Mart: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.69 on $375.49 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.55 on $1.51 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Retail and Whole Sales is currently in the top 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, Levi Strauss (LEVI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended May 2025.

This jeans maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Levi Strauss' revenues are expected to be $1.37 billion, down 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.

Mars Inc. has overhauled its global marketing operations and picked Publicis Groupe to lead a wide range of communications activities. Mediapost in its report said this followed a closely contested review process that began in late 2024.

This move gives Publicis control over Mars’ media planning and buying, content production, social media engagement, influencer partnerships and commerce integration.

COMvergence reports that Mars allocated around $1.76 billion to global media efforts in 2024.

This development delivers another setback to WPP, which previously managed the media account but now exits the picture.

For Publicis to handle and Mars global media vision is a decision that follows a recent client losses for WPP, including Coca-Cola’s North American business and Paramount, both now with Publicis.

Publicis will also join a newly structured agency model called “One Mars,” designed to streamline collaboration across partners.

IPG-owned Weber Shandwick will lead brand public relations across Mars’ diverse portfolio, including M&M’s, Snickers, Twix, Skittles, and pet care products.

Mars confirmed it will retain its primary creative partners, Omnicom and T&P, as the latest review did not include creative assignments.

Gülen Bengi, Chief Marketing Officer for Mars and Growth Officer for its snacking division, described the move as a bold redesign of audience connection.

Bengi said Mars must constantly evolve to keep its brands relevant.

The CMO emphasised that this strategy goes beyond media and focuses on a growth model that puts people and pets at the center.

She added that Mars aims to co-create meaningful experiences with fans across all platforms.

Arthur Sadoun, Chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe, welcomed the deepened collaboration.

He said Publicis looks forward to redefining how Mars engages with customers and communities worldwide.

A vermifilter system for reducing nutrients and organic-strength of dairy wastewater.","Decarbonizing dairy is a challenge that no single company can address alone. For several years, Danone has been working with its suppliers to integrate sustainability into its contracts, actively engaging in collaborative projects to accelerate emission reduction in dairy farming.

Through this partnership with Leprino, we aim to reduce emissions on dairy farms in the USA, with a focus on manure management practices. The objective is to select levers that not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also deliver significant co-benefits to the resilience of farms, notably impacting water, soil health, and nutrient management planning of farmers.

BioFiltro wastewater treatment technology is a nature-based solution that uses worms and microbial bacteria to process the liquid from cow’s manure, preventing the formation of methane emissions from manure storage by up to 90%1, while drastically reducing nitrogen in the water applied to fields2.

By upcycling wastewater into irrigation water, it provides farmers with flexible access to clean irrigation water that they can store and use when needed, a critical practice in areas like California where water can be a scarce resource.

By generating worm castings, which is a nutritious and valuable soil amendment, this technology can also contribute to improving crop yield and soil health.

Through this first installation, we expect an annual reduction of 40,000 tons of GHG emissions starting in 2026 and the upcycling of nearly 0.7 billion liters of wastewater per year.

This initiative marks new progress in Danone’s global roadmap to build more resilient dairy farming models. It supports farmers in their transition to regenerative agricultural practices while investing in innovative solutions adapted to each farm’s profile.

Opened in 1993, the store became the first (and still only) location on Earth where the arches match the landscape rather than the corporate style guide.

Sedona’s council insisted the normal school-bus yellow would compete with the rust-colored buttes that drive the town’s tourism. After months of back-and-forth, McDonald’s designers settled on Pantone 321, a blue-green shade that echoes desert succulents and Native jewelry. The arches shine at about 70 percent of the usual brightness to meet the city’s low-glare limits.

What started as a zoning requirement is now an attraction in its own right, drawing steady streams of selfie-seekers who spend a few extra dollars inside.A store manager told local press that foot traffic runs 5–8 percent higher than at a similar-size McDonald’s in Flagstaff.

Corporate headquarters quietly keeps the color and lighting specs on file in case other towns request muted arches. Sedona’s choice shows how local design rules can even help the bottom line.

How big brands blend into their surroundings

Sedona’s McDonalds is not the only store which has adapted like a chameleon to its surroundings:

Starbucks, Forbidden City (Beijing): No mermaid sign outside; the storefront uses dark timber and Chinese calligraphy to respect the palace aesthetics.

IKEA, Burbank (California): Exterior painted a slate blue 50 percent darker than the chain’s trademark hue after downtown officials asked for less visual “noise.”

Apple Store, Georgetown (Washington, DC): A restored 1880s brick façade bears only a subtle etched logo; modernization happens behind original windows and cornices.

McDonald’s, Freeport (Maine): Cedar shingles, white trim, and a wooden arch conform to the town’s colonial-heritage code rather than fast-food prefab styling.

Cities defend these rules with numbers. A National Trust Main Street study shows districts with tight façade guidelines saw property values rise nine percent faster than comparison areas over a decade. Sedona’s own tourism board found visitor satisfaction scores drop by up to 25 percent when neon clutter dominates scenic views.

When brands lean into contrast and turn into landmarks

On the other hand, some companies prefer to play it dangerous and bet on iconic (and polemical) exteriors:

Louis Vuitton Maison, Fifth Avenue (New York): A multi-story glass skin shaped like translucent travel trunks commands attention next to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Annual foot traffic rose 22 percent its first year.

Apple Cube, Fifth Avenue (New York): A glowing 32-foot glass cube entrance to an underground store became a top-ten spot on Manhattan Instagram maps.

Selfridges, Birmingham (UK): Fifteen-thousand aluminum disks ripple across curved walls, lifting mall visits by 30 percent after opening.

Uniqlo Megastore, Ginza (Tokyo): A digital façade plays color animations and brand messages, turning the entire building into a street-level billboard.

The contrast strategy can be pricey. Louis Vuitton’s Fifth Avenue frontage reportedly cost $100 million, yet sales per square foot doubled, giving the chain its best-performing U.S. location.

Even modest tweaks carry a bill: Sedona’s custom arches added about $150,000 in design and lighting changes, but extra tourist traffic recouped that within four years.

Context, contrast, and the bottom line

So how does a company decide between blending in and standing out? Tourist towns or heritage districts favor subtlety; a lower-key storefront keeps the skyline coherent and preserves property values.

Urban retail corridors often welcome bold architecture because foot traffic translates directly into sales. On the corporate side, design compliance can shave three to six months off permit approval, saving six-figure rents. On the marketing side, a statement building can create its own buzz, functioning as a billboard that never turns off.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/mcdonalds-sedona-arizona.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:31:57.634850

The idea is to more readily connect sales and conversion data from a brand or merchant with campaign optimization happening on TTD.
The Connector App goes beyond a typical data onboarding setup, something Snowflake and TTD have had as an integration for years.
And for Snowflake it’s a useful tool because, within its internal structure, Media, Entertainment & Advertising is a totally separate vertical as Retail.
But they don’t think of Snowflake as a natural conduit for their retail media network businesses.","The Trade Desk on Thursday announced its first native app built for use with a separate cloud or data warehouse. It’s called the Connector App on Snowflake.

The idea is to more readily connect sales and conversion data from a brand or merchant with campaign optimization happening on TTD.

“Until now, a lot of what we’re talking about was present in Snowflake, but definitely required resourcing of a data engineering team in order to make it actionable,” Gabe Richman, TTD’s GM of global identity and platform strategy, told AdExchanger.

What’s different now, he said, is the data is immediately live. It never leaves the Snowflake account and can be operated by most ad tech or agency execs, he said.

Or, as put by David Wells, Snowflake’s industry principal for its Media, Entertainment & Advertising vertical, the data is now “accessible to non-technical personas.”

So, what’s the point?

Aside from simplifying the data science to be serviceable for people who don’t know the SQL coding language, there is one killer use case advantage with the new Connector App, Wells said. Retail conversion data can now be returned at the SKU level. Rather than having an aggregated view of sales in, say, the orange juice category, he said. Now, an advertiser or retailer might target the kinds of shoppers who prefer high-pulp OJ.

It’s a feature that more retail media advertisers are calling for, he said. So retailers are doing more to provide the “the granularity of insights in terms of what’s working.”

It is also the second time this week that TTD has announced a new data integration that is relatively innocuous, except for the fact that SKU-level sales information is being passed to the DSP. The other example being a new tie-up between TTD and Instacart and Ocado.

The Connector App goes beyond a typical data onboarding setup, something Snowflake and TTD have had as an integration for years. Onboarding is just a data dump and match, but with this live app native on Snowflake, live TTD campaigns can receive feedback on what types of media or targeting led to those sales.

And for Snowflake it’s a useful tool because, within its internal structure, Media, Entertainment & Advertising is a totally separate vertical as Retail. Many retailers use Snowflake as their data warehouse for planning and inventory management, or as a martech ecosystem hub, Wells said. But they don’t think of Snowflake as a natural conduit for their retail media network businesses.

But as TTD goes out and wins more business among retailers, their number of “mutuals” (which is to say, customer overlap) increases, Wells said. And then those retailers will see the use cases Snowflake has outside of the retail category, and within the ads vertical.",https://www.adexchanger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Great-Data-Lakes-Snowflake-AWS-Google-Cloud-Databricks-Microsoft-Azure-feature-comic.png,N,,2025-06-12 22:28:53.257539

We’re beginning with Kraft Heinz’s plans to invest $3 billion in upgrading its U.S. manufacturing facilities. The plant updates are intended to be more efficient and reduce costs while helping the Kraft Mac & Cheese and Heinz ketchup maker defend its market share. Check out this article about the company’s most significant manufacturing investment in 10 years.

In major robotics news, Kawasaki has unveiled a quadruped ""robot horse” concept with two seats that riders can steer using body language and AI navigation features. While the promotional video of a CGI simulation shows the Corleo vehicle leaping and moving at high speeds, the current prototype can only stand and pose. Watch our video coverage and learn when this project could become a reality.

Meanwhile, Fiat Professional has introduced the Tris, a three-wheel electric vehicle designed for last-mile delivery with a 55-mile range and the ability to recharge using a standard domestic socket in under 5 hours. The compact commercial vehicle can carry up to 1,190 pounds and comes in three configurations to serve urban logistics needs. Read our article about the last-mile delivery vehicle solution.

More automotive news was that General Motors will make an $888 million investment to update its New York Tonawanda Propulsion facility, supporting production of sixth-generation V-8 engines for SUVs and trucks. The plant will continue producing fifth-generation engines while preparing for the new production beginning in 2027. Head over to this write-up about GM’s venture.

Finally, Subaru has introduced the ""world’s first airbag for cyclists” on its Forester crossover in Japan. The automaker’s new U-shaped external airbag deploys across the hood and up along the A-pillars to protect cyclists and pedestrians in collisions. See how the brand-new safety feature works in this video.

Publicis Groupe has acquired quite an array of influencer marketing assets in the last couple of years, with Captiv8 and Influential among them — and will be showing them off at the Cannes Lions Festival next week with a global influencer campaign that promotes George the lion, a real lion known in wildlife circles.

According to the company, the campaign will demonstrate the “Super Bowl” type of reach that can be achieved with influencer marketing.

The operation launches on June 16, with a joint Instagram post from top wildlife influencers @shandorlarenty (9.3M TikTok, 596K Instagram) and @Pubity (40M Instagram, 17M TikTok), to introduce George the lion.

From there, the activation will expand across Influential and Captiv8’s network of creators, covering 90% of influencers with more than one million followers, and 95% with more than 5000.

The “Lion Tracker” at Influential Beach (the third annual activation the platform has put on at Cannes, and the first under Publicis ownership) will monitor the lion’s growing audience in real time. By the end of the Cannes Lions Festival, he will have reached “big game” reach, according to the holding company.

The campaign includes a playful digital OOH component comparing the cost of a Super Bowl-worthy influencer buy to the cost of a week in Cannes.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index?
An index value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility.
When is the next release of the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index?
The next release of the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is scheduled for 8 a.m.","Summary

S&P Global Inc (SPGI, Financial) released its latest GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index on June 12, 2025, revealing a decline to -0.46 in May from -0.39 in April. This indicates increasing spare capacity across global supply chains, largely due to ongoing tariffs and trade tensions. The report highlights significant regional disparities, with Asia experiencing the most underutilization, while Europe shows signs of industrial recovery. The U.S. manufacturers are front-loading inventories in anticipation of further tariffs, despite underutilization in North American factories.

Positive Aspects

European industrial sector is edging closer to recovery, buoyed by fiscal stimulus measures, particularly in Germany.

Global material supply levels remain robust, with vendors having sufficient stock to meet orders.

Transportation costs are broadly in line with their long-term average, indicating stability in logistics expenses.

Negative Aspects

Asia's supply chains are the most underutilized since December 2023, with significant retrenchment in Chinese factories.

North American supply chains remain underutilized, with persistent weakness in Mexico and Canada.

The U.K. manufacturing industry shows marked weakness, with considerable slack across supply chains.

Financial Analyst Perspective

From a financial analyst's viewpoint, the report underscores the challenges faced by global manufacturers due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs. The underutilization of supply chains, particularly in Asia and North America, suggests potential inefficiencies and cost implications for companies reliant on these regions. However, the proactive inventory strategies in the U.S. could mitigate future risks associated with price hikes and supply disruptions. Investors should monitor these trends closely, as they could impact corporate earnings and supply chain resilience.

Market Research Analyst Perspective

As a market research analyst, the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index provides critical insights into regional supply chain dynamics. The contrasting trends between Europe and Asia highlight the importance of regional strategies in navigating global supply chain challenges. Companies may need to diversify their supplier base and adapt procurement strategies to mitigate risks associated with underutilization and potential supply chain disruptions. The report also suggests that fiscal policies and economic stimuli can play a significant role in regional industrial recovery.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

While Taco Bell has said that Crispy Chicken is coming to permanent menus, this is not that launch.
The Crispy Chicken Strips, taco, and burrito are only joining the lineup for a limited time—but the chain promises more crispy chicken is coming soon.","By now, it’s almost comical to see just how many fast food chains have released their version of a snack wrap before McDonald’s brings its fan-loved offering out of retirement. Despite Mickey D’s setting a date for the iconic Snack Wrap’s return (it’s July 10, FYI), Ronald McDonald’s is still getting beat at his own game.

Popeyes introduced its chicken wraps on June 2 and now even Taco Bell—yes, the Tex-Mex chain—is getting in on the chicken wars 2.0.

One of Taco Bell’s most successful—and maybe most surprising—launches was its Crispy Chicken Nuggets in 2024. The nuggets, made with a tortilla chip-infused breading, quickly sold out, but the chain brought them back again this year with much fanfare.

At Live Más Live 2025, the chain teased that its beloved nuggets wouldn’t be the only crispy chicken option fans see this year. In fact, Taco Bell promised that it would add a crispy chicken offering to its permanent menu by 2026.

As of June 12, we’re one step closer to that goal. After months of testing, Taco Bell is finally bringing its Crispy Chicken Strips, Crispy Chicken Burrito, and Crispy Chicken Taco (aka its version of the Snack Wrap) to menus nationwide.

Taco Bell Debuts Crispy Chicken Strips, Taco, and Burrito

Taco Bell began testing chicken strips a few years ago, then again in March of this year with its Crispy Chicken Bacon Club Burrito. The chain seemed to land on its new Crispy Chicken Tacos and Crispy Chicken Burritos in May when it launched its final market test in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Now, the taco, burrito, and strips themselves are headed to menus across the country.

The star of the launch is the new Crispy Chicken Strips, which are marinated in jalapeño buttermilk flavor and coated with tortilla chip breadcrumbs before being fried. The strips can be ordered on their own or with the new Spicy Ranchero Sauce, made with Anaheim and jalapeño peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and onion, or Avocado Ranch sauce, a mild, creamy ranch sauce with a hint of avocado flavor.

The Crispy Chicken Taco features a Crispy Chicken Strip topped with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo, and shredded Cheddar cheese on a tortilla, served with Spicy Ranchero or Avocado Ranch sauce. Taco Bell’s new Crispy Chicken Burrito is double the size of the taco with two Crispy Chicken Strips, purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo, and Cheddar cheese on a full-sized tortilla with your choice of Spicy Ranchero or Avocado Ranch sauce.

While Taco Bell has said that Crispy Chicken is coming to permanent menus, this is not that launch. The Crispy Chicken Strips, taco, and burrito are only joining the lineup for a limited time—but the chain promises more crispy chicken is coming soon.

Considering that Taco Bell just finished up its market test in North Carolina and the chicken strips are already on the menu, it’s likely that they’ll be as big of a hit as the Crispy Chicken Nuggets. So, you might want to try them soon, in case they sell out as quickly as the nuggets did.",https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/g1yK4djA0aywH2dFKj3oYUiJwhE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AR-Taco-Bell-Batch-Getty-05-2x1-f976f21e0fca4012b4e40bca243884f3.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:32:01.098756

That idea of focusing on stores was echoed in Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, which he unveiled shortly after taking over as CEO.

Schultz was speaking at ""Starbucks Leadership Experience 2025,"" an event which saw over 14,000 North American store managers gather in Las Vegas, when he praised Niccol's work. The former and current CEOs of Starbucks discussed the company's future during a fireside chat on Wednesday.

""I want to say, when I heard you speak for the first time about 'Back to Starbucks,' I did a cartwheel in my living room,"" Schultz told Niccol.

""First of all, it was so brilliant. It's short. It's to the point, and it's exactly the tip of the spear of who we should be, and who we are. And we are, above all else, a coffee company,"" Schultz added.

Starbucks told Business Insider it had no further comments on Schultz's remarks.

Niccol was the CEO of the Mexican grill chain Chipotle before he became the CEO of Starbucks in September.

Niccol's predecessor, Laxman Narasimhan, stepped down after 17 months. During Narasimhan's tenure as CEO, the company struggled with declining sales in the US and China.

Schultz publicly criticized Starbucks' management in a LinkedIn post he wrote in May 2024. Schultz said the coffee chain's senior leaders and board members ""need to spend more time with those who wear the green apron"" and overhaul its retail strategy.

""The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores,"" Schultz wrote on LinkedIn.

That idea of focusing on stores was echoed in Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, which he unveiled shortly after taking over as CEO.

""Today, I'm making a commitment: We're getting back to Starbucks. We're refocusing on what has always set Starbucks apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas,"" Niccol wrote in an open letter in September.

Starbucks announced its second-quarter earnings in April. The company reported $8.8 billion in net revenue, slightly lower than the $8.83 billion estimate compiled by Bloomberg.

Jason Haas CFA has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors influencing Ecolab’s current market position. The company is maintaining its pricing surcharge strategy, which is expected to be realized in the latter half of the year, despite facing a challenging demand environment. This approach is supported by Ecolab’s technological capabilities to demonstrate value to clients, although the company is still contending with rising commodity costs due to supply chain shifts.

While Ecolab is experiencing soft demand in several basic industries, it is making strides in areas like pest elimination and life sciences, which are showing positive momentum. The company is also committed to achieving a 20% operating margin by 2027, driven by innovation and efficiency improvements. Although digital growth is promising, it remains a smaller segment of the business. Consequently, the Hold rating reflects a balanced view of Ecolab’s potential and current market challenges, with a price target maintained at $260.

In another report released yesterday, Evercore ISI also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $265.00 price target.

Based on the recent corporate insider activity of 123 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is negative on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders selling their shares of ECL in relation to earlier this year.

Attachment Japanese Kitchen Appliances Market","Dublin, June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Japan Kitchen Appliances Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2020-2030F"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Japanese Kitchen Appliances Market was valued at USD 8.98 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 12.56 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 5.75%.

Market growth is primarily driven by increasing urbanization and the rise of nuclear households, boosting demand for compact, multifunctional appliances suited to limited living spaces. Consumers are increasingly embracing smart, energy-efficient kitchen solutions featuring IoT integration, automation, and sensor-based technology, enhancing convenience while lowering energy consumption.

Rising disposable income and higher living standards are encouraging investment in premium appliances with advanced capabilities. The trend toward healthier lifestyles is fueling demand for products like air fryers and steam ovens.

Additionally, Japan's aging population is influencing the market, with a growing preference for intuitive, safe-to-use appliances that support independent living. These factors, coupled with technological innovation and a strong focus on sustainability, are reshaping Japan's kitchen appliance sector and driving robust growth across both residential and commercial segments.

Key Market Drivers

Surging Disposable Income & Changing Lifestyles: The growth of disposable income and evolving consumer lifestyles are key forces accelerating the Japan kitchen appliances market. In 2024, the average monthly disposable income for multi-person working households in Japan rose to approximately USD 3.66 thousand - a 2.3% increase year-on-year in real terms. This financial improvement enables consumers to spend more on premium kitchen solutions that offer modern functionality and efficiency.

Urban living has intensified the need for time-saving appliances like smart refrigerators, automated cookers, and microwave ovens. In addition, as consumers adopt healthier eating habits, demand is increasing for appliances like steam ovens and air fryers that support nutritional cooking. The growing preference for connected appliances equipped with IoT also reflects the shift toward smart living. These lifestyle trends are reshaping kitchen spaces and driving innovation, as Japanese households seek convenience, health, and technology integration in their everyday cooking routines.

Key Market Challenges

High Market Saturation: The Japan kitchen appliances market is challenged by high saturation, which limits expansion opportunities and intensifies competition. The market is mature, with strong participation from both local and international players, resulting in intense price wars and narrow profit margins. Japanese consumers are brand-loyal and demand high-quality products, which makes it difficult for newer or smaller entrants to gain traction.

The market's saturation leads to slower sales volume growth and pressures companies to differentiate through innovation and advanced features. However, continuous innovation requires significant R&D investment - something smaller firms may struggle to sustain. Established companies benefit from well-developed supply chains and brand recognition, putting additional strain on emerging players. This competitive environment makes strategic innovation, differentiation, and targeting niche segments essential for sustained success in Japan's kitchen appliance industry.

Key Market Trends

Rising Government Support for Smart Homes: Government initiatives in Japan are playing a pivotal role in shaping the kitchen appliances market, especially through the promotion of smart homes.

Programs like the housing eco-point system incentivize the integration of energy-efficient and intelligent technologies into residential construction and renovation projects. Local governments also offer rebate schemes for energy-saving appliances, reinforcing the demand for eco-friendly solutions. These policies align with Japan's long-term sustainability goals and are encouraging both manufacturers and consumers to prioritize smart kitchen technologies. As a result, appliances equipped with connectivity features, energy optimization, and user-friendly automation are gaining traction.

Government-backed initiatives are not only accelerating adoption but also influencing the direction of product innovation across the kitchen appliance industry.

Highlights

Vietnam is actively seeking support from major American garment companies, including Gap Inc. and Levi Strauss & Co., to mitigate the impact of President Donald Trump's proposed 46 percent trade tariff.

Vietnam's Minister of Industry and Trade, Nguyen Hong Dien, emphasized the country's commitment to being a reliable partner in the global supply chain during meetings with leaders from the American Apparel and Footwear Association and major brands.

The United States was Vietnam's top export market, with exports reaching $57 billion in the first five months of 2025, a significant increase from $44 billion during the same period the previous year.

Vietnam has sought to enlist major US garment companies including Gap and Levi Strauss as it tries to head off President Donald Trump's threatened 46 percent trade tariff.

The country, a major producer of clothing and footwear for international brands, has the third-biggest trade surplus with the United States after China and Mexico, making it a target for Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff blitz in April.

Officials have been locked in talks with their US counterparts to avoid being hit, seeking support from American tech giants and signing agriculture deals with Washington to ease the problem.

On a visit to the United States, Vietnam's minister of industry and trade Nguyen Hong Dien on Monday met leaders from the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) and leading brands Gap, Levi Strauss, and Under Armour.

The United States was Vietnam's number one export market with $57 billion in the first five months of 2025 -- up from $44 billion over the same period a year ago.

Textiles and footwear were among the leading products sent to American clients.

A trade ministry statement posted online late Tuesday said Dien wanted to cement Vietnam's willingness ""to be a reliable partner in the global supply chain"".

""Cooperation with Vietnam will bring long-term strategic benefits and contribute to improving the trade balance in a fair, harmonious and sustainable direction between the two countries,"" he was quoted as saying.

Dien also met Jeffrey Perlman, the head of Warburg Pincus Investment Fund, the statement said.

When announcing his raft of levies in April, Trump claimed Vietnam charged the United States a 90 percent tariff, which was based on Hanoi's trade surplus of $123.5 billion last year.

His administration also appeared particularly angry about what it sees as the Asian nation's role in attempts to get around tariffs imposed on China.

Advt

But given Vietnam's vital role in global supply chains, many parties -- including US companies in the country -- have urged the White House to walk back the tariffs.

Vietnamese and US trade negotiators held their latest round of talks in Paris last week, and are scheduled to meet again in the next few days.

Hanoi last week signed several agreements worth up to $3 billion of agricultural products and other raw materials from the United States as it sought to rebalance their trading partnership.

Trump's real estate group also broke ground last month on a $1.5 billion luxury golf resort in Vietnam, while his son Eric has been scouting locations for a potential tower project in Ho Chi Minh City, the country's southern business hub.

As new data show 4 out of 5 U.S. adults don't feel confident in their knowledge of health insurance benefits, new digital tools use clear, conversational language to boost understanding and help customers get more out of their coverage

BLOOMFIELD, Conn., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cigna Healthcare, the health benefits division of The Cigna Group (CI), is introducing a series of new digital features to improve the customer experience during common health insurance interactions, such as checking benefits coverage, estimating costs and finding care. These enhancements are designed to provide a reliably simple experience for everyday needs and are an important step in delivering on the company's commitment to make health care easier for customers.

""We're committed to making our customers' experiences simpler, seamless and more reliable,"" said Heather Dlugolenski, chief strategy officer, Cigna Healthcare. ""That's why we're creating smarter, more connected digital experiences that anticipate our customers' needs while bringing clarity and compassion to everyday moments.""

The new digital features, which were developed with rigorous research and testing within a comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) governance framework, are being made available in a phased rollout through Cigna Healthcare's myCigna member portal. They include:

AI-Powered Virtual Assistant: More than a chatbot, this industry-first generative AI tool provides clear, conversational and personalized answers to common questions about benefits coverage, claims and care options. If additional assistance is needed, the virtual assistant seamlessly connects customers to a customer service advocate. Early results show that 2 out of 3 customers who had access to the virtual assistant used it proactively, and more than 4 out of 5 found it helpful.

Personalized Provider Matching: This proprietary matching tool gives customers a tailored list of in-network providers and care delivery methods based on their specific health care needs and preferences. The tool will be integrated soon with the AI Virtual Assistant to help customers quickly find relevant care.

Real-Time Cost Tracking: This redesigned tool provides a simple breakdown of deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, and integrated bill payments, helping customers track their costs in real time and estimate costs with providers and specialists before engaging.

Smart Claim Submission: This user-friendly feature enables customers to upload bills they receive from physicians and other providers, such as chiropractors or therapists. The tool reads the bill, auto-fills claim details for easy submission, and provides digital updates using plain language on claim statuses and decisions.

Plan Selection Support: Customers who get their health insurance through their employer can compare prices, search for providers, and estimate their potential health care costs when selecting their benefits plan. This helps customers make more informed plan decisions during the open enrollment period.

Early Access to myCigna for New Customers: Customers new to Cigna Healthcare and those with changes to their benefits plans can sign into the myCigna member portal before their plan effective date so they can better plan their health care needs in advance and add their digital ID card to their Apple or Google wallets or provider portals for less paperwork.

""Everyday moments in health care need to be easier,"" said Katya Andresen, chief digital and analytics officer at The Cigna Group. ""Customers need to be met where they are with experiences that are adapted to their unique needs. While there is still a lot of work to do to simplify health care, these enhancements are a significant step in our journey to transform the experience and put customers at the heart of it.""

Recent research by Cigna Healthcare reveals that only 1 in 5 U.S. adults feel confident in their ability to understand, evaluate and effectively use health care services. The report found that the more a person understands their health insurance, the more effectively they can navigate the health care ecosystem, leading to better health outcomes, fewer financial surprises and higher overall vitality. By offering intuitive, personalized digital tools that use clear, conversational language, Cigna Healthcare aims to help consumers get more value out of their health insurance benefits and navigate the healthcare ecosystem more effectively.

For customers with complex health needs, such as managing a chronic condition or navigating a serious diagnosis, Cigna Healthcare is expanding access to dedicated My Personal Champion advocates. The company is also investing in new centralized agent teams to help customers more quickly resolve administrative needs, including prior authorizations and post-care claims.

The Cigna Group's broader technology strategy has long aimed to transform and improve health care delivery to create a more personalized, seamless and connected health care experience that empowers customers to improve their overall health and vitality. The strategy's flexibility allows the company to adapt and lean into the changing needs and expectations of the millions of people it serves, such as delivering on the commitments it made earlier this year to meaningfully improve the customer experience.

Just one in five survey respondents say their downtime costs decreased despite experiencing a drop in unplanned downtime.
What can organizations do to make the most of their maintenance time and decrease downtime costs?","Maintenance professionals have an incredibly important job: keeping production lines and facilities running, no matter what challenges are thrown at them.

But what do those challenges look like? And how can they be overcome?

MaintainX aims to find out. As part of its State of Industrial Maintenance report, the maintenance and asset management platform recently surveyed 1,320 professionals across the U.S. and Canada with the goal of understanding the obstacles they face in 2025 and beyond.

Cofounder Nick Haase, who recently discussed SOP generation on The Food Engineering Podcast, notes organizations want to move to a predictive maintenance approach, but that’s often easier said than done.

“They’re struggling to break free from firefighting,” Haase writes. “Preventive maintenance is a goal for most teams — 71% say it’s their primary strategy — but reality often falls short. Less than 35% actually spend most of their time on planned tasks. This isn’t laziness or lack of ambition. It’s because their best intentions keep colliding with challenges like aging equipment and talent shortages.”

Specifically, 13% of survey respondents note they spend 60% or more of their time conducting planned maintenance activities. Just over a fifth (22%) say they spend 41-60% of their time on planned maintenance, while 26% spend 21-40% of their time on scheduled maintenance. The majority of surveyed professionals — 32% — say they spend less than 21% of their time on planned maintenance.

Unplanned downtime is a major concern, but MaintainX has good news to report there: 74% of surveyed respondents reported stabilization or a decrease in unplanned downtime over the last year.

However, 31% of survey respondents note their downtime costs had increased, while 49% say their downtime costs remained the same. Just one in five survey respondents say their downtime costs decreased despite experiencing a drop in unplanned downtime. MaintainX points to three main drivers for increasing downtime costs: machine wear and tear, rising costs of parts and shipping, and labor costs.

What can organizations do to make the most of their maintenance time and decrease downtime costs? MaintainX recommends embracing artificial intelligence (AI). For example, AI can help with work order management and scheduling, maintenance cost tracking and optimization, and predicting equipment failures before they happen.

Organizations are already exploring the use of AI in their operations — 14% of survey respondents report evaluating AI options, 7% plan to implement it within the next 12 months and 12% are in pilot program testing. Meanwhile, some manufacturers have more experience with AI, as 15% use AI in specific areas, while 17% use it across multiple maintenance processes.

Those who utilize AI are experiencing benefits. Nearly 40% cite knowledge capture and sharing as the top advantage, but they also point to reduced unexpected equipment failures, improved maintenance scheduling, more efficient work order completion, improved safety compliance and making data-driven decisions as other benefits.

Certainly there are barriers to implementing AI — budget constraints, lack of technical expertise and cybersecurity concerns — but as organizations seek to optimize their maintenance operations, AI appears to be a critical option to consider.",https://www.foodengineeringmag.com/ext/resources/Issues/2025/01-January/From_the_editor_1170x658.png?height=635&t=1736948478&width=1200,N,,2025-06-12 22:30:09.584497

New Delhi: The Indian retail sector is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rise of Agentic AI—a transformative force that moves far beyond basic automation to enable autonomous decision-making and intelligent goal execution. Once confined to experimental tech labs, this advanced form of artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a strategic imperative for forward-thinking retailers in India. Industry leaders are not only witnessing this evolution—they’re actively shaping it, with a focus on driving efficiency, hyper-personalisation, and measurable financial returns.

According to recent data by PwC, Generative AI (GenAI) could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to global GDP by 2030. Within that future, Agentic AI will play a pivotal role, where AI agents collaborate in real-time to automate complex tasks and enhance enterprise decision-making.

From Pilot to Practice: India’s Retailers Embrace Agentic AI

Retail experts across India agree: while Agentic AI is still in its early stages, its potential is vast.

“We’re seeing retailers and other firms build AI labs to explore Agentic AI, which blends human input, data, and IoT to offer real-time, smarter interactions,” said Sharmila Senthilraja of Capgemini in an earlier interaction with IndiaRetailing. “For instance, a consumer can ask an app for the best deals on vegetables, and the system delivers live promotions automatically. It also enhances supply chain and customer interactions, resulting in seamless, informed experiences.”

Several leading retail organisations have already moved beyond AI experimentation into robust deployment.

Vrushali Parab, Marketing Head (GM) at The Belgian Waffle Co., described their digital-first mindset, despite being an offline business: “We use tech across touchpoints—menu digitisation, kiosks, and CRM.”

Anisa Virji, Head of E-commerce at Regal Shoes, spoke of integrating AI in content creation, chatbot-driven customer support, and tools for intelligent customer engagement.

Anwer Alvi, Head – Brands.com at Bestseller, stressed the foundational role of consolidated data: “We’ve integrated 15 years of offline and online data into a unified data lake to enable hyper-personalised customer experiences.”

Rupendra Kumar Nigam, Head of IT at Spykar, echoed this sentiment, citing a “single platform, single data link” for managing all data operations across the business.

Retailers at the Forefront of Advanced AI

Among the more mature deployments is Shoppers Stop, where Shashank Katakwar, Deputy GM – AI, Data & Digital Transformation, laid out a robust roadmap:

“As one of India’s oldest multi-brand retailers, we’ve long leveraged AI, starting with our First Citizen loyalty program. We now operate with a unified data lake and live agentic AI tools in production.”

Their applications include:

AI-generated model shoots

Contextual fashion discovery using LLMs

Multilingual beauty advisors and stylists via chatbot pilots

These efforts directly aim to personalise shopping experiences and accelerate digital transformation.

At Baggit, Divya Gupta, Head of E-commerce, highlighted the cost-efficiency of GenAI: “Our summer campaign used AI-generated models in Rome and Egypt—without real shoots.” She envisions AI as a core operational tool, helping improve margins and reduce waste through smarter inventory management.

Driving Strategic Value: From Efficiency to Revenue Impact

Agentic AI isn’t just about innovation—it’s about outcomes.

Shashank Shetty, Regional Sales Director at Salesforce, emphasised the accessibility of modern AI: “AI is now usable by both business and tech users, thanks to natural language interfaces. The real driver is unified data—that’s what powers the AgentForce layer for enterprise value.”

Himanshu Rajpal, Regional Sales Leader at Salesforce, crystallised the business case, saying, “AI investments must link directly to incremental revenue—that’s where the value becomes undeniable.”

Retailers are making targeted investments to address pain points tied to profitability—inventory optimisation, automation, and productivity—all with tangible ROI goals.

Challenges on the Path: Compute, Security, and Trust

Despite momentum, hurdles remain. Rupendra Nigam cited rising computing costs and unresolved data security concerns: “We’re sharing sensitive data—pricing, supply chain, financials. If breached, the implications are massive, and accountability is still ambiguous.” Still, concerns over internal readiness and cybersecurity persist.

Shashank Katakwar reinforced cloud’s benefits: “With everything on the cloud, infra maintenance and scaling aren’t issues. We analysed a 10–15-minute call for under Rs 1—cost-effective and high on insight.”

AI in Action: Solutions Aligned to Retail Priorities

Indian retailers are laser-focused on high-impact AI applications:

Customer Discovery & Support: Anwer Alvipointed to smarter bots deeply integrated with systems to resolve queries and reduce return rates.

Operational Control & Fraud Detection: Vrushali PParab highlighted fraud detection, while Anisa Virji mentioned RTO intelligence—plugging profit leaks from return-to-origin shipments.

Personalisation & Conversational Commerce: Shoppers Stop’s multilingual voice assistants aim to democratise access and deepen engagement, especially in regional markets.

Integrated Agentic Systems: Bhaskara Kempaiah, Co-Founder of Organic Mandya, described a salon/spa AI system integrated with ERP, CRM, and knowledge bases, capable of seamless, on-the-fly service decisions.

The Road Ahead: From Exploration to Execution

The collective insights are clear: Agentic AI is not a luxury—it’s a strategic necessity. While challenges persist—compute cost, data governance, system integration—the industry’s stance is proactive and optimistic.

The focus is now on:

Building unified data infrastructures

Solving targeted business problems

Ensuring scalable, secure, and cost-efficient deployment

By doing so, Indian retailers are laying the foundation for a new era, where AI doesn’t just support decisions but actively drives them. And in that future, billions in business value await.",https://www.indiaretailing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Agentic-AI-in-Indian-Retail-600-400-e1749722101842.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:21:16.963481

More than 8 out of 10 (86%) defence organisations recognise the need to integrate AI and gen AI in engineering and product development

Paris, June 12 2025 – The Capgemini Research Institute’s latest report, ‘The strategic edge: How digital continuity drives business outcomes in aerospace and defence,’ published today, finds that digital continuity[1] – the seamless integration of data and information across all stages of the product lifecycle and linked to the external partner ecosystem – is emerging as a critical enabler of business transformation in the aerospace and defence (A&D) sector. Over 80% of A&D leaders surveyed view digital continuity as a driver of business transformation and a route to gaining a competitive advantage. In 2024, A&D organisations on average allocated a significant 2.1% of their annual revenue to these initiatives, to ramp up production, accelerate development cycles, reduce operational costs, and stay agile amid global pressures. In the context of rising costs, supply chain instability, and geopolitical movement, investments in digital continuity are expected to increase to 3.4% by 2028.

“Digital continuity is a critical imperative for aerospace and defence organisations to thrive in today’s challenging and uncertain geopolitical environment. If it is embraced as a way of working, it will help organisations increase productivity and free up key resources from the waste created by disconnected systems and data. Ultimately, it enables operational excellence, reduces product development cycle times and fosters a collaborative culture, setting A&D players up for long-term success. Business leaders clearly recognise this and as a result have been ramping up their investments in these initiatives,” said Lee Annecchino, Global Industry Lead, Aerospace and Defence at Capgemini. “In order to leverage the full potential, A&D organisations must focus on building interoperability across systems, enabling robust data management and adopting a comprehensive change management strategy.”

Digital continuity helps A&D organisations to ramp up quickly, driving many business benefits

Nearly nine in 10 (86%) A&D executives agree that digital continuity is important to their organisations’ ramping-up strategies, and 77% believe that improving digital continuity will accelerate the process.

Around a third (34%) of A&D organisations have already reduced costs with 13% cost reduction on average because of digital continuity. Thirty percent of A&D organisations have already realised shortened time to market and 18% have accelerated product development cycle times because of digital continuity, making it a top priority for investment.

Defence organisations are better prepared to ramp up production

According to the survey, 44% of defence organisations are prepared to ramp up production compared to just over a third of civil aerospace organisations. The readiness of defence organisations to ramp up production can be driven by geopolitical uncertainty and technological and infrastructure investment, including a more flexible manufacturing execution system (MES), and a more resilient supply chain. For example, 65% of defence organisations agree that their supply chain is adaptable to quickly changing customer demands, while only 45% of civil aerospace organisations believe the same.

The report also finds that more than 8 out of 10 (86%) defence organisations recognise the need to integrate AI and generative AI in engineering and product development and over half (56%) to develop autonomous systems. However, less than half of the defence organisations are prepared to integrate AI (44%) and only 35% are prepared to develop autonomous systems.

In order to thrive, A&D organisations must continually evolve in terms of skills, processes, technologies, security methods, and compliance policies concludes the report.

Report Methodology

In March 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a global survey to assess the maturity of digital continuity in aerospace and defence (A&D) organisations and the benefits achieved. The survey included 179 A&D organisations across 16 countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East. Over half (51%) of the participating organisations are headquartered in the United States. The survey sample also included 28 public sector or government organisations. All surveyed organisations have annual revenues exceeding $500 million, with the majority (56%) reporting revenues greater than $1 billion.

Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of U.S. tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.
Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 U.S. customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website.
United Parcel Service UPS raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin.
FedEx’s logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by 4% in January, according to a company spokesperson.","U.S. importers are increasingly relying on customs brokers to keep up with President Donald Trump’s ever-changing trade policies. But booming demand for help in processing foreign goods has made these services more expensive, adding another cost to the tariff burden, industry players told Reuters.

Customs brokerages, until recently an anonymous branch of the import ecosystem, handle the paperwork needed to process shipments and calculate tariff bills. Mom-and-pop brokers interviewed by Reuters say they are raising fees, while major logistics firms like Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx FDX and Germany-based DHL DHL are also adding staff to their customs compliance teams.

Market research firms ballpark customs brokering as a roughly $5 billion industry in the United States. Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of U.S. tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.

Independent brokers like Laredo, Texas-based JD Gonzalez are fielding dozens of questions daily from concerned clients struggling to understand what they may owe to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and whether to go ahead with shipments or hold off.

Brokers are also spending more time and labor on customs forms than ever, and have in some cases implemented new IT systems.

“With all the new information we have to process, some of the automation we’ve used has been thrown out, so there’s more work to do,” said JD Gonzalez, who is also president of custom brokerage trade group NCBFAA.

The trend is part of a broader wave of corporate efforts to bolster trade compliance operations. Major companies, from Nike NKE to Amazon AMZN to Lowe’s LOW, had published job postings as of Wednesday for trade and customs professionals.

Nike was seeking a “lead” for trade and customs, who would “play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our trade compliance framework,” according to the post on Nike’s careers website. Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 U.S. customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website. Lowe’s had three.

Nike, Amazon and Lowe’s did not respond to requests for comment.

HIGHER FEES

Independent brokers often base their fees on the number of codes they must enter to classify the contents of a given shipment. Known as harmonized tariff schedule codes, these line items help border officials distinguish car parts from children’s toys, and determine proper tariff rates.

Prior to Trump’s frenetic tariff policies, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code. But Gonzalez said the extra costs brokers have incurred as they ramp up systems to handle the tariff changes have led some to increase fees by $1 to $5 per code.

Gonzalez said he has raised fees “nominally,” while Steve Bozicevic, CEO of A&A Customs Brokers headquartered in Seattle and Vancouver, said his company added $3 per product type being imported into the U.S. because of merchandise facing “tariff stacking,” a phrase used when an item faces multiple tariffs.

“We raised the rates for the U.S. because of the new and added complexity,” Bozicevic said. The company has not raised rates for imports into Canada because there’s “no new complexity,” he said.

United Parcel Service UPS raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin. The move was part of general rate increases and unrelated to changes in tariffs, a UPS spokesperson told Reuters. FedEx’s logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by 4% in January, according to a company spokesperson.

These bigger logistics companies, which include brokerage services in their broader shipping offerings, are also beefing up staff. DHL has upped headcount on its U.S. customs entry team by 30% since February, according to a spokesperson for the company’s DHL Express shipping unit.

FedEx had more than 40 open job postings on its customs and trade teams as of Tuesday, mainly based in the U.S., according to its LinkedIn jobs page. UPS had 10 similar U.S. positions open, according to its jobs website.

FedEx is “adjusting our network to meet demand” in an evolving tariff landscape, which “includes hiring additional customs brokerage roles,” the spokesperson said. UPS declined to comment on the job postings.

Historically, tariff changes have been less frequent, say brokers, trade lawyers and other trade professionals, and they have come with weeks of lead time, allowing brokers to prepare for the change and provide logistical feedback to CBP.

Compare that to last week’s doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, which Trump announced abruptly, forcing the U.S. customs department to quickly publish official guidance just hours ahead of a midnight change.

“Many brokers clear shipments ahead of time, so then you have to come back and retroactively redo it and fix it,” said Miami-based customs broker Ralph De La Rosa, whose company, Imperial Freight Brokers, was founded by his father 54 years ago.

Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.

Importers slowed shipments into the United States after Trump’s massive tariff announcement on April 2, after having frontloaded purchases earlier in the year to get ahead of an expected rise in duties.

Imports of consumer goods, which include cell phones and other household items, decreased $68.9 billion to $277.9 billion in April from a month before, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Trump announced additional tariffs on steel and aluminum in June and in May threatened to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union.",,N,,2025-06-12 22:40:46.869236

Les leaders de l’aéronautique et de la défense font de la continuité numérique une priorité pour faire face aux évolutions du secteur

77 % des dirigeants du secteur estiment que l’amélioration de la continuité numérique accélérera la montée en cadence de la production, avec une réduction moyenne de 13 % du délai de mise sur le marché.

Plus de 8 organisations du secteur de la défense sur 10 (86 %) reconnaissent la nécessité d’intégrer l’Intelligence Artificielle et l’IA générative dans l’ingénierie et le développement produit.

Paris, le 12 juin 2025 – Le dernier rapport du Capgemini Research Institute, intitulé ‘The strategic edge: How digital continuity drives business outcomes in aerospace and defense‘ (L’avantage stratégique : comment la continuité numérique génère des retombées économiques dans l’aéronautique et la défense), révèle que la continuité numérique1 - c’est-à-dire l’intégration fluide des données et des informations tout au long du cycle de vie du produit, y compris avec l’écosystème de partenaires externes - devient un levier essentiel de transformation pour le secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense (A&D). Plus de 80 % des dirigeants interrogés dans cette industrie considèrent la continuité numérique comme un moteur de transformation et un moyen d’obtenir un avantage concurrentiel. En 2024, les organisations de l’industrie de l’aéronautique et de la défense ont en moyenne consacré la part significative de 2,1 % de leur chiffre d’affaires annuel à ces initiatives, afin d’augmenter leur capacité de production, d’accélérer les cycles de développement, de réduire les coûts opérationnels et de rester agiles face aux pressions mondiales. Dans un contexte de hausse des coûts, d’instabilité des chaînes d’approvisionnement et de tensions géopolitiques, ces investissements devraient atteindre 3,4 % d’ici 2028.

« La continuité numérique est une nécessité stratégique pour les organisations de l’aéronautique et de la défense qui souhaitent prospérer dans l’environnement géopolitique actuel, complexe et incertain. Si elle est adoptée comme mode de fonctionnement, elle permet d’accroître la productivité et de préserver des ressources clés des pertes engendrées par des systèmes et des données déconnectés. Enfin, elle favorise l’excellence opérationnelle, réduit les délais de développement des produits et encourage une culture de collaboration, préparant ainsi les acteurs du secteur à une réussite durable. Les dirigeants en sont pleinement conscients et intensifient leurs investissements en ce sens, déclare Lee Annecchino, à la tête du secteur Aéronautique et Défense chez Capgemini. Pour exploiter pleinement ce potentiel, les organisations doivent se concentrer sur l’interopérabilité des systèmes, une gestion robuste des données et une stratégie globale de conduite du changement. »

La continuité numérique permet aux organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense de monter en puissance rapidement, avec de nombreuses retombées économiques à la clé

Près de neuf dirigeants sur dix (86 %) du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense estiment que la continuité numérique est essentielle à leur stratégie de montée en puissance, et 77 % pensent que son amélioration accélérera ce processus.

Environ un tiers (34 %) des organisations du secteur ont déjà réduit leurs coûts grâce à la continuité numérique, avec une baisse moyenne de 13 %. 30 % ont raccourci leur délai de mise sur le marché et 18 % ont accéléré leurs cycles de développement produit, faisant de la continuité numérique une priorité d’investissement.

Les organisations du secteur de la défense sont mieux préparées à augmenter leur production

44 % des organisations du secteur de défense se déclarent prêtes à augmenter leur production, contre un peu plus d’un tiers des organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique civile. Cette avance de l’industrie de la défense s’explique par l’incertitude géopolitique et les investissements technologiques et infrastructurels, notamment dans des systèmes d’exécution de la fabrication (Manufacturing Execution System ou MES) plus flexibles et des chaînes d’approvisionnement plus résilientes. Par exemple, 65 % des organisations du secteur de la défense estiment que leur chaîne d’approvisionnement peut s’adapter à l’évolution des demandes des clients, contre seulement 45 % dans l’aéronautique civile.

Par ailleurs, plus de 8 organisations du secteur de la défense sur 10 (86 %) reconnaissent le besoin d’intégrer l’IA et l’IA générative dans l’ingénierie et le développement produit, et plus de la moitié (56 %) dans le développement de systèmes autonomes. Toutefois, moins de la moitié sont prêtes à intégrer l’IA (44 %) et seulement 35 % à développer des systèmes autonomes.

Pour prospérer, les organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et la défense doivent sans cesse évoluer en matière de compétences, de processus, de technologies, de méthodes de sécurité et de politiques de conformité, conclut le rapport.

Méthodologie du rapport

En mars 2025, le Capgemini Research Institute a conduit une étude à l’échelle mondiale afin d’évaluer le niveau de maturité en matière de continuité numérique dans les organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense (A&D), ainsi que les bénéfices obtenus. L’étude a porté sur 179 organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense réparties dans 16 pays d’Asie-Pacifique, d’Europe, des Amériques et du Moyen-Orient. Le siège social de plus de la moitié (51 %) des organisations répondantes est aux États-Unis. L’échantillon comprenait également 28 organisations du secteur public ou gouvernemental. Toutes les organisations interrogées réalisent un chiffre d’affaires annuel supérieur à 500 millions de dollars, et la majorité d’entre elles (56 %) déclarent un chiffre d’affaires supérieur à un milliard de dollars.

Aerospace and defense leaders are prioritizing digital continuity to

tackle industry disruption

77% of aerospace and defense leaders believe improving digital continuity will accelerate production ramp-up as it drives shorter time to market, with a 13% reduction on average

More than 8 out of 10 (86%) defense organizations recognize the need to integrate AI and gen AI in engineering and product development

Paris, June 12 2025 – The Capgemini Research Institute’s latest report, ‘The strategic edge: How digital continuity drives business outcomes in aerospace and defense,’ published today, finds that digital continuity1 - the seamless integration of data and information across all stages of the product lifecycle and linked to the external partner ecosystem - is emerging as a critical enabler of business transformation in the aerospace and defense (A&D) sector. Over 80% of A&D leaders surveyed view digital continuity as a driver of business transformation and a route to gaining a competitive advantage. In 2024, A&D organizations on average allocated a significant 2.1% of their annual revenue to these initiatives, to ramp up production, accelerate development cycles, reduce operational costs, and stay agile amid global pressures. In the context of rising costs, supply chain instability, and geopolitical movement, investments in digital continuity are expected to increase to 3.4% by 2028.

“Digital continuity is a critical imperative for aerospace and defense organizations to thrive in today’s challenging and uncertain geopolitical environment. If it is embraced as a way of working, it will help organizations increase productivity and free up key resources from the waste created by disconnected systems and data. Ultimately, it enables operational excellence, reduces product development cycle times and fosters a collaborative culture, setting A&D players up for long-term success. Business leaders clearly recognize this and as a result have been ramping up their investments in these initiatives,” said Lee Annecchino, Global Industry Lead, Aerospace and Defense at Capgemini. “In order to leverage the full potential, A&D organizations must focus on building interoperability across systems, enabling robust data management and adopting a comprehensive change management strategy.”

Digital continuity helps A&D organizations to ramp up quickly, driving many business benefits

Nearly nine in 10 (86%) A&D executives agree that digital continuity is important to their organizations’ ramping-up strategies, and 77% believe that improving digital continuity will accelerate the process.

Around a third (34%) of A&D organizations have already reduced costs with 13% cost reduction on average because of digital continuity. Thirty percent of A&D organizations have already realized shortened time to market and 18% have accelerated product development cycle times because of digital continuity, making it a top priority for investment.

Defense organizations are better prepared to ramp up production

According to the survey, 44% of defense organizations are prepared to ramp up production compared to just over a third of civil aerospace organizations. The readiness of defense organizations to ramp up production can be driven by geopolitical uncertainty and technological and infrastructure investment, including a more flexible manufacturing execution system (MES), and a more resilient supply chain. For example, 65% of defense organizations agree that their supply chain is adaptable to quickly changing customer demands, while only 45% of civil aerospace organizations believe the same.

The report also finds that more than 8 out of 10 (86%) defense organizations recognize the need to integrate AI and generative AI in engineering and product development and over half (56%) to develop autonomous systems. However, less than half of the defense organizations are prepared to integrate AI (44%) and only 35% are prepared to develop autonomous systems.

In order to thrive, A&D organizations must continually evolve in terms of skills, processes, technologies, security methods, and compliance policies concludes the report.

Report Methodology

In March 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a global survey to assess the maturity of digital continuity in aerospace and defense (A&D) organizations and the benefits achieved. The survey included 179 A&D organizations across 16 countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East. Over half (51%) of the participating organizations are headquartered in the United States. The survey sample also included 28 public sector or government organizations. All surveyed organizations have annual revenues exceeding $500 million, with the majority (56%) reporting revenues greater than $1 billion.

The group aims to cut CO₂ emissions by 46% by 2030 through a series of concrete actions, like, for instance, developing products that follow a circular approach to reduce water use, chemical treatments, and microplastic dispersion. Along with it, it aims to protect biodiversity and enhance corporate social responsibility through stringent supply chain oversight.

The strategy it will enact will be based on measurable data and integrated actions along its entire value chain.

“As a global company operating across five continents, we feel the responsibility to lead the transition to a more sustainable future,” stated Gianluca Tanzi, chairman and CEO, Chargeurs PCC.

“Our mission is to act as pioneers and game changers in the transformation of the textile industry. We want to continue innovating, providing our customers with solutions that merge excellence and awareness. This is why we are pursuing a series of real and concrete commitments that will involve both our company and our supply chain, addressing environmental concerns, product innovation, and social responsibility,” he added.

To reduce its CO₂ emissions, they have already started taking some initiatives. At the historic Lainière de Picardie site in Péronne, they have restructured operations for greater efficiency, replacing steam systems with hot water, and installing advanced machinery. These changes led to cut 11% of its emissions in 2024 alone. In parallel, since December 2024, the company has engaged its suppliers to map emissions.

The group has also started committing itself to the “Local for Local” model. This approach reflects a long-term vision of responsible, regionally rooted growth. For this, it will develop projects, source materials, and work with suppliers directly within each region to support local economies and reduce environmental impact while building a more agile and transparent supply chain.

Chargeurs PCC is also committed to continuing to advance its sustainable product range. Its Sustainable 360 collection is expanding, offering certified products made from natural, bio-based, and recycled fibers. These materials are designed to reduce water use, chemical treatments, waste, and microplastic dispersion. The company has also confirmed its ongoing efforts to reduce microplastic pollution throughout its product lifecycle.

Recent innovations include some new 100% monomaterial polyester interlinings, enabling easier recycling, and the “Zero Dye Water” interlining range, a selection of lining fabrics dyed without the use of water already available in 19 color variants in France.

This process significantly preserves water and aligns itself with broader environmental goals. In 2024, the company also carried out a water risk assessment at all its production sites using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool, identifying priority areas for further action.

The company is also focused on increasing transparency throughout its supply chain. By 2024, 80% of its suppliers had undergone SMETA audits, with plans underway to extend assessments across the entire chain. It also provides its customers with Transaction Certificates (TCs), ensuring raw material traceability and production integrity.

Chargeurs has also committed to recognizing and avoiding the use of components of the Restricted Substances List (RSL). Its R&D department is developing an internal blacklist of unsustainable components. This voluntary measure that currently has found out that 60% of its products and 90% of it uses substances are already.

The company registered a turnover of €202.8 million in 2024, up five percent on the previous year. Its top three markets are Asia, France, and Italy, with The US brands as the number one market benefiting from manufacturing in Asia.

The company is based in France and boasts a history of over 150 years. It operates through ten production sites, 20 test laboratories, 40 offices and distribution centers, and more than 1,000 employees worldwide.

The company serves more than 7,000 customers in 90 countries on all continents. It also owns the Shirting Division, which offers the excellence of Swiss traditional shirting fabrics.

It is part of Compagnie Chargeurs Invest, a diversified international holding company listed on Euronext Paris.

Prior to the imposition of tariffs, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code.
United Parcel Service raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin.
FedEx's logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by four per cent in January, according to a company spokesperson.
Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.","US importers are increasingly relying on customs brokers to keep up with new trade policies. But booming demand for help in processing foreign goods has made these services more expensive, adding another cost to the tariff burden, industry players told Reuters.

Customs brokerages, until recently an anonymous branch of the import ecosystem, handle the paperwork needed to process shipments and calculate tariff bills. Mom-and-pop brokers interviewed by Reuters say they are raising fees, while major logistics firms like Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx and Germany-based DHL are also adding staff to their customs compliance teams.

Market research firms ballpark customs brokering as a roughly $5 billion industry in the United States. Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of US tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.

Independent brokers like Laredo, Texas-based JD Gonzalez are fielding dozens of questions daily from concerned clients struggling to understand what they may owe to US Customs and Border Protection, and whether to go ahead with shipments or hold off.

Brokers are also spending more time and labor on customs forms than ever, and have in some cases implemented new IT systems.

“With all the new information we have to process, some of the automation we've used has been thrown out, so there’s more work to do,” said JD Gonzalez, who is also president of custom brokerage trade group NCBFAA.

The trend is part of a broader wave of corporate efforts to bolster trade compliance operations. Major companies, from Nike to Amazon to Lowe’s, had published job postings as of Wednesday for trade and customs professionals.

Nike was seeking a “lead” for trade and customs, who would “play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our trade compliance framework,” according to the post on Nike’s careers website. Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 US customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website. Lowe's had three.

Nike, Amazon and Lowe’s did not respond to requests for comment.

Higher fees

Independent brokers often base their fees on the number of codes they must enter to classify the contents of a given shipment. Known as harmonized tariff schedule codes, these line items help border officials distinguish car parts from children's toys, and determine proper tariff rates.

Prior to the imposition of tariffs, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code. But Gonzalez said the extra costs brokers have incurred as they ramp up systems to handle the tariff changes have led some to increase fees by $1 to $5 per code.

Gonzalez said he has raised fees “nominally,” while Steve Bozicevic, CEO of AA Customs Brokers headquartered in Seattle and Vancouver, said his company added $3 per product type being imported into the US because of merchandise facing ""tariff stacking,"" a phrase used when an item faces multiple tariffs.

""We raised the rates for the US because of the new and added complexity,"" Bozicevic said. The company has not raised rates for imports into Canada because there's ""no new complexity,"" he said.

United Parcel Service raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin. The move was part of general rate increases and unrelated to changes in tariffs, a UPS spokesperson told Reuters. FedEx's logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by four per cent in January, according to a company spokesperson.

These bigger logistics companies, which include brokerage services in their broader shipping offerings, are also beefing up staff. DHL has upped headcount on its US customs entry team by 30 per cent since February, according to a spokesperson for the company’s DHL Express shipping unit.

FedEx had more than 40 open job postings on its customs and trade teams as of Tuesday, mainly based in the US, according to its LinkedIn jobs page. UPS had 10 similar US positions open, according to its jobs website.

FedEx is, ""adjusting our network to meet demand,"" in an evolving tariff landscape, which, ""includes hiring additional customs brokerage roles,"" the spokesperson said. UPS declined to comment on the job postings.

Historically, tariff changes have been less frequent, say brokers, trade lawyers and other trade professionals, and they have come with weeks of lead time, allowing brokers to prepare for the change and provide logistical feedback to CBP.

""Many brokers clear shipments ahead of time, so then you have to come back and retroactively redo it and fix it,"" said Miami-based customs broker Ralph De La Rosa, whose company, Imperial Freight Brokers, was founded by his father 54 years ago.

Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.

Importers slowed shipments into the United States after tariffs were announced on April 2, after having frontloaded purchases earlier in the year to get ahead of an expected rise in duties.

Imports of consumer goods, which include cell phones and other household items, decreased $68.9 billion to $277.9 billion in April from a month before, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.

### About Veranda Learning Solutions","Veranda Learning Solutions has grown leaps and bounds through organic and inorganic route over the last few years. It has now initiated a major restructuring exercise under its Veranda 2.0 vision—primarily aimed at unlocking long-term value, enabling focused growth, and sharpening operational agility in the rapidly evolving education sector by carefully studying the synergies between its various businesses and unbundling / re-bundling operations of its 4 key verticals namely, academic, commerce, government test prep and vocational training.

A sub-committee of the Board, primarily consisting of independent directors, has been set up by the Board to study the above with the help of independent consultants and make appropriate recommendations to the Board including merger/demerger of its key verticals.

Veranda’s flagship commerce education brands—JK Shah Classes, BB Virtuals, Navkar Digital Institute, Tapasya College of Commerce, and Logic School of Management have built a formidable presence in the test preparation space for CA, CS, CMA, and ACCA, with over 2000 CA rankers since 2001 and a growing roster of All-India top performers. This vertical, which is led by Prof. J.K. Shah, Founder of JK Shah Classes, would play a critical role in helping drive growth in the years ahead.

The proposed QIP for which the enabling resolution has been approved by the members in the EGM is expected to help provide liquidity, fast track growth, and to ensure that critical business verticals are made debt-free.

Commerce Education: A High-Growth Sector

Veranda 2.0 vision comes amid India’s emergence as a global hub for finance and accounting talent. With over 1,580 Global Capability Centres and 4.32 million B.Com enrolments annually, the demand for certified commerce professionals is rapidly increasing. The company’s commerce education vertical is expected to grow in line with sectoral growth but faster through consolidation of market share from local/regional players driven by Veranda’s preeminent position as the leader in this segment. It is projected to grow revenue from ₹281 crore (pro forma) achieved in FY25 to over ₹1,000 crore by FY30. Student enrolments are also expected to more than double from the present 4.01 lakh in FY25 to over 8 lakhs during the same period.

Given the scope for cross selling across brands, operational efficiencies achieved through economy of scale, offering value-added products across the entire commerce education spectrum, and by expanding the Lifetime Value of each student, the company expects to increase margins from the current 36% in FY25 to over 50% by FY30.

This potential strategic realignment would aim to position Veranda to create distinct verticals which are education powerhouses—each poised for scalable, sustainable, and stakeholder-driven growth.

“The proposed restructuring would be a strategic step toward focused execution and value creation. We are confident in the continued growth and excellence of each one of our key verticals, the commerce vertical being our largest by revenue and profitability,” said Mr. Suresh Kalpathi, Executive Director and Chairman, Veranda Learning Solutions.

The aforementioned eggs were distributed to Walmart, Safeway, chains owned by Kroger and various other independent and chain supermarkets.

Hilmar, California’s August Egg Company, a division of Gemperle Enterprises, produced the eggs and issued the recall Friday.

“August Egg Company is not selling fresh shell eggs at this time,” the company-written, FDA-posted recall notice said. “Our firm has voluntarily been diverting eggs to an egg-breaking plant for over 30 days, which pasteurizes the eggs and kills any potential foodborne pathogens.”

The eggs that went to Walmart stores had sell by dates from March 4 through June 19. Other retailers got eggs with “sell by dates” from March 4 through June 4.

August Egg says these eggs went to stores in California, Washington, Illinois, Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Indiana. The recall section of Walmart’s website says this also involves its stores in Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Wisconsin.

What’s up with the salmonella outbreak?

Saturday’s outbreak update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 79 people have been sickened in this outbreak with 21 hospitalizations. Of those 79, 63 are in California. The remaining 16 break down as Nevada and Washington (four each); Arizona, three; Nebraska and New Jersey (two each); and Kentucky, one.

Salmonella outbreaks tend to be very undercounted because most people recover without medical attention.

What is salmonella?

The CDC estimates about 1.35 million people in the United States will get salmonella each year. Of that number, 26,400 will be hospitalized, usually driven to the hospital by bloody diarrhea, and 420 will die.

Usually, salmonella just means a few days of diarrhea, vomiting, fever and stomachaches.

Specifically, they should pay attention to three structural dynamics that are altering the global landscape: capital flows, demographic shifts, and political ideology, which are ushering in a more fragmented and siloed world.

Changes to capital flows are driven largely by regulatory requirements (such as the US ban on investments in China) and investors’ pursuit of new opportunities for higher returns across sectors and regions. The United States currently represents nearly 70% of stock-market capitalisation worldwide, attracting more than 70% of flows into the $13 trillion global market for private investments, which include equity and credit. This is true despite the recent sell-off. The US stock market is where investors can generate the most attractive returns, because the US is a global innovation leader with broad, liquid, and deep capital markets.

But global debt has reached 237% of world GDP, raising concerns about who owns outstanding liabilities and the extent to which there is hidden leverage in the global financial system. The US government alone owes $36tn (or 124% of GDP) – a large proportion of which is held by China, with which relations are strained.

Moreover, hidden leverage and the shadow banking sector’s debts could become a problem. According to S&P Global, shadow banks held $63tn in financial assets at the end of 2022 – representing 78% of global GDP. And further analysis has also shown that in 2024, shadow banking accounted for 70% of US mortgage origination and leveraged lending. Investors and business leaders will need to ask themselves who holds what debt, and where debt obligations and major pools of financial leverage may lie.

The second big worry concerns demographics. The global population continues to grow at a rapid clip, with the United Nations forecasting that there will 11.2bn people by 2100, up from 8.1bn now. Already, almost 90% of the world’s population lives in poorer emerging markets, and economically poorer regions – such as Africa, India, and the Middle East – are projected to experience population growth at or above the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. Thus, these regions will continue to skew younger. Across Africa, 50-60% of the population is below the age of 25, compared to only 20% across the OECD.

Meanwhile, other countries are ageing rapidly and registering lower birth rates, with forecasts for Europe and China pointing to marked population declines. According to Eurostat, the European Union’s population is projected to peak at 453.3mn in 2026, before gradually decreasing to 419.5mn by 2100. And UN data suggest that China’s population will fall below 800mn by 2100, from 1.4bn now.

Such trends have far-reaching implications for global demand and production across a wide array of commodities such as foodstuffs and energy. For example, India, with its large, poorer population, is still heavily dependent on coal and fossil fuels, as compared to renewables.

Demographic changes will also alter financial portfolios as ageing populations switch from being capitalists (willing to take on risk) to rentiers (desiring stable, predictable fixed incomes). But markets will also have to calibrate for unprecedented intergenerational wealth transfers from baby boomers to millennials. Cerulli Associates estimates that this could amount to $84tn by 2045.

Finally, the ideological splits across countries and regions must be factored in. The breakdown of multilateralism and the fragmentation of trade, capital flows, migration, and ideas are all being priced in, and policymakers and business leaders will have to keep these trends in mind. America’s largest multinationals still generate more than half of their revenues outside the US. But they now need to consider what strained US alliances and traditional trading relationships will mean for their businesses.

For business more broadly, deglobalisation has forced a shift toward more centralised procurement, hiring, and trade in goods and services. It is also jeopardising carry trades (borrowing cheaply in New York and London to invest in higher-yielding regions) and making it harder to repatriate profits.

In the near term, the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations could affect salaries and fuel higher inflation in consumer goods, wages, and prices across sectors. Higher inflation, moreover, will likely drive up the cost of capital, which could suppress business investment. And over the long term, deglobalisation and technological advances – such as AI and quantum computing – will further entrench today’s ideological splits.

Geopolitical fissures have already raised big political questions. There is a tug of war between state capitalism and market capitalism, and over the reconfiguration of alliances and country groupings. New blocs such as the Brics+ are vying for global influence and looking to circumvent traditional multilateral institutions. The Brics+ countries already represent 45% of the world’s population and 35% of its GDP, and they are playing a growing role in the pricing and trade of many internationally traded goods and commodities. Such developments are making it harder for countries to achieve global alignment; even previously celebrated efforts like the United Nations Climate Change Conferences have been hobbled.

As global growth slows, trade, finance, religion, energy, AI, and immigration are all being weaponised, leading to much greater complexity that will make it harder to anticipate policy outcomes. As a practical matter, added complexity and reduced visibility will likely shorten the time horizons for crucial decisions about allocating capital and human resources.

Rather than looking five years ahead – typically assumed to be the length of an economic or business cycle – investors, business leaders, and policymakers may need to think more in terms of the next 18 months. Amid so much volatility, decision-makers will have to focus on adaptability. No one can afford to commit to long-term strategies based on regulatory, geopolitical, or economic conditions that might change overnight. — Project Syndicate

Express Scripts echoed these comments.
However, these tactics are already prohibited in current Arkansas law, Express Scripts argued.
CVS and Express Scripts argue that this law violates the constitution in several ways.
For Express Scripts, the company doesn’t operate brick & mortar pharmacies in Arkansas, but it does have 25 non-resident pharmacy licenses in Arkansas that would be affected by the law.","There have been several recent efforts to crack down on pharmacy benefit managers, from bills in Congress (Opens in a new window) to an investigation (Opens in a new window) by the Federal Trade Commission.

But the state of Arkansas has been the one to actually take definitive action.

In April, Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation (Opens in a new window) that states that starting January 1, 2026, no PBMs can own and operate pharmacies in the state. PBMs have increasingly (Opens in a new window) bought up pharmacies in recent years, which allows them to increase drug prices and put competitors out of business, the governor’s office stated in the announcement.

The law was likely intended to check the influence of the three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx — that cumulatively process 80% of all prescriptions in the U.S. But it should come as no surprise that some of the PBMs are fighting back. Last week, CVS Caremark and Express Scripts filed separate lawsuits challenging the law, arguing that it is unconstitutional, will force pharmacies to close, eliminate hundreds of jobs and actually increase costs.

“With Act 624 signed into law, the Arkansas legislature and governor are forcing 23 community pharmacies to close by January 1, 2026, including some of the very few that are open 24 hours; fire more than 500 local healthcare workers; erode access to specialized pharmacy care for the 10,000 Arkansas patients with serious conditions who rely on additional support; and increase the cost of Arkansas health benefits by millions of dollars each year,” argued Amy Thibault, executive director of corporate communications at CVS Health, in an email.

Express Scripts echoed these comments.

“If this law takes effect in January, hundreds of thousands of Arkansans will be left scrambling to navigate the forced closure of pharmacies and finding new ways to get their medicines and critical clinical support,” said Susan Peppers, RPh, vice president of pharmacy practice at Evernorth Health Services, in a statement.

The decision to sue is just out of fear that they will lose marketshare, said a Sanders spokesperson.

“Governor Sanders is proud that Arkansas is the first state in the nation to hold PBMs accountable for their anticompetitive practices,” Sam Dubke, Sanders’ communications director, told MedCity News in an email. “These big drug middlemen are only attacking Arkansas in the courts because they’re worried other states will join Governor Sanders in fighting for patient access and affordable prescriptions.”

The lawsuits

In their separate lawsuits against Act 624, CVS Health and Express Scripts both argue that the new law is intended to protect in-state pharmacy businesses, which they argue charge higher prices, while punishing out-of-state competitors.

“Act 624’s text, context, and legislative history make abundantly clear that the statute’s purpose and effect is to protect local pharmacies domiciled in Arkansas from out-of-state competition, and to do so by punishing specific out-of-state competitors,” according to Express Scripts’ complaint (Opens in a new window).

The company noted that the purpose of Act 624 is to eliminate certain anticompetitive business tactics. However, these tactics are already prohibited in current Arkansas law, Express Scripts argued. It gave the example of one statute that prohibits PBMs from reimbursing a pharmacy or pharmacist in the state less than what it reimburses an affiliate for the same services.

CVS also noted the same in its complaint (Opens in a new window), and added that it actually reimburses non-affiliated pharmacies at a higher rate than its own pharmacies.

In addition, CVS argued that the law unfairly exempts Walmart, one of Arkansas’ largest employers, which the company said “effectively operates PBM-affiliated pharmacies.” The original draft of the bill would have applied to Walmart, but it “almost died” in committee because of this, the complaint stated. The complaint noted that one senator said he couldn’t vote for the original bill because it would have prevented Walmart from having pharmacies. But the bill’s “architects devised a fix,” CVS charged.

“Notwithstanding the legislature’s putative concern that PBMs act as ‘fox[es] guarding the henhouse’ when they serve as ‘a price setter and price taker,’ HB 1150 was amended to include an exemption for PBM-affiliated pharmacies if the PBM serves only the pharmacy’s own employee benefit plan,” CVS argued in its complaint. “That exemption covers Walmart. So while Walmart could continue to operate its pharmacies, one of its biggest out-of-state competitors—CVS—would be forced to leave Arkansas altogether.”

It’s important to note that Walmart is not a PBM. However, the company provides PBM services, according to CVS. The CVS spokesperson pointed this MedCity News reporter to an article that announced that the Purchaser Business Group on Health, an employer coalition that includes Walmart, launched (Opens in a new window) a firm called EmsanaRx in 2021 that provides PBM services for employers.

CVS noted in the complaint that Walmart has announced plans to expand its pharmacy offerings in Arkansas and has seen an increase in prescription orders since the law.

CVS and Express Scripts argue that this law violates the constitution in several ways. However, according to one healthcare legal expert, their strongest case is on the Dormant Commerce Clause, which says that states cannot pass laws that unfairly hurt or discriminate against businesses from other states. Both CVS and Express Scripts have this same claim. Other than that, they have different arguments for ways this law is unconstitutional, noted Jesse C. Dresser, partner in Frier Levitt’s Life Sciences Department.

In addition, even if the law is justified, it will hurt out-of-state PBM affiliated pharmacies in favor of Arkansas-based pharmacies, which could be viewed as discriminatory, he said.

“That all being said, I do not think that the PBMs’ lawsuit will be successful,” Dresser added. “States have broad authority to regulate pharmacies under the general police powers, and recent cases have shown that the Dormant Commerce Clause does not prohibit all state regulation that affects interstate commerce.”

What could come next?

Like Arkansas, several other states are considering similar efforts, including Vermont and New York. And the results of these lawsuits in Arkansas could spur them into action.

“It may be that once we see how these cases shake out with Express Scripts and CVS, that these other states might pick up the mantle and try to do something similar as well,” Dresser said.

A major reason for why Arkansas was the first state to pass this law could be that it has a smaller concentration of some of these PBM-affiliated pharmacies, meaning it wouldn’t take as big of a hit of pharmacies closing compared to some other states, according to Dresser.

He added that he was surprised when CVS said that it will only have to close 23 pharmacies, expecting the company to have a much bigger presence.

For Express Scripts, the company doesn’t operate brick & mortar pharmacies in Arkansas, but it does have 25 non-resident pharmacy licenses in Arkansas that would be affected by the law. The company would not be able to provide care to 50,000 Arkansans who fill prescriptions or receive in-home nursing care through an Evernorth Pharmacy, which is a subsidiary of Cigna.

Several advocacy organizations have come out in support of Arkansas’ law. This includes the National Community Pharmacists Association, who said the legislation is groundbreaking because it tackles vertical integration itself instead of creating laws to deal with its downstream effects.

“HB 1150 removes many of the bad actors who have massive conflicts of interest, actors who have not complied with – or have found ways to work around – previously enacted laws,” said Joel Kurzman, director of state government affairs at the National Community Pharmacists Association. “The legislation levels the playing field for a more competitive pharmacy environment that is ultimately more friendly to patients.”

NCPA gave the example (Opens in a new window) of an audit by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, which found that Express Scripts reimbursed its owned or affiliated pharmacies at higher rates than those not owned or affiliated by the PBM, which is against the state’s law.

Patients for Affordable Drugs Now echoed the issues around vertical integration.

“Vertical integration allows PBMs to control which drugs are covered and where prescriptions are filled — steering patients toward their own pharmacies, favoring higher-priced drugs that increase their profits, and squeezing out independent pharmacies that many patients, particularly in rural areas, rely on,” said Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs Now.

There are also efforts at the federal level to ban PBMs from owning pharmacies, such as the Patients Before Monopolies Act (Opens in a new window). This was a bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) in December. However, Dresser finds it unlikely that this would be the first significant PBM reform to come at the federal level. Instead, there will probably be legislation that requires more transparency from PBMs first.

Actually, just a hair under 100 million.

This is because, as it turns out, motorists in the US aren’t buying cars anymore.

And it’s probably exactly for the reason you suspect.

DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie

According to S&P Global Mobility, a market trend researcher, the number of passenger cars on the road in the US has fallen below 100 million for the first time since the 1970s.

And that number is still going down.

Between 2020 and 2023, for example, over 27 million cars were sent to the crusher, while new car registrations topped out at just 13 million.

Why? The answer consists of three words: SUVs and trucks.

People aren’t buying passenger cars because they’re buying SUVs and trucks instead.

This is becoming a bit of a catch-22 situation.

As in, people aren’t buying cars because automakers are mostly focusing on SUVs… because people aren’t buying cars…

And it goes on.

The best-selling vehicle in North America last year was an SUV, the Toyota RAV4.

The second best-seller was the Ford F-150, which is a truck.

In fact, you have to go all the way down to number six to find the first sedan, the Toyota Camry.

And then we have vehicles that used to be sedans but are now SUVs.

For example, Ford decided to use the Mustang nameplate for an SUV, the Mach-E, which is actually outselling the ‘normal’ Mustang.

And the list of nameplates that used to be cars that are now SUVs is long, and it includes – among others – the Mitsubishi Eclipse and the Ford Puma.

After all, people want what they want.

And, at least for now, people clearly want SUVs and trucks.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/N7-2.png,N,,2025-06-08 13:03:57.160125

This vessel will be making its maiden visit to a South Asian port, highlighting Vizhinjam’s capabilities in handling Ultra-Large Container Vessels (ULCVs).

The port, developed and operated by Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd, has recently welcomed other icon-class vessels, including MSC Turkiye and MSC Michel Cappellini, further establishing its reputation as a key hub in maritime trade.

The MSC IRINA was launched in March 2023 and embarked on its maiden voyage in April of the same year. It sails under the Liberian flag and is engineered to stack containers up to 26 tiers high, offering unparalleled capacity in container stacking.

Notably, the MSC IRINA surpasses its predecessor, OOCL Spain, by a margin of 150 TEUs.

In alignment with contemporary environmental standards, the vessel is equipped with energy-saving features that contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions by up to 4 per cent, significantly lowering its carbon footprint while maintaining operational efficiency.

The docking of the MSC IRINA at Vizhinjam International Seaport not only underscores the port’s strategic importance in global shipping but also represents a leap forward in sustainable maritime practices, setting a benchmark for future developments in the industry.

On Friday, Nike officially said it had ""agreed to part ways"" with Tame, who was named Australian of The Year in 2021.

The future that Trump envisions, with millions of factory jobs, would have to include immigrants seeking that same opportunity in the United States.
Other companies make some of their fashion lines in the United States, like New Balance and Ralph Lauren.
Until there is enough momentum from companies making things in the United States, the fabric, zippers and buttons will have to be brought into the country.
In the United States, Saitex has spent around $25 million.","HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam – President Donald Trump ignited a global trade war on a gamble that taxing other countries would bring jobs and factories “roaring back” to the United States.

Many business leaders are skeptical. Some are incredulous. Sanjeev Bahl is optimistic.

From his factory in Los Angeles, Bahl oversees around 250 people who sew, cut and distress jeans for brands like Everlane, J. Crew and Ralph Lauren. They stitch together 70,000 pairs of jeans a month. America, he insisted, can make stuff again.

But there is a catch. The operation works only because his company, Saitex, runs a much bigger factory and fabric mill in southern Vietnam where thousands of workers churn out 500,000 pairs of jeans a month.

Trump’s tariffs have upended supply chains, walloped businesses and focused the minds of corporate leaders on one question: Does America have what it takes to bring jobs back?

In many industries, the undertaking would take years, if not decades. The United States lacks nearly every part of the manufacturing ecosystem – the workers, the training, the technology and the government support.

“There are some harsh realities,” said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade group.

And Trump’s strategy is shrouded in uncertainty. Last month, he said, “We’re not looking to make sneakers and T-shirts” in the United States. But his steepest tariffs, set to take effect in July, were directed at countries that make clothes and shoes for sale to Americans. Vietnam, at 46%, was one of the hardest hit.

Those tariffs, intended to push companies to bring factory work home, were deemed illegal by a ruling last week by the U.S. Court of International Trade. That decision was temporarily paused by a different court, giving judges time to evaluate an appeal by the Trump administration. Amid all the legal wrangling, Trump has promised to find other ways to disrupt the rules of trade.

Trump has exposed the difficulties in closing the vast distances, geographical and logistical, between where many products are made and where they are consumed. The gulf was laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic, when strict health policies in Asian countries led to the shutdown of factories. When they reopened, orders had piled up and snarled shipping routes trying to ferry goods across thousands of miles.

For executives like Bahl of Saitex, the turmoil caused by Trump’s trade policies has brought fresh urgency to the challenges of managing global supply chains.

“The extended fear and uncertainty that COVID brought was unforeseen,” Bahl said. “There was nothing that could help us except survival instinct.”

In response, Saitex opened a factory in Los Angeles in 2021. Since Trump announced his intention to impose steep tariffs on Vietnam, Bahl has been thinking about how much more he can make in the United States. He could probably bring about 20% of production to the States, up from 10% today, he said.

He believes Saitex could be a blueprint for other apparel companies: “We could be the catalyst of the hypothesis that manufacturing can be brought back to the United States,” he said. But his experience highlights how hard it would be.

There are no mills in America on the scale of what the industry needs, nor major zipper and button suppliers. The cost of running a factory is high. Then there is the labor problem: There just aren’t enough workers.

American factories are already struggling to fill around 500,000 manufacturing jobs, according to estimates by Wells Fargo economists. They calculate that to get manufacturing as a share of employment back to the 1970s peak that Trump has sometimes called for, new factories would have to open and hire 22 million people. There are currently 7.2 million unemployed people.

Trump’s crackdown on immigration has made things worse.

Factory jobs moved overseas to countries, like Vietnam, that had growing populations and young people looking for jobs to pull themselves out of poverty. The future that Trump envisions, with millions of factory jobs, would have to include immigrants seeking that same opportunity in the United States.

Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, an industry lobby group, said there was a gap between a “romantic notion about manufacturing” and the availability of American workers.

“A lot of people say we should be making more clothing in the U.S., but when you ask them, they don’t want to sit in the factory, nor do they want their kids to sit in the factory,” he said. “The problem is that there aren’t any other people around,” he added.

At Saitex’s Los Angeles factory, most of the workers come from countries like Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.

Some 97% of the clothes and shoes that Americans buy are imported for cost reasons. Companies that make everything in the United States include firms like Federal Prison Industries, also known as Unicor, which employs convicts to make military uniforms for less than minimum wage, Lamar said.

Other companies make some of their fashion lines in the United States, like New Balance and Ralph Lauren. Others are playing around with a model where they make small batches of clothes in the United States to test designs and determine their popularity before commissioning big orders – usually from factories in other countries.

It is hard to make things in great volume in America. For Bahl, it boils down to the cost of a sewing machine operator. In Los Angeles, that person gets paid around $4,000 a month. In Vietnam, it is $500.

In Saitex’s factory there, which Bahl set up in 2012 in Dong Nai province, an hour’s drive from Ho Chi Minh City, more than a dozen sewing lines are neatly laid out and humming six days a week.

On a recent day, hundreds of workers pushed panels of jeans through sewing machines so quickly that the fabrics, briefly suspended in the air, looked as though they were flying. The work was augmented by sophisticated machines that can stitch labels onto a dozen shirts at a time, or laser a distressed pattern onto multiple jeans. Nearby, at a spray carousel, a robot mimicked the precise movements of a worker spraying denim.

“The speed is much higher in Vietnam,” said Gilles Cousin, a plant manager overseeing the sewing section.

If Trump really wants to bring jobs back, Bahl said, he should give some tariff exemptions to companies like Saitex that are doing more in the United States. American factories like his can’t expand without importing many of the things that go into their finished products. For its part, Saitex ships bales of American cotton to Vietnam, where its two-story mill turns fluffy cotton lint into thread and, eventually, rolls of fabric. That fabric is then dyed and shipped back the United States for his Los Angeles factory.

Until there is enough momentum from companies making things in the United States, the fabric, zippers and buttons will have to be brought into the country.

Moving production from overseas would require huge investments, too. Saitex has plowed around $150 million into Vietnam, where its factory recycles 98% of its water, air dries its denim and uses technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and cut down on labor-intensive practices. In the United States, Saitex has spent around $25 million. These are long-term commitments that take at least seven years to recover, according to Bahl.

Ultimately, if Trump decided to stick to his original 46% tariff on Vietnam and Saitex could not soften the financial blow, it would have to look to other markets to sell the products it made in Vietnam – like Europe, where it sends about half of what it makes.

“But then,” Bahl said from Los Angeles, “what happens to our factory here?”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/ycbf7H1H5ni5cNvIj-BHD7RIPtE=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/06/05/6840748fb1ea6.hires.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 13:03:42.746554

Key Factors Affecting the Global Trade in 2025

China v/s European Union: The European Union has strengthened subsidy laws on Chinese exports, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs). China is acting with tariff increments on European luxury goods.

U.S. China Trade and Commerce War 2.0: The U.S. continues to force penalties and sanctions on Chinese technology corporations, while China is creating its own supply chains to counteract reliance on the west.

India’s Protectionist Policies: India is increasing import tariffs on electronics and manufacturing components to promote Make in India initiative, while affecting global brands that rely on Indian manufacturing sector.

Penalties on Russia and Middle East: West have imposed sanctions on Russia, forcing global energy and utilities markets to diversify oil and gas suppliers. Further, the MEA remains volatile, affecting shipping routes, such as Suez Canal.

Impact of Digital Trade and Technology

Adoption of Blockchain: Organizations utilize blockchain-powered trade documents to meet regulatory constraints across multiple authorities.

AI & Predictive Analytics in Global Supply Chains: AI enables businesses of all sizes to predict trade disruptions and optimize tracking strategies.

Globalization of digital platforms: E-commerce platforms such as Flipkart, Alibaba, and Amazon are making it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to enter new international markets.

Central Bank Digital Currencies: Governments of several countries are assessing their own digital currencies and cryptocurrencies to boost-up their cross-border commerce and transactions, to reduce dependence on conventional banking systems.

Policy Divergence and Rising Trade Frictions

Policy Separation: Several countries are pursuing different policies, such as the US shifting trade away from China and toward other economies, and the EU moving away from trade with Russia. This is also happening with China using inducement policies to maintain export momentum.

Shifting Trade Relationships: Trade relationships are being reconfigured, with the U.S. and EU shifting trade away from traditional partners and towards other economies. In early April, Trump administration imposed new tariffs, including 10% global tariffs and upto 50% duty on 57 countries. The European Union and China are preparing retaliation, while Canada and Mexico have secured partial exemptions under United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Market Navigate Turbulence

The U.S. stock market experienced a significant volatility with regards to tariff announcements. In response to this, major indexes, such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones saw substantial declines. The S&P 500 fell more than 9.5% on April 9, 2025. Businesses are encouraged to adopt a resilience mindset, develop risk mitigation strategies, and be adaptable to constant changes in the global environment. Further, businesses are diversifying their supply chains and exploring alternative trade routes to reduce reliance on single sources and regions.

Moreover, the increase in gold prices has been one of the remarkable financial developments in early 2025. Gold has reached record levels due to growing geopolitical uncertainty and the apprehensions of the investors regarding inflationary pressures from tariffs. Since 2022, gold’s price movements have become less tied to US interest rates and the US Dollar. This shift is primarily due to two factors: central banks significantly increasing their gold acquisitions and a rise in investment demand for gold from emerging markets. A major contributor to gold’s upward trend is the altered pattern of central bank gold purchases. From 2022 onwards, central banks have effectively doubled their annual gold buying, surpassing 1,000 tons each year, with a notable 1,045 tons acquired in 2024 alone.

The investment demand from emerging markets has grown significantly. In China, a struggling property sector has prompted investors to seek refuge in gold. Meanwhile, in Turkey, there’s been a significant uptick in gold demand as households turn to the precious metal to protect their wealth from rapid currency depreciation. In India, government reductions in import duties have further stimulated gold purchases.

Even with market fluctuations, credit markets are stable. Corporate bond risk premiums have risen slightly, but investors generally don’t expect a severe recession. Emerging markets have struggled, especially those reliant on global trade and vulnerable to a strong dollar. However, commodity exporters, like those in the Gulf and parts of Africa, have done well due to high resource prices and investors seeking value.

Conclusion

Even though inflation is easing and some areas are still experiencing growth, increasing trade disputes and geopolitical instability are rapidly altering the risk landscape. Conventional economic models might not fully account for the effects of sudden policy changes, particularly regarding tariffs and capital flows. As the global economic environment becomes more precarious, it will be crucial to grasp cross-border economic dynamics and modify predictions and investments accordingly.",https://i0.wp.com/www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_2255577621-1-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1205&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-08 13:04:02.108284

Why it matters: Musk's grievances against the president's signature tax-and-spending package have been echoed by some GOP fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill.

Senators last week strategized with Trump and other administration officials on how to cut spending further than the House-passed legislation did.

Driving the news: Johnson said on ABC's ""This Week"" that he hasn't spoken to Musk on the phone since Monday of last week, before the Trump-Musk alliance publicly exploded on Thursday.

""We were disappointed, surprised,"" Johnson said. ""I'd had a lot of great interaction, discussion with him about the one big, beautiful bill to make sure he had accurate information because I was concerned that people were telling him things that just simply weren't true.""

Musk on Thursday posted that he never saw the bill, denying Trump's claim that he was familiar with the inner workings of the legislation.

Johnson told ABC's Jon Karl that Musk had expressed in text messages that his primary concern was about spending in the legislation.

He added that there have been ""almost no calls"" to GOP lawmakers' offices, despite Musk urging his 220 million followers to call their representatives over the bill.

What he's saying: ""I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world,"" Johnson said. ""What we're trying to do is help hard-working Americans who are trying to provide for their families and make ends meet.""

Johnson declined to elaborate on Trump's threat to cut Musk's government contracts.

""What I'm trying to do is make sure that all of this gets resolved quickly,"" he said. ""That we get the one big, beautiful bill done and then hopefully these two titans can reconcile.""

Zoom out: But Trump, in a phone interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker, said he had no desire to mend his relationship with Musk following the explosive falling out.

Trump also told NBC on Saturday that there would be ""serious consequences"" if Musk started funding Democratic candidates.

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) sidestepped Trump's comment when asked about it on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, saying, ""We have a lot of social media drama going on between two of the most active social media individuals in the world ... back and forth on that. And I know a lot of people are focused on that.""

Friction point: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Trump has not spoken to Musk since the spat and that she doesn't believe he intends to.

""We were all hoping for the best for Elon,"" she said. ""And I think it's unfortunate that now that he's gone back to his companies, he is lambasting this bill that he was very much supportive of by all accounts.""

The CRTC imposes different rules on Canadian content contributions from traditional media players.
It argued streamers have contributed to the funding crisis facing local news.
The court hearing comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have cast a shadow over the CRTC’s attempts to regulate online streamers.
Then, as the CRTC launched its hearing on modernizing the definition of Canadian content in May, Netflix, Paramount and Apple cancelled their individual appearances.","Some of the world’s biggest streaming companies will argue in court on Monday that they shouldn’t have to make CRTC-ordered financial contributions to Canadian content and news.

The companies are fighting an order from the federal broadcast regulator that says they must pay five per cent of their annual Canadian revenues to funds devoted to producing Canadian content, including local TV news.

The case, which consolidates several appeals by streamers, will be heard by the Federal Court of Appeal in Toronto.

Apple, Amazon and Spotify are fighting the CRTC’s 2024 order. Motion Picture Association-Canada, which represents such companies as Netflix and Paramount, is challenging a section of the CRTC's order requiring them to contribute to local news.

In December, the court put a pause on the payments — estimated to be at least $1.25 million annually per company. Amazon, Apple and Spotify had argued that if they made the payments and then won the appeal and overturned the CRTC order, they wouldn’t be able to recover the money.

In court documents, the streamers put forward a long list of arguments on why they shouldn’t have to pay, including technical points regarding the CRTC’s powers under the Broadcasting Act.

Spotify argued that the contribution requirement amounts to a tax, which the CRTC doesn’t have the authority to impose. The music streamer also took issue with the CRTC requiring the payments without first deciding how it will define Canadian content.

Amazon argued the federal cabinet specified the CRTC’s requirements have to be ""equitable.""

It said the contribution requirement is ""inequitable because it applies only to foreign online undertakings and only to such undertakings with more than $25 million in annual Canadian broadcasting revenues.""

Apple also said the regulator ""acted prematurely"" and argued the CRTC didn’t consider whether the order was ""equitable."" It pointed out Apple is required to contribute five per cent, while radio stations must only pay 0.5 per cent — and streamers don’t have the same access to the funds into which they pay.

The CRTC imposes different rules on Canadian content contributions from traditional media players. It requires large English-language broadcasters to contribute 30 per cent of revenues to Canadian programming.

Motion Picture Association—Canada is only challenging one aspect of the CRTC’s order — the part requiring companies to contribute 1.5 per cent of revenues to a fund for local news on independent TV stations.

It said in court documents that none of the streamers ""has any connection to news production"" and argued the CRTC doesn’t have the authority to require them to fund news.

""What the CRTC did, erroneously, is purport to justify the … contribution simply on the basis that local news is important and local news operations provided by independent television stations are short of money,"" it said.

""That is a reason why news should be funded by someone, but is devoid of any analysis, legal or factual, as to why it is equitable for foreign online undertakings to fund Canadian news production.""

In its response, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters said the CRTC has wide authority under the Broadcasting Act. It argued streamers have contributed to the funding crisis facing local news.

""While the industry was once dominated by traditional television and radio services, those services are now in decline, as Canadians increasingly turn to online streaming services,"" the broadcasters said.

""For decades, traditional broadcasting undertakings have supported the production of Canadian content through a complex array of CRTC-directed measures … By contrast, online undertakings have not been required to provide any financial support to the Canadian broadcasting system, despite operating here for well over a decade.""

A submission from the federal government in defence of the CRTC argued the regulator was within its rights to order the payments.

""The orders challenged in these proceedings … are a valid exercise of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission’s regulatory powers. These orders seek to remedy the inequity that has resulted from the ascendance of online streaming giants like the Appellants,"" the office of the attorney general said.

""Online undertakings have greatly profited from their access to Canadian audiences, without any corresponding obligation to make meaningful contributions supporting Canadian programming and creators — an obligation that has long been imposed on traditional domestic broadcasters.""

The government said that if the streamers get their way, that would preserve ""an inequitable circumstance in which domestic broadcasters — operating in an industry under economic strain — shoulder a disproportionate regulatory burden.""

""This result would be plainly out of step with the policy aims of Parliament"" and cabinet, it added.

The court hearing comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have cast a shadow over the CRTC’s attempts to regulate online streamers.

The regulator launched a suite of proceedings and hearings as part of its implementation of the Online Streaming Act, legislation that in 2023 updated the Broadcasting Act to set up the CRTC to regulate streaming companies.

In January, as U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term, groups representing U.S. businesses and big tech companies warned the CRTC that its efforts to modernize Canadian content rules could worsen trade relations and lead to retaliation.

Then, as the CRTC launched its hearing on modernizing the definition of Canadian content in May, Netflix, Paramount and Apple cancelled their individual appearances.

While the companies didn’t provide a reason, the move came shortly after Trump threatened to impose a tariff of up to 100 per cent on movies made outside the United States. Foreign streamers have long pointed to their existing spending in Canada in response to calls to bring them into the regulated system.

Wells Fargo (WFC) spent years worried about the past. Now it can focus on the future.

The fourth-largest US bank plans to pursue growth and expansion in investment banking, credit cards, and wealth management now that it has shed a major growth restriction imposed last decade by regulators as punishment for a fake accounts scandal that roiled the San Francisco-based financial institution.

""Now I can start having more fun,"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a Wall Street Journal interview this past week.

The lifting of a $1.95 trillion asset cap will help Scharf go on the offensive as he tries to make Wells Fargo into a major Wall Street investment banking player, edging deeper into a hypercompetitive business where it lags behind Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS).

In fact, Scharf told the Wall Street Journal he wants Wells Fargo to be one of the top five investment banks, and ""then there'll be an argument about, 'Well, why top five? Why not four or three?'""

On Main Street, Wells Fargo also wants to play catch-up after missing out on major opportunities to lap up deposits during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 regional banking turmoil. It also wants to add more credit card products and better integrate its wealth management with its retail branches.

Its growing pains under the asset cap have for years put Wells Fargo at an increasing disadvantage behind larger rivals — ""the gift that keeps giving"" for competitors, Piper Sandler bank analyst Scott Siefers told Yahoo Finance.

Growing its US consumer bank is where the ""heavy lifting"" is needed to move Wells Fargo's stock higher, TD Securities analyst Steven Alexopoulos added in a note this past week. The consumer business pulls in almost half of the bank's revenue.

Still, ""igniting growth in this area is far from a layup,"" Alexopoulos added.

Even after passing its crucial milestone, Wells Fargo's stock didn't soar, ending up 2% this past week. But it is up 30% for the past 12 months, ahead of rivals Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) while lagging JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.

""We didn't change any EPS estimates ... but now and over time I think they are in a growth mode, and ideally market share gain mode,"" Piper Sandler's Siefers said.

One place Wall Street expects Wells Fargo to more quickly show improvement over the near term is its spending on risk and compliance costs.

For years, the bank has funneled millions into ramping up those operations to meet regulators' expectations. Now that Wells Fargo's growth restrictions have been removed, analysts hope a lot of the extra spending will be plowed back into growing the bank.

To catch up with bigger rivals JPMorgan and Bank of America, that will mean investing some compliance cost savings into its brick-and-mortar branch network, stocking those buildings with investment advisers, and spending more on marketing efforts for its credit cards.

Perhaps the most significant thing for Wells Fargo this week is that its overseers have signaled ""a clean bill of health,"" according to Siefers.

""The bank can no longer be pointed to as the sick child of the industry, and I think all this time with that regulatory scrutiny and restriction has probably also left it as the cleanest big bank in the country.""

On Friday, S&P Global upgraded its outlook on Wells Fargo to ""positive"" from ""stable"" and said it expects Wells to expand its commercial and investment banking business — ""the unit most affected by the asset cap and one that had to turn away some nonoperational deposits from customers.""

The milestone for Wells this week drew praise from one of the bank's rivals, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Scharf's former boss earlier in his career.

""Charlie and his team worked extremely hard to resolve these heritage issues, which is good for the entire banking system,"" Dimon said in emailed comments.

Even Dimon has acknowledged that he expects Wells Fargo to be a much more formidable competitor going forward. Not that it will be easy.

""The bank has changed a lot, and yes, they're going to grow. They may see assets grow, but all the banks are going to see assets grow,"" Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance.

McDonald’s seems to have found the perfect balance between innovation and nostalgia. Although its new move started outside the United States, everything suggests that its impact will soon cross the border.

The chain has once again bet on a strategy that marked generations: the McDonaldland characters. From the return of the popular Grimace to new flavors on its menus, the company is creating a wave of excitement. The most recent launch has captured everyone's attention and threatens to overshadow the competition, including Burger King.

The power of nostalgia returns to the menu

During the 1970s, McDonald’s won over the youngest customers with its own universe full of characters. Ronald McDonald, the Hamburglar, Birdie, or Grimace were part of a marketing strategy that could be seen everywhere: toys, ads, and special menus. However, in the 2000s, this line was set aside to focus on a more adult audience.

Recently, the brand has decided to revive that childlike spirit with some occasional appearances. In 2023, Grimace returned to ads and his birthday was celebrated with a purple shake that went viral. Even his Irish uncle, O’Grimacey, made a brief comeback with the classic Shamrock Shake, available for a limited time.

Now, in a new attempt to emotionally reconnect with customers, McDonald’s has introduced a proposal that not only awakens the appetite but also memories. A sugary drink that brings back summer fairs, prizes won at raffles, and that feeling of a happy childhood, according to The Street.

A Canadian bet that could reach the US

The big news is called Cotton Candy Shake: a cotton candy shake mixed with vanilla ice cream. McDonald’s announced it after several days of hints on social media, fueling their followers' expectations. Its flavor aims to take you straight back to childhood summers, according to the company itself.

For now, this new drink can only be enjoyed in Canada, which has left American consumers wanting more. It's not unusual for McDonald’s to adapt its menu according to the country, taking advantage of available ingredients or regional tastes. However, when a product succeeds, they don't take long to replicate it elsewhere.

Although there is no official confirmation about its arrival in the United States, the success in Canada could be decisive. If the ingredients and interest are kept, this shake could be the next big summer sensation in the US. If that happens, Burger King will have to work twice as hard to keep up in the competition.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-restaurante-mcdonalds-burger-king-emoji-preocupado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-06-08 12:11:21.207652

The findings, featured in Russia’s leading business publication Vedomosti, reveal that Turkish firms have not only maintained their operations in the face of sweeping Western sanctions but, in many cases, have expanded them.

Ant Yapi tops the list with landmark projects

Ant Yapi, a Turkish international contractor, stands as the leading Turkish investor in Russia, with total assets valued at 35 billion rubles (approximately $440 million).

Ranked among the world’s top 100 construction companies, Ant Yapi is also active in the United States and the United Kingdom. The firm has left a significant mark on Moscow’s skyline through several major high-rise developments.

Hayat Holding follows with major new facility launch

Second on the list is Hayat Holding, a Turkish manufacturer of hygiene and personal care products, which recently launched a new facility. The group’s investments in Russia now exceed 24.5 billion rubles ($300 million).

Hayat Holding’s operations span paper production and consumer goods manufacturing—areas in which Turkish companies have increasingly stepped in to meet local demand following the exit of Western brands.

Koc Holding maintains diverse operations worth $250 million

Koc Holding, Türkiye's largest conglomerate, ranks 3rd among Turkish investors, with assets totaling 20 billion rubles ($250 million).

Through subsidiaries such as home appliance manufacturer Arcelik, the group has continued to operate and grow in the home appliance and automotive parts sectors. Its acquisition of U.S.-based home appliances firm Whirlpool’s local assets, following the American company’s withdrawal, has further solidified its standing.

Geographic reach extends across major Russian regions

The report also highlights the regional distribution of Turkish investments, which have penetrated various parts of Russia. In Moscow alone, Turkish firms have invested roughly $450 million. Other significant investment hubs include Kaluga ($300 million), Lipetsk ($280 million), and Bashkortostan ($250 million), suggesting a well-diversified portfolio across both industrial centers and emerging markets.

Anadolu Efes asset remains under seizure

Despite the overall continuity of Turkish business activity in Russia, Anadolu Efes—one of Türkiye’s largest investors in the country—has faced state intervention. Since December, its joint venture, AB InBev Efes, has been placed under trusteeship.

The venture, established in 2018 with Belgian multinational AB InBev, had held a 29% share of the Russian beer market.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting increase in business risk for Western firms, Anadolu Efes and AB InBev had agreed to dissolve the partnership.

Under the agreement, Anadolu Efes would acquire 100% of the Russian operations, while AB InBev would take full control of the Ukrainian business.

The two companies had submitted the proposed transfer for regulatory approval in Russia, but, instead of receiving a response, they faced the seizure of the joint venture.

The seizure marked the first such action against a firm from a country classified by Russia as “friendly.”

Strategic sectors remain central to Turkish investment

Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, a record number of over 12,000 international sanctions were imposed against Moscow by the United States, the European Union, and their allies.

In response, many Western multinationals—including globally recognized corporations—either exited the Russian market or transferred their local assets. This vacuum, the report suggests, has allowed companies from Türkiye, China, and Iran to expand their footprint.

“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas.
However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.
“They care about power.” Gas plants for data centers Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers.
Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity.","Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it.

The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road.

“It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.”

The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this build out promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come.

The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.”

Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar, and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability.

“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.”

IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said.

There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totaling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies.

Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply.

Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today.

Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation.

Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand.

This build-out promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records.

Texas, with 9 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state.

GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.

For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand.

“The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.”

It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers.

Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate.

It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook.

“If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said.

The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March.

About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference.

“Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.”

Gas plants for data centers

Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity.

Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940.

“Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.”

CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart.

Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 MW from the grid.

Altogether, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global.

“There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.”

However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals.

Restrictions on renewable energy

Looking forward to a build out of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer.

Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power.

“It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.”

While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry.

One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating.

When the legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund.

Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas, or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass.

Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state.

Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue.

More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income.

He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables.

“I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/data-center-protest.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-08 11:01:47.198705

It was a disruptor of sorts, as most of its locations are drive-thru only.

It's a model that has been copied heavily by growing rivals like 7 Brews, but at the time it was a stripped-down, back-to-basics model.

The company literally began as cart way back in 1992, before the chain began franchising in 2000. It was a slow climb to becoming a real player, but it has steadily grown, reaching a milestone earlier this year.

""On February 7, we opened shop number 1,000 in Orlando, Florida, 33 years after our founding and 3,000 miles from our original push cart in Grants Pass, Oregon. With a long runway ahead and conviction in our brand, we aim to open the next 1,000 new shops with the goal of 2,029 total shops in 2029,"" said CEO Christine Barone during the Dutch Bros. first-quarter earnings call.

She is quite confident the company will reach that goal.

""We see a long-term opportunity to drive sustainable transaction growth by addressing structural barriers, bringing in new customers, enhancing frequency with existing customers and sustaining ongoing momentum in the productivity of our newer shops,"" she added.

Dutch Bros.' growth is about more than drinks

When you look at the Dutch Bros. menu, it's almost entirely drinks. The chain has expanded beyond coffee into smoothies, lemonades, iced teas, sodas, and more.

It also offers a very limited snack menu consisting mostly of muffin tops.

The chain does, however, see a growth opportunity in food. Barone spoke about that as well.

""We see a clear path forward with Order Ahead, throughput and food,"" she said.

The coffee chain has been testing a small breakfast menu in a handful of locations.

""We are thrilled with the success of our limited food test launched late last year and are excited to continue testing and refining this initiative throughout 2025,"" she added.

The hot breakfast menu includes four smaller-sized items: a sausage, egg, and cheddar slider; bacon, egg, and cheddar slider; chorizo wrap; and a maple waffle, according to Nation's Restaurant News.

The test will be expanded to more locations this year.

Dutch Bros. has a clear plan

The coffee chain has taken a ""move slowly"" approach to growth. It's going to continue to do that.

""Building on the success we are having with our Order Ahead initiative, we believe food can generate incrementality in the morning day part and drive frequency. Our approach to this test is both strategic and deliberate. We recognize the potential multi-year growth opportunity with our current food mix at less than 2% of sales,"" Barone said.

Dutch Bros. has also remained focused on making sure it keeps its workers happy.

""Our goals for this test are clear: maintain existing high levels of barista job satisfaction, continue to support throughput efficiency, minimize complexity, and offer a targeted assortment that allows us to satisfy our customers' craving for food while capturing incremental beverage opportunities,"" she added.

Barone made it clear exactly how the company decided what it adds to its menus.

""The pilot test has informed our decision to now offer eight SKUs, including four hot food offerings. With the completion of an initial pilot, we recently expanded this initiative from eight to 32 shops,"" she shared.

That's only the beginning, as Dutch Bros. sees adding breakfast as a massive opportunity.

""Looking ahead, expanding the food test pilot is a crucial step towards a broader test and rollout anticipated to occur throughout 2026.

Nike, JPMorgan, Constellation Brands and Akamai Technologies have different explanations for why their sustainability reports haven’t been published this year.","IT WAS just over a year ago when Nike’s then CEO, John Donahoe, trumpeted a flashy 90-second video, hyping a report about the company’s efforts to improve diversity and equality.

The report, he said in a LinkedIn post, is “a testament to our belief in the transformative power of sport”. Nike had released some version of it since at least 2001, often with similar fanfare.

But this year, the company won’t publish that report.

Nike joins a growing list of companies that includes JPMorgan Chase, Constellation Brands and Akamai Technologies that are either cancelling or delaying publication of their so-called sustainability or corporate impact reports for shareholders. While companies aren’t legally obliged to disclose such information, most S&P 500 members did so in 2024.

For more than a decade, this is usually the time period when companies tout the steps they’re taking to lower carbon emissions and improve the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) of their businesses.

Opposition to these reports first surfaced about three years ago when GOP lawmakers and activists began pressing companies to scale back such efforts. And some companies have reacted by taking steps such as scrubbing ESG (environmental, social and governance) and DEI-related words from public documents.

Anti-DEI movement

The election of President Donald Trump has further empowered the anti-DEI movement. During his first week in the White House, he signed executive orders ending federal diversity programs and restricting gender definition to two sexes – male and female. None of the companies contacted said Trump’s actions changed their planning for releasing sustainability reports.

“The consequences of reported information are much greater now than they were a decade ago,” said Martin Whittaker, chief executive officer of Just Capital, noting that both progressive and conservative activists are searching for evidence of companies’ missteps.

He estimates that about 25 per cent of sustainability-related corporate reporting is behind schedule this year.

Here are some of the S&P 500 companies that have yet to publish sustainability reports, according to researchers at DiversIQ.

Nike, JPMorgan, Constellation Brands and Akamai Technologies have different explanations for why their sustainability reports haven’t been published this year.

Nike said in an e-mail that it still plans to share the work it’s doing to create a more inclusive and sustainable world for athletes in other formats and that its commitment to diversity goals for 2025 hasn’t changed.

In a regulatory filing, JPMorgan said it plans to release a consolidated report on ESG and climate topics later this year. However, the bank added that it will “monitor the evolving disclosure landscape as we iterate on our approach to disclosure”. JPMorgan published its “2024 Climate Report” in November.

At Constellation Brands, a spokesperson said the timing of the publication’s release was adjusted after receiving “stakeholder feedback”, and that the next report is scheduled to be issued next month. Cloud computing and cybersecurity company Akamai said its data-centre vendors were partly to blame for a delay in publication until the end of this quarter. The company wasn’t more specific.

For the past several years, Pfizer had published an impact report by April. When contacted last week about the delay in publication, a company spokesperson said the timing was adjusted to “allow for necessary internal processes in preparation for evolving global ESG reporting requirements”. The company released its report this week.

The lack of information is a blow, even if temporary, to corporate transparency. Many shareholders rely on the disclosures to gauge how serious companies are about addressing ESG issues, inequities in the workforce, and other factors that can impact the short and long-term value of their investments.

Activist investors who’ve pressed companies to release more data on DEI and climate initiatives have been willing to cut companies some slack this year, given the heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration.

At risk

Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, which supports social responsibility, said executives have been asking him privately for some flexibility in what information they release this year.

“We told them to not put themselves at risk right now,” he said. “That isn’t good for anyone.”

And the caution is warranted, said GianCarlo Canaparo, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has warned against possible discrimination in company DEI programmes.

Corporate leaders are aware that Trump has asked agency heads to identify nine companies or organisations that should be investigated for possible illegal DEI activities, he said. So far, the names haven’t been made public, but it’s clearly on companies’ radar, he added.

“If you have been using race preferences, you really want to make sure you don’t get caught,” Canaparo said. “And if you haven’t, you want to make sure you aren’t dragged into litigation to explore whether you have.” BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/8169597847b68a52ca9e61678d69bc3581fa53b02c40add846b08bb6f68aaeb1?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-06-08 09:59:32.308029

Witnessing workplace mistreatment We interviewed 554 employees who had witnessed workplace mistreatment within the past two weeks at the time the survey was conducted.
When they respond quickly, support targets openly and hold perpetrators accountable, they challenge the perception that mistreatment is inevitable.
Support targets openly and meaningfully System justification often works by undermining the credibility of those being mistreated.
Why this matters Much of the existing research on workplace mistreatment has focused on the importance of bystander and leader intervention.","“You always mess things up. Why are you even on this project? Just quit already.” Demeaning, hostile or undermining behaviour like this is more common in the workplace and damaging than many people realize. One in three employees experience such behaviours, and almost half witness them.

Rather than intervening, supporting targets or reporting the misconduct, research shows bystanders may downplay it, withdraw support or even blame the target, which ultimately reinforces the mistreatment.

As our recent study shows, this is largely because when mistreatment seems inevitable or commonplace, bystanders are psychologically motivated to justify it rather than challenge it.

Why do bystanders rationalize mistreatment?

Humans are hardwired to see mistreatment as wrong. Most of us value fairness and want to punish wrongdoing. But if this is the case, why do bystanders so often fail to act when they witness mistreatment?

Our recent research explores this question drawing on system justification theory — the idea that people are motivated to see the systems they live and work in as fair, legitimate and stable.

When mistreatment seems inevitable — when people think “that’s just how things work around here” — bystanders face a psychological dilemma. They can either challenge the behaviour and risk conflict, exclusion or backlash, or they can rationalize it as normal or deserved.

Most people, often without realizing it, choose the latter. This mental shortcut allows them to preserve the comforting belief that the system is fair and people get what they deserve.

Witnessing workplace mistreatment

We interviewed 554 employees who had witnessed workplace mistreatment within the past two weeks at the time the survey was conducted. They shared their thoughts on how inevitable they believed the mistreatment incident was, and how tolerant they felt their organization was toward such behaviour.

In a follow-up survey, we asked these employees whether they felt the incident they witnessed was justifiable and the target as deserving. A week later, in a third survey, we asked these bystanders to report how they behaved toward the target, and whether they tried to address or minimize the incident.

We found that when bystanders perceived mistreatment as inevitable, they were more likely to see the incident as justified and targets as deserving of that treatment. These bystanders were more likely to socially distance themselves from the target, engage in negative gossip about them and were less willing to offer help.

Bystander inaction wasn’t due to cowardice or callousness, but was often a defence mechanism. Rationalizing mistreatment allowed bystanders to preserve the belief that their workplace was just. But this coping strategy can deepen harm for those who experience mistreatment, who may be further marginalized, isolated or discredited.

How mistreatment is normalized

Workplace climates play a key role in the normalization of mistreatment. Our findings indicate when employees believed their workplace tolerated mistreatment, they were more likely to rationalize it and less likely to support the person being mistreated.

In these contexts, mistreatment isn’t just ignored, but is quietly accepted. Tacit acceptance sends a powerful message: this is normal, this is deserved, this is not worth challenging.

What does a toxic, permissive workplace look like? Warning signs include staff who feel anxious about coming to work and leaders who publicly criticize employees or tell them to “toughen up” or “not take it personally.”

If negative gossip is tolerated, or reports of mistreatment are ignored or delayed, these are also strong indicators that mistreatment has been normalized.

Organizations may fail to acknowledge these patterns for a variety of reasons, including resistance, denial or a lack of readiness. But surfacing these issues is a strength, not a weakness. It allows organizations to address root causes, retain valuable employees, and foster a more respectful environment.

4 ways to create positive change

Even in workplaces where mistreatment has become normalized, positive change is possible. Research shows that effectively managing everyday incidents can create bottom-up effects that support broader positive change within the workplace, ultimately improving workplace climate.

Managers have a particularly pivotal role to play. When they respond quickly, support targets openly and hold perpetrators accountable, they challenge the perception that mistreatment is inevitable. They also send a broader message about what behaviours are and aren’t acceptable in the workplace.

Here are four evidence-based strategies that can help disrupt the bystander dynamic and improve workplace culture:

1. Challenge the narrative of inevitability

Organizations should clearly signal that mistreatment will not be tolerated in their workplace. This includes explicitly communicating behavioural expectations, investigating reports quickly and transparently, and ensuring senior leaders model respectful behaviour. These small but visible actions disrupt the sense that mistreatment is “just how things work.”

2. Reduce ambiguity

When organizations don’t define behavioural norms clearly, bystanders are more likely to rationalize mistreatment. Organizations should define what mistreatment includes, such as exclusion and sarcastic comments, and distinguish it from tough feedback or constructive conflict. Training can help employees recognize subtle forms of harm and reflect on how their reactions would appear to someone they respect.

3. Enforce consequences consistently

When policies exist but aren’t enforced, bystanders learn that mistreatment carries no cost. Organizations need to follow through on mistreatment policies, protect those who report it and make it clear that retaliation is unacceptable. Visibility matters: people need to see that action is taken.

4. Support targets openly and meaningfully

System justification often works by undermining the credibility of those being mistreated. Managers can counteract this by affirming the value of a person targeted, encouraging reintegration and monitoring their teams for subtle social exclusion. When targets are supported by respected leaders, bystanders are more likely to follow suit because people tend to look to leader behaviour towards employees as a sign of their value to the group.

Why this matters

Much of the existing research on workplace mistreatment has focused on the importance of bystander and leader intervention. Our research adds a deeper layer by illustrating that bystanders may not intervene because they are subconsciously defending their belief in a fair and legitimate system.

This defence mechanism is especially dangerous when mistreatment is common, creating a cycle in which the most vulnerable employees are harmed twice: first by the perpetrator, and then by those who fail to stand by them.

Breaking this cycle requires more than training videos or one-off statements. It requires reshaping the climate that makes mistreatment seem normal, inevitable or trivial.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/671693/original/file-20250602-62-ogqtgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C487%2C5411%2C2705&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-08 12:10:52.228648

In the United States, Saitex has spent approximately 25 million dollars.","Donald Trump wants to open and reopen factories, using tariffs as a tool. Companies looking to relocate their production are trying to find the right ways to do so.

The American president has triggered a global trade war based on a bet, namely that taxing other countries would bring back jobs and factories to the United States. Many business people are skeptical. But Sanjeev Bahl is optimistic.

From his factory in Los Angeles, Bahl oversees about 250 people who sew, cut, and fold jeans for brands like Everlane, J. Crew, and Ralph Lauren. Together, they produce 70,000 pairs of denim jeans per month. ""America,"" he says, ""can make things again.""

However, there is a problem. The operation only works because his company, Saitex, owns a much larger factory and spinning mill in southern Vietnam, where thousands of workers produce 500,000 pairs of jeans per month.

The tariffs imposed by Trump have disrupted supply chains, affected businesses, and brought corporate leaders together on one question: does America have what it takes to bring jobs back home? - writes The New York Times.

What America is Missing

In many industries, this approach would take years, if not decades. The United States lacks nearly every element of the production ecosystem - workers, training, technology, and government support.

""There are some harsh realities,"" said Matt Priest, executive director of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group.

And Trump's strategy is shrouded in uncertainty. Last month, he stated, ""We don't want to make sneakers and T-shirts"" in the United States. However, the toughest tariffs he imposed, set to take effect in July, were aimed at countries producing clothing and footwear for the American market. Vietnam, with 46%, was one of the most affected countries.

China Uses Vietnam to Bypass Trump's Huge Tariffs

These tariffs, designed to compel companies to bring their production capabilities back home, were deemed illegal by a ruling issued last week by the U.S. International Trade Court. The decision was temporarily suspended by another court, giving judges time to evaluate an appeal by the Trump administration. Amid all the legal disputes, Trump promised to find other ways to disrupt trade rules.

The Trump administration's policy has exposed the difficulties in reducing the vast geographical and logistical distances between where many products are manufactured and where they are consumed.

For executives like Bahl of Saitex, the disruptions caused by Trump's trade policies have added another issue to the challenges of managing global supply chains.

""The prolonged fear and uncertainty brought by the Covid pandemic were unforeseen. There was nothing to help us but the instinct for survival,"" said Bahl.

He believes Saitex could be a model for other clothing companies. ""We could be the catalyst for the hypothesis that production can be brought back to the United States,"" he said. But his experience underscores how difficult it would be. There are no factories in America the size the industry needs, nor major zipper and button suppliers. The operating cost of a factory is high. Then there is the labor issue: there simply aren't enough workers, notes the American newspaper.

In response to the pandemic situation, Saitex opened a factory in Los Angeles in 2021. Since Trump announced his intention to impose high tariffs on Vietnam, Bahl has been considering how much more he could produce in the United States. He could probably bring about 20% of production to the United States, up from the current 10%, he said.

Americans Don't Want to Work in Factories, and Immigrants Are Expelled from the U.S.

American factories are already struggling to find people for about 500,000 jobs in this field, according to economists at Wells Fargo. According to their calculations, for the share of production in employment to return to the peak of the 1970s, to which Trump has sometimes referred, new factories employing 22 million people would need to be opened.

Currently, there are 7.2 million unemployed people in the U.S., the newspaper notes.

Trump's punitive approach to immigration has worsened things. Factory jobs have moved abroad, to countries like Vietnam, which had a growing population and young people looking for jobs to escape poverty.

The future Trump envisions, with millions of factory jobs, should include immigrants seeking the same opportunities in the United States.

Under Pressure from American Tariffs, Vietnam Plays a Double Game Between the U.S. and China

Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, a lobbying group for the fashion industry, said there is a gap between the ""romantic notion of manufacturing"" and the availability of American workers.

""Many say we should make more clothes in the U.S., but when you ask them, they don't want themselves or their children to work in a factory,"" he said. ""The problem is there are no other people around,"" he added.

At the Saitex factory in Los Angeles, most workers come from countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador.

Approximately 97% of the clothing and footwear Americans buy are imported for cost reasons. Companies that produce everything in the United States include firms like Federal Prison Industries, also known as Unicor, which employ inmates to make military uniforms for less than the minimum wage, Lamar said.

Other companies, like New Balance and Ralph Lauren, produce some of their fashion lines in the United States. Others are experimenting with a model where they produce small batches of clothing in the United States to test patterns and gauge popularity before placing large orders - usually from factories in other countries.

Important Lesson for Europe: Trump Backs Down Under Pressure

It is difficult to produce things in large volume in America. For Bahl, it all comes down to the cost of a sewing machine operator - in Los Angeles, that person is paid about $4,000 a month. In Vietnam, the salary is $500.

In his factory there, which Bahl established in 2012 in Dong Nai province, an hour's drive from Ho Chi Minh City, over a dozen sewing lines are carefully arranged and operate six days a week.

""The speed is much faster in Vietnam,"" says Gilles Cousin, a factory manager overseeing the sewing section.

All Calculations Depend on an Unpredictable Man

If Trump truly wants to bring back jobs, he should grant some tariff exemptions to companies like Saitex, which have a larger presence in the United States, Bahl said. American factories like his cannot expand without importing many of the components that go into their finished products.

In turn, Saitex delivers bales of American cotton to Vietnam, where its two-story factory turns fluffy cotton lint into yarn and eventually into rolls of fabric. The textile is then dyed and shipped back to the United States for the Los Angeles factory.

Until there is enough momentum from companies producing various things in the United States, the material, zippers, and buttons will have to be brought into the country.

Shifting production from abroad would also require massive investments. Saitex has invested around $150 million in Vietnam, where its factory recycles 98% of water, air-dries denim, and uses technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate labor-intensive practices.

In the United States, Saitex has spent approximately 25 million dollars. These are long-term commitments that take at least seven years to recover, Bahl explains.

In the end, if Trump decides to maintain the initial 46% tax on Vietnam, and Saitex cannot mitigate the financial impact, they should look towards other markets to sell the products manufactured in Vietnam - such as Europe, where they currently deliver about half of what they produce. ""But then what happens to our factory here?"" Bahl asks about the California unit.

It all depends on Trump. And, ultimately, on American justice.

Burger King is betting on offering memorable experiences that go beyond the product.","Burger King has launched a campaign that's generating a lot of buzz in the United States. The chain has just introduced a special menu inspired by the popular movie ""How to Train Your Dragon."" This strategy aims to attract families and movie lovers. In addition, it represents a major blow to McDonald's, its historic competitor, known for their collaborations with children's movies.

Since May 27, the themed menu has been available at Burger King locations across the country. The star dish is the ""Dragon Flame-Grilled Whopper."" It's a burger with the brand's classic flame-grilled flavor, but with a special touch that makes it unique.

Alongside this burger, mozzarella and Calabrian chili fries are offered. This combination gives it a different flavor, a mix of creamy and spicy, that aims to surprise customers. Strawberry lemonade is also included, a refreshing and sweet drink that perfectly complements the meal.

Themed desserts complete the menu, creating an experience that goes beyond flavor. Burger King wants every bite to remind customers of the movie and for the meal to be part of the fun.

The chain has added an element that's sure to delight the youngest customers. The kids' menus now include ""How to Train Your Dragon"" themed toys. These toys are designed to connect with the story and characters from the movie, increasing children's excitement when visiting Burger King.

Burger King Goes Much Further

The experience doesn't end there. Burger King has launched an interactive game on its mobile app. Customers can play and win prizes related to the promotion.

Among the prizes are gift cards for AMC Theatres, the movie theater chain where the film can be enjoyed. There's also a trip to Universal Orlando Resort, a very popular destination among families.

This initiative not only aims to attract customers, but also to keep them loyal. By offering prizes and fun, Burger King creates a stronger connection with its consumers. This strategy also puts McDonald's on the spot, as they have traditionally led promotions linked to children's movies.

Burger King has shown that it's willing to innovate and compete aggressively in the U.S. market. Betting on such a beloved franchise as ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a calculated move to capture the attention of the family audience.

This campaign comes at a time when competition in the fast food sector is more intense than ever. Chains are seeking to differentiate themselves not only with the quality of their food, but with experiences that attract different customer segments.

The combination of themed food, toys, and an interactive game with prizes turns a visit to Burger King into more than just a meal. It's an event that can attract the whole family and generate a greater flow of customers.

Ultimately, Burger King has managed to create a complete and appealing promotion. By integrating the movie, the food, and the prizes, the chain positions itself strongly in a highly competitive market.

This initiative could mark a turning point in how fast food chains design their promotional campaigns.

The road to better EV batteries has been decades in the making, but the next big breakthrough might be right around the corner.","Press Release

It’s easy to think of electric vehicles as a modern innovation, but over a century ago, they dominated the streets. In 1900, lead-acid batteries provided a range of up to 100 miles, which was quite remarkable at the time. As roads improved and vehicles became faster though, these heavy, low-energy-density batteries struggled to keep up. Internal combustion engines took over, and EVs faded into history.

Fast forward to 1996. An American manufacturer launched an all-electric car that relied on the same lead-acid technology from a hundred years before. Its second generation, also equipped with nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, failed to compete with gasoline-powered vehicles. The problem? Energy density. These batteries simply couldn’t store enough power to make EVs practical for daily use.

Then, in 1998, A Japanese manufacturer introduced an EV with a lithium-ion battery. It didn’t make headlines, but in hindsight, it marked a turning point. Lithium-ion technology could store up to three times more energy than lead-acid batteries and about twice as much as NiMH. A decade later, the world finally took notice.

However, “lithium-ion” is not a single technology but an umbrella term for several distinct chemistries. Most rely on a graphite anode, but the real advancements come from the cathode.

Early lithium-ion batteries combined lithium with nickel, cobalt, or manganese. Over time, manufacturers fine-tuned these blends to balance energy density, safety, and cost. One thing has remained consistent: the industry has been reducing cobalt content, which is both expensive and ethically controversial, in favor of high-nickel formulations.

Another chemistry, lithium iron phosphate (LFP), has taken off for its affordability and safety. The trade-off? Slightly less energy storage. Yet, by 2024, LFP and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries are expected to power 94% of light electric vehicles worldwide, according to S&P Global Mobility.

The improvements aren’t just on paper. A recent study by Geotab found that EV batteries now degrade at just 1.8% per year, down from 2.3% in 2019. At this rate, batteries could last over 20 years—far exceeding concerns about longevity.

Companies like VinFast are capitalizing on these advancements. Their vehicles integrate cutting-edge battery management systems designed to extend battery life and improve safety.

But they’re not stopping there. VinFast is actively investing in battery research and collaborating with leading partners to develop the next wave of EV technology. Their confidence shows in their industry-leading warranties—spanning seven to ten years, depending on the model. For EV buyers, that means less worry and more miles on the road.

What’s Next for EV Batteries?

Looking ahead, two emerging technologies could change everything.

Solid-state batteries replace flammable liquid electrolytes with stable, solid materials. This shift could boost energy storage by 50-80% while reducing fire risk.

Sodium-ion batteries offer another breakthrough. Instead of relying on lithium, they use abundant sodium, making them cheaper and more sustainable. Their energy density is lower than LFP, but they excel in safety and cold-weather performance.

Both technologies still have challenges to overcome, but advancements are picking up speed. As costs fall and performance improves, EVs could soon surpass gas-powered cars in both longevity and reliability.

The road to better EV batteries has been decades in the making, but the next big breakthrough might be right around the corner.",,N,,2025-06-08 05:01:20.029554

Barclays analysts following the closing arguments came away with mixed views.

“We listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better, in terms of GOOGL stock price impact,” analyst at Barclays said.

A decision is expected in late July or early August, and any measures could begin 60 days later.

Barclays flagged the potential cancellation of Google’s traffic acquisition costs and ad syndication deals as the biggest financial risks, estimating they could account for up to 20% of gross profit globally, or 10% if applied only to the U.S. market.

While a forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser still appears unlikely, Barclays said the odds have “increased” and called such a move a major blow to GOOGL but a significant win for any acquirer, citing names like OpenAI.

It added that the judge’s tone suggested some of the DOJ’s proposed actions could be adopted, potentially ruling out softer options like non-exclusive revenue sharing via choice screens.

The global population continues to grow at a rapid clip, with the United Nations (UN) forecasting that there will 11.2 billion people by 2100, up from 8.1 billion now.","In a world that increasingly feels volatile and perplexing, a seismic shift in the paradigms guiding global economics is underway. In this commentary provided by Project Syndicate (PS), Dambisa Moyo, an international economist, and author of four New York Times best-selling books, advise policymakers and business leaders to recalibrate their mental models to address three transformative structural dynamics: the ebb and flow of capital, relentless demographic shifts, and the ideological divides fracturing global unity.

As the world becomes more volatile and confusing, policymakers, business leaders, and investors will need to rethink the mental models they use to analyse the global economy. Specifically, they should pay attention to three structural dynamics that are altering the global landscape: capital flows, demographic shifts, and political ideology, which are ushering in a more fragmented and siloed world.

Changes to capital flows are driven largely by regulatory requirements (such as the US ban on investments in China) and investors' pursuit of new opportunities for higher returns across sectors and regions. The United States currently represents nearly 70pc of stock-market capitalisation worldwide, attracting more than 70pc of flows into the 13 trillion dollars global market for private investments, which include equity and credit. This is true despite the recent sell-off.

The US stock market is where investors can generate the most attractive returns, as the US is a global leader in innovation with broad, liquid, and deep capital markets.

But global debt has reached 237pc of world GDP, raising concerns about who owns outstanding liabilities and the extent to which there is hidden leverage in the global financial system. The US government alone owes 36 trillion dollars (or 124pc of GDP), a large proportion of which is held by China, with which relations are strained.

Hidden leverage and the shadow banking sector's debts could become a problem. According to S&P Global, shadow banks held 63 trillion dollars in financial assets at the end of 2022, representing 78pc of global GDP. And, further analysis has also shown that in 2024, shadow banking accounted for 70pc of US mortgage origination and leveraged lending. Investors and business leaders will need to ask themselves who holds what debt, and where debt obligations and major pools of financial leverage may lie.

The second big worry concerns demographics. The global population continues to grow at a rapid clip, with the United Nations (UN) forecasting that there will 11.2 billion people by 2100, up from 8.1 billion now. Already, almost 90pc of the world's population lives in poorer emerging markets, and economically poorer regions – such as Africa, India, and the Middle East – are projected to experience population growth at or above the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.

Thus, these regions will continue to skew younger. Across Africa, 50pc to 60pc of the population is below the age of 25, compared to only 20pc across the OECD.

Other countries are aging rapidly and registering lower birth rates, with forecasts for Europe and China pointing to marked population declines. According to Eurostat, the European Union's population is projected to peak at 453.3 million in 2026, before gradually decreasing to 419.5 million by 2100. According to UN data, China's population is expected to decline below 800 million by 2100, from its current level of 1.4 billion.

Such trends have far-reaching implications for global demand and production across a wide array of commodities such as foodstuffs and energy. For example, India, with its large, poorer population, is still heavily dependent on coal and fossil fuels, as compared to renewables.

Demographic changes will also alter financial portfolios as aging populations switch from being capitalists (willing to take on risk) to rentiers (desiring stable, predictable fixed incomes). But markets will also have to calibrate for unprecedented intergenerational wealth transfers from baby boomers to millennials. Cerulli Associates estimates that this could amount to 84 trillion dollars by 2045.

Finally, the ideological splits across countries and regions should be factored in. The breakdown of multilateralism and the fragmentation of trade, capital flows, migration, and ideas are all being priced in, and policymakers and business leaders will have to keep these trends in mind. America's largest multinationals still generate more than half of their revenues outside the US. But they now need to consider what strained US alliances and traditional trading relationships will mean for their businesses.

For business more broadly, deglobalisation has forced a shift toward more centralised procurement, hiring, and trade in goods and services. It is also jeopardising carry trades (borrowing cheaply in New York and London to invest in higher-yielding regions) and making it harder to repatriate profits.

In the near term, the Trump administration's tariffs and deportations could affect salaries and fuel higher inflation in consumer goods, wages, and prices across sectors. Higher inflation, moreover, will likely drive up the cost of capital, which could suppress business investment. Over the long term, deglobalisation and technological advances – such as AI and quantum computing – will further entrench today's ideological splits.

Geopolitical fissures have already raised big political questions. There is a tug of war between state capitalism and market capitalism, and over the reconfiguration of alliances and country groupings. New blocs, such as the BRICS+, are vying for global influence and seeking to circumvent traditional multilateral institutions. The BRICS+ countries already represent 45pc of the world's population and 35pc of its GDP, and they are playing a growing role in the pricing and trade of many internationally traded goods and commodities.

Such developments are making it harder for countries to achieve global alignment; even previously celebrated efforts like the United Nations Climate Change Conferences have been hobbled.

As global growth slows, trade, finance, religion, energy, AI, and immigration are all being weaponised, leading to much greater complexity that will make it harder to anticipate policy outcomes. As a practical matter, added complexity and reduced visibility will likely shorten the time horizons for crucial decisions about allocating capital and human resources.

Rather than looking five years ahead, typically assumed to be the length of an economic or business cycle, investors, business leaders, and policymakers may need to think more in terms of the next 18 months. Amid so much volatility, decision-makers will have to focus on adaptability. No one can afford to commit to long-term strategies based on regulatory, geopolitical, or economic conditions that might change overnight.

Strengthening the Kingdom’s retail sector, including the development of shopping destinations, is one of the crucial goals outlined in the Vision 2030 program, as Saudi Arabia aims to become a global hub of business and tourism by the end of the decade.

In June, a report by global real estate consultancy Knight Frank revealed that Riyadh is leading the Kingdom’s retail transformation, with mall rents up 4 percent in a year and 2.2 million sq. meters of new retail space planned by 2030.

According to the analysis, average mall rent in the Saudi capital rose to SR2,848 ($765) per sq. meter by the end of March, with occupancy rates up 5 percent to reach 92 percent in the first quarter of 2025.

Speaking to Arab News, Olivier de Cointet, senior adviser at management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, said that shopping malls are set to thrive in the Kingdom as they evolve into social venues rather than mere shopping destinations.

“With retailtainment, which is the fusion of retail and entertainment, becoming an essential part of the customer experience, malls play a significant role in supporting the Kingdom’s vision to become a business and tourist destination hub,” said Cointet.

He added: “These destinations enhance Saudi Arabia’s appeal as a business and tourism hotspot and keep more consumer spending within the Kingdom.”

Anthony Spary, head of retail, leasing, and offices at CBRE for the Middle East and North Africa region, echoed similar views, saying that shopping malls in the Kingdom could serve as social hubs for both locals and visitors, promoting cultural exchange and providing a platform for both international and homegrown brands.

Today’s consumer expects seamless integration between all channels, and this benefits physical as well as digital retail in terms of driving footfall, experience, and convenience.

Sundeep Khanna, partner at ADL

“Malls often feature concepts such as family entertainment centers, cinemas, cultural events as well as unique anchor attractions, all of which will draw tourists and encourage repeat footfall with residents,” said Spary.

Joe Abi Akl, partner and head of Oliver Wyman’s Retail and Consumer practice for India, the Middle East and Africa, said that shopping malls in Saudi Arabia have allocated nearly half of their gross leased area to non-retail activities, which could help them serve as social and entertainment destinations.

“Shopping malls, with a pipeline exceeding 6 million sq. meters of GLA, play a vital role in this vision by offering integrated, experience-led environments. With more than 40 percent of mall space planned for non-retail activities, they’re not just commercial centers, but social and cultural anchors that enrich the Kingdom’s appeal as a leisure and lifestyle destination,” said Abi Akl.

These comments align with Saudi Arabia’s efforts to become a global hub for tourism and business by the end of the decade, with the Real Estate General Authority projecting the property market to reach $101.62 billion by 2029, representing a compound annual growth rate of 8 percent from 2024.

Shaping retail spending

CBRE’s Spary said the rising number of shopping malls in the Kingdom is expected to boost retail spending as they provide consumers with convenience and a wide variety of product choices.

“Saudi Arabia offers a unique retail landscape in the region, providing a blend of strip malls, line retail, as well as community and regional shopping districts. This new wave of shopping malls will only add to this offering and create a more varied mix for the consumer,” added Spary.

These views regarding consumer spending align with the findings of a recent report published by global consulting firm AlixPartners, which said the Kingdom’s consumer market is evolving rapidly, characterized by adaptability, shifting spending patterns, and resilience in the face of global economic challenges.

AlixPartners noted that the groceries and clothing categories are expected to remain key spending sectors in 2025, with consumers prioritizing value-driven deals and savings.

Craig Watson, head of retail at JLL in the Kingdom, stated that the development of several high-quality retail centers will transform the consumer experience across Saudi Arabia, offering a wide array of choices and ultimately boosting overall spending.

“When regions go through extensive and rapid growth, the consumer is always the winner, with increased supply providing new and exciting concepts to experience. The retail mix, success, and execution of these places will ultimately determine the share of wallet and who benefits most,” said Watson.

In February, during the Retail Leaders Circle, Abdellah Iftahy, senior partner at McKinsey and Co., said that the Kingdom’s retail sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a digitally savvy young population and increasing consumer confidence.

He added that by 2035, 75 percent of retail spending is expected to come from the Saudi youth.

E-commerce vs. shopping malls

Although the growth of e-commerce in Saudi Arabia may pose challenges for traditional retail formats, it can also complement the development of malls in the Kingdom, according to experts.

Watson notes that the Kingdom has emerged as a major e-commerce hub in the Middle East and North Africa, driven by its young, tech-savvy population and expanding internet coverage.

He believes the growth of the e-commerce sector will not negatively impact the operations of shopping malls nationwide.

“As is the case with every region, the overwhelming majority of retail sales is derived from brick-and-mortar transactions. Malls will need to adapt by integrating technology, enhancing the customer experience and offering unique in-person experiences that cannot be replicated online,” said Watson.

According to Spary, many consumers still prefer the tactile experience of shopping in person, and malls can integrate e-commerce by offering click-and-collect services.

“Malls can serve as experiential spaces where brands showcase their products, attracting customers who enjoy the physical shopping experience. Taking into account both cultural shopping preferences as well as the impact of the climate on consumer behavior, increasing e-commerce penetration will add to the overall omnichannel approach that retailers are adopting across the region,” said Spary.

Sundeep Khanna, partner at ADL, said that the growth of the e-commerce sector is not cannibalising shopping malls, but is actually complementing them.

“Today’s consumer expects seamless integration between all channels, and this benefits physical as well as digital retail in terms of driving footfall, experience, and convenience,” said Khanna.

Attracting international brands

Spary told Arab News that the transformation and upgrade of retail offerings in the market of Saudi Arabia will pave the way for new international brands to enter and grow within the Kingdom, contributing to the country’s wider economic goals.

According to the CBRE official, the entry of new brands will not only enhance consumer choices but also stimulate a competitive environment that encourages brand expansion and attracts investment.

“CBRE is currently seeing record levels of demand from international brands looking to expand into the region. This demand is likely to continue given the robust and ever-maturing nature of this market,” said Spary.

Cointet noted that Saudi Arabia has become an attractive destination for global fashion, luxury, and food and beverage retailers, drawn by the population’s strong spending power and the rise of premium mall spaces such as Riyadh Park and Mall of Arabia.

“Mall expansion goes hand-in-hand with pro-investment reforms — for example, Saudi Arabia now allows 100 percent foreign ownership in the retail sector, encouraging international companies and developers to invest directly,” added Cointet.

The Arthur D. Little official further stated that the expansion of shopping malls in the Kingdom will also provide local brands with unprecedented opportunities to establish a national and international footprint.

“This is critical for developing the Saudi economy and I anticipate we will see more Saudi-owned brands enter the world stage in the coming years,” added Cointet.

Potential challenges

The experts also highlighted some of the challenges in Saudi Arabia’s retail landscape, particularly surrounding shopping malls, including oversupply.

“Whilst there’s certainly a risk of oversupply with many large projects due to be delivered over the course of the next two to three years, the need for continuous innovation and adaptation to changing consumer trends will be crucial for the sustainability of shopping malls in the Kingdom,” said Spary.

The CBRE official further said that new attractions, entertainment options, and cultural elements will play a pivotal role in reshaping the retail landscape in the market.

Spary added that the integration of these features will create a more engaging and immersive experience for consumers, ultimately redefining how shopping is perceived and enjoyed in the Kingdom.

Cointet expressed a slightly different view, stating that the demand for malls in Saudi Arabia is expected to rise in the coming years due to population growth.

He explained that this challenge could be addressed by developing large-format mega malls that serve as destinations in themselves, alongside smaller community malls designed to offer convenience at the local level.

In April, a separate analysis by S&P Global said that oversupply, changing retail preferences, and pressure on rental yields amid elevated capital expenditure by landlords could exert pressure on the Kingdom’s retail sector.

According to the US-based agency, the volume of retail projects in the pipeline raises the risk of potential oversupply, particularly in secondary locations where demand may not be sufficient to absorb new retail spaces.

Discussing the risk of oversupply, Cointet said: “Saudi Arabia’s aggressive development pipeline of new retail space underway — raises the risk of too much supply coming to market, which could pressure occupancies and rents in some areas, or even threaten the launch of some of the programs.”

He added: “Landlords and developers may need to differentiate their properties with unique experiences, dining, and entertainment offerings — and even offer lease incentives — to avoid saturation and keep shoppers engaged in an evolving retail landscape.”",,N,,2025-06-08 05:01:25.131089

For years, Tesla Insurance promised lower costs by leaning into what the company claimed was a unique advantage: real-time driving data and deep familiarity with its own cars. But a new report suggests those ambitions may be unraveling.

With insurance costs for Tesla owners already being high, this latest development could make electric vehicle ownership even less affordable for everyday consumers.

What's happening?

According to new data from S&P Global, Tesla Insurance reported a loss ratio of 92.5% in 2023, meaning the company paid out 92.5 cents in claims for every dollar it brought in through premiums. Once overhead costs are added, that number suggests Tesla is likely losing money on its insurance program.

In 2019, Tesla began to roll out its insurance products in select U.S. states to help bring down notoriously high premiums for its vehicles. The company leaned on its tech-heavy features, like Autopilot and real-time Safety Scores, to personalize rates. Still, Tesla owners have mixed reviews, with some struggling to secure better quotes than they'd get elsewhere.

This latest report contradicts Tesla's repeated claims that its vehicles are less likely to crash and cheaper to repair. If that were the case, its insurance program would be thriving, not floundering.

Why is this concerning?

If Tesla Insurance continues to underperform, it could lead to higher premiums or more limited coverage options for drivers. It's not just frustrating; it could also make switching to an EV more difficult for people already weighing cost concerns, which also has broader consequences.

A slowdown in EV adoption, particularly among more budget-conscious consumers, risks slowing down our shift away from gas-powered cars, which produce pollution that contributes to the overheating of our planet.

This isn't the first sign of turbulence for Tesla. The company's 2025 sales have seen a slump, including a 62% drop in new registrations in the U.K. and the recalls linked to its Autopilot software. Together, these stories paint a picture of a company under increasing pressure to maintain its once-dominant position in the EV space.

What's being done about it?

To keep EV adoption on track, several policies and tools are helping to offset the cost of going electric. Federal tax credits, including up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models, can reduce the upfront cost of buying electric. Some states also offer additional rebates or incentives.

If you're shopping for insurance on an electric car, be sure to compare quotes across providers and check whether features like real-time tracking or usage-based pricing will actually benefit you. As EV tech evolves, informed choices can help you save money and stay on the road to a cleaner future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-recAtglsHXJSlA8kk.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 22:01:22.319721

At €2,280 million, sales were slightly down on the previous year’s figure (€2,395 million).
The free cash flow was once again significantly positive at €51 million (previous year: €56 million).
HEIDELBERG ended financial year 2024/25 with a high level of incoming orders.
This is emphasized by the high level of incoming orders at May’s China Print trade show, which will have a positive impact in the new financial year.","Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HEIDELBERG) is starting financial year 2025/26 on a strong note. Based on its global market position, its portfolio expansion in strategic growth markets, and a much-improved cost basis, and despite a difficult economic climate, the company is expecting a slight increase in sales to around €2,350 million in the new financial year and an adjusted operating margin of up to 8%.

It sees growth potential in a number of areas. These include playing a leading role as a systems integrator for packaging and digital printing with hybrid printing solutions, combining software and service business in a digital ecosystem, and expanding the operation of charging infrastructure, including DC technology.

HEIDELBERG is also expecting a big boost from the Asia/Pacific region. Healthy incoming orders at May’s China Print trade show confirmed this and created the basis for a successful start to the new financial year.

“Significant strategic and operational improvements have paved the way for further profitable growth,” says Jürgen Otto, CEO of HEIDELBERG. “Our measures will make a substantial contribution to the expected increase in sales. Enhanced efficiency and performance will further boost our profitability. Encouragingly, the capital market is also increasingly acknowledging our focus on economic efficiency and liquidity,” he added.

In financial year 2024/25, HEIDELBERG held its own in a difficult market environment and met its targets. The adjusted EBITDA margin remained stable at 7.1%, for example, ending the financial year on a successful note. The cost-cutting and efficiency measures initiated by the company successfully compensated for a slightly lower volume of sales than in the previous year, rising wage costs, and expenses relating to the drupa trade show.

In the fourth quarter alone, the adjusted EBITDA margin doubled compared with the previous year and reached around 10%. At €2,280 million, sales were slightly down on the previous year’s figure (€2,395 million). Following a weak first quarter due to purchasing restraint ahead of the drupa industry trade show, sales during the financial year increased quarter by quarter and were particularly strong in the fourth quarter. The free cash flow was once again significantly positive at €51 million (previous year: €56 million).

HEIDELBERG ended financial year 2024/25 with a high level of incoming orders. In the fourth quarter, the figure of €611 million for incoming orders was up on the previous quarters of the financial year. One reason for this is the company’s global and diversified setup, which enables HEIDELBERG to benefit from the different growth dynamics in the individual regions. This is emphasized by the high level of incoming orders at May’s China Print trade show, which will have a positive impact in the new financial year.

During financial year 2024/25 as a whole, HEIDELBERG generated incoming orders of around €2,433 million, which was 6% up on the previous year’s level (€2,288 million). This also resulted in a corresponding big increase in the order backlog as at March 31, 2025 – from €652 million on the same reference date the previous year to €722 million. The Packaging Solutions and Print Solutions segments benefited from the product innovations presented at drupa.

Their incoming orders for financial year 2024/25 both increased – by around 7% to €1,272 million for the Packaging Solutions segment and by about 6% to €1,155 million for the Print Solutions segment.

“Thanks to the improving order situation and the positive momentum from the China Print trade show, we are expecting a better start to the new financial year than we had the previous year,” said Dr. David Schmedding, chief technology & sales officer at HEIDELBERG. “Our new portfolio of very large format presses for packaging reaffirms our approach of gradually further expanding our portfolio in growth segments.”",https://www.inkworldmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/07/ink-favicon.png,N,,2025-06-07 21:01:08.337960

The ONS has estimated 2.8 million people are employed in occupations essential to R&D activities across all sectors in 2023: R&D skills supply and demand: long-term trends and workforce projections - GOV.UK.","Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce a transformative £86 billion in the Spending Review to turbo-charge our fastest growing sectors, from tech and life sciences, to advanced manufacturing and defence, as part of the government’s plan to invest in Britain’s renewal through our Modern Industrial Strategy.

Britain will boost its world-leading status in research and innovation with a bumper funding package worth more than £22.5 billion a year in 2029/2030. From exploring new drug treatments and longer lasting batteries, to new AI breakthroughs, the package will drive new jobs and economic growth as well as ensuring the UK leads the way in pioneering the technologies of the future.

It comes ahead of the Spending Review, where the Chancellor will set out how the government will invest in Britain’s renewal by investing in the people’s priorities: health, security and the economy. The Chancellor will outline this government’s laser focus on investing in Britain’s renewal through projects that will bring jobs and prosperity, putting more money in working people’s pockets.

The new R&D package will mean local leaders have government backing to develop ‘innovation clusters’ across the country, to unlock the talent and opportunity in every region and nation.

It is those with skin in the game who know what is best for their region. That’s why, through the new Local Innovation Partnerships Fund, local leaders will be given the powers to decide how to target their research investment in the region and make the most of skill sets of the community, boosting high skilled jobs and igniting growth across the country, the core mission of the government’s Plan for Change.

The package will see every corner of the country benefit. In Liverpool, that means leveraging its expertise in life sciences to accelerate drug discovery, in Northern Ireland that means harnessing its reputation for cutting edge defence equipment to shore up our national security. And in South Wales, it means boosting expertise in designing cutting edge semiconductors that power the devices like mobile phones and electric cars we rely on every day to support growth and new jobs in those regions.

The new funding will build on work already underway to transform local communities through the Innovation Accelerator pilot scheme – a new funding approach and partnership between local authorities and government. It has supported new technology developed by the Greater Manchester advanced diagnostic accelerator, delivering quicker and cheaper detection for liver, heart and lung diseases, whilst Moonbility from the West Midlands is using AI software helping train companies to simulate, in real time, potential disruption to the network so they can alert passengers on delay length, giving advice on replanning journeys.

This government is making investments in Britain’s future that will deliver dividends for decades to come. Every £1 invested in R&D generates up to £7 in benefits to the UK economy and leverages double in private investment in the long run, with businesses that receive their first R&D grant funding seeing jobs and turnover go up by over 20% in the following years – providing a major boost to the UK economy. R&D is also at the heart of around 3 million jobs in the UK, with the power to create many more as discoveries advance.

The announcement comes ahead of London Tech Week, the UK’s flagship technology festival, with more expected in the coming days, as this government doubles down on plans to ensure the UK is once again open for business and setting the conditions for a decade of national renewal and the economic growth that is at the heart of our Plan for Change.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:

Britain is the home of science and technology. Through the Plan for Change, we are investing in Britain’s renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off.

Science and Technology Secretary, Peter Kyle, said:

R&D is the very foundation of the breakthroughs that make our lives easier and healthier – from new medicines enabling us to live longer, more fulfilled lives to developments in AI giving us time back, from easing our train journeys through to creating the technology we need to protect our planet from climate change.

Incredible and ambitious research goes on in every corner of our country, from Liverpool to Inverness, Swansea to Belfast, which is why empowering regions to harness local expertise and skills for all of our benefit is at the heart of this new funding – helping to deliver the economic growth at the centre of our Plan for Change.

Alongside this, nearly £5 million is being invested to kickstart a new partnership between the high-growth regions of Manchester and Cambridge, strengthening the link between these hubs of innovation to attract more business investment, and pilot new approaches to collaboration, setting examples for cities, universities and governments worldwide.

Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands, said:

This is exactly how we turn our potential into progress. This investment backs regions to lead the way in the industries that will define the future.

From life sciences and advanced manufacturing to clean energy and AI, regions across the UK have the skills and the ideas - they just need the investment and the power to match.

This will drive innovation that not only grows the economy but creates jobs, builds opportunity, improves health and changes lives.

North East Mayor Kim McGuinness said:

Our region is already an advanced manufacturing powerhouse and this announcement boosts my mission to create new growth, new jobs and new opportunities in 2 exciting ways.

We will now be able to support more research and development projects in established sectors, like the car industry and green energy, which are cornerstones of the North East economy, and we can also invest in new technologies from kitchen table innovations to our fast-emerging trailblazers in the space industry and AI.

Notes to editors

The fund would give dedicated awards of at least £30 million to each of the 7 Established Mayoral Strategic Authorities in England - Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Liverpool City Region, North East, and Greater London as well as to one equivalent region in each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be agreed with devolved governments. The fund will also include a competition, which will be open to all other parts of the UK. This will similarly support high potential innovation clusters to grow, and be based on a principle of co-creation with UKRI. This will allow us build on the strengths that we know exist across the country.

Enterprises can mix the Snowflake data platform with best-of-breed engines yet keep a single source of truth for governance.","Our research indicates that data platform wars have entered an entirely new phase, one where open data is no longer a marketing slogan and governance catalogs are now the new control point.

We see this as the first of several structural changes to the software industry. The next price of entry we think will be an emerging layer originally conceived by Geoff Moore: Systems of Intelligence, or SOIs, which we believe will become a high-value piece of real estate in the artificial intelligence-optimized software stack.

In this Breaking Analysis, and just a few days removed from Snowflake Summit 2025, we unpack how Snowflake has moved from steward of its pristine proprietary data platform to orchestrating an ecosystem in a world that enables any compute engine to operate on any open data format. Last week, we framed the company’s Rubicon moment, meaning the pivot from analytic warehouse to enabler of intelligent data apps.

Introduction

This year, Snowflake doubled down on its simplicity message, bringing that ethos into AI and, in addition and importantly, extending its governance model further into the open data ecosystem, syncing permissions with Polaris for external Iceberg tables and adding Openflow for data pipelines outside the Snowflake walled garden. Taken together, these moves signal a deliberate strategy to ease storage lock-in and let customers own and control their data independent of any compute engine – something customers are demanding – while tightening its grip on the policy and metadata control plane.

At the same time, Snowflake is bringing conversational and powerful AI and harmonizing data with a metric layer called Semantic Views to become the trusted source feeding agentic applications. As well, Snowflake is improving its engine to not only serve traditional analytic workload customers, but also improve its position for data engineering workloads and data science personas, historically challenging areas for the company.

The bottom line is that all this evolution and innovation is dragging Snowflake up into a new competitive battlefield, which we’ve often discussed in Breaking Analysis episodes. We’re not just talking about Databricks, but a spate of application vendors such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, Palantir, Celonis and others. On balance, we see tremendous opportunities for Snowflake, but these total available market expanders come with risks and key decision points for Snowflake’s future.

The north star: From dashboards to Systems of Intelligence

We believe last week’s “Crossing the Rubicon” thesis was only the prelude. Coming out of Snowflake Summit 2025, the industry is now clearly pivoting from backward-looking analytics toward fully integrated, agent-driven systems of intelligence. That shift in our view reframes every competitive debate.

In Exhibit 1 above, we show on the left side of the slide a collage of static dashboards – i.e., KPIs that show a historical view of what happened. This has been a useful tool to understand the past and help predict the future, but much more can be done in that realm.

Contrast that with the right side, which shows part of a live metric tree, a digital representation of the linked KPIs that reflect how all the processes in the enterprise are linked and drive each other. This part of the metric tree traces every stage from net-new prospect to granular lead source.

Here, metrics don’t merely describe performance; they codify cause, project impact and allow action by *adjusting* the metric-driven business drivers in the same workflow. That is the outcome we believe will become increasingly possible and define value in data platforms for the next decade.

Our belief is that Snowflake’s architectural bet is to convert openness into leverage by embracing Iceberg, courting application partners, yet keeping the governance and control inside its own service boundary. In our view, that is a viable path to defend the high ground against hyperscalers’ native Iceberg services, aggressive app vendors building their own digital twins, connector incumbents such as Fivetran and, of course, Databricks, all of which see Snowflake’s walled garden giving way to an open ecosystem.

By way of analogy, the web’s leap from brochureware to e-commerce mirrors the data world’s leap from dashboarding to operational applications. Just as the “Buy” button fused analytics with transaction flow, SoIs fuse analytics with agentic action. KPIs become control points, not just readouts, much like gauges and dials in a power plant. That meshing of analytic and operational planes is the competitive fulcrum Snowflake must navigate before rivals do.

In our opinion, Snowflake’s post-garden strategy will be judged on whether it can turn cooperative openness into durable control of the system-of-intelligence layer. An SoI emerging as a layer from a different vendor risks diminishing feature differentiation and pricing power in the underlying data platform. The chessboard is set; Databricks’ next moves in the coming week, when it will hold its annual Data+AI Summit, will give us further insight as to how the game will unfold.

Beyond read-only analytics: Closing the loop with operational applications

Last week’s “Rubicon” metaphor highlighted the point of no return; Exhibit 2 below exposes the challenges in the middle of the river. Our premise is that even if Snowflake can ingest every telemetry stream from a digital twin or other sources, the job is only half-done. The metric tree depicted below should act as a real-time control plane, detecting variance and, importantly, enabling operators or their agents to update the operational Systems of Record. Today, that round trip remains clunky, sometimes impossible. Analytic and operational applications live in hundreds or thousands of silos.

As shown above, on the right-hand side, the green arrows depict how the system-of-intelligence integrates an end-to-end representation of operations that feeds the metric tree. The system detects spikes in cost, slips in conversion rates, and lags in supply chain delivery. But the arrows that will matter most are the red ones pointing back to the SoI to update the CRM, tweak the ad budget, reschedule a shipment. Without those return arrows, the tree is just another business intelligence artifact.

In our opinion, Snowflake knows this. The company telegraphed its ambition with Unistore, yet the recent CrunchyData acquisition suggests Unistore missed the mark. Integrating analytic and operational applications requires more than adding transactions. It requires harmonizing a unified representation of operational applications, similar to but even richer than the metric layer that harmonizes analytic data.

The point we’ve made in our research over the months and years is that dashboards model the past through OLAP cubes. OLAP uplevels data from “strings” to “things.” Operations, on the other hand, are modeled through a digital twin or knowledge graph that captures entities, relationships and temporal state. It uplevels data about “activities” or business processes.

The leap from “What happened?” to “Take the optimal course of action” requires mapping OLAP cubes to the knowledge graph. Anything less forces customers into a reverse-ETL hairball that negates the very promise of a live, integrated platform.

We believe the competitive control point is shifting. It used to be the database management system that owned the data. It’s now the catalog that governs the open data formats. It will eventually be the SoI that represents a high-fidelity state of the business’s end-to-end operations.

If Snowflake can bind analytic insight directly to operational action, before Databricks or the hyperscalers do, it secures the green high ground of the System of Intelligence layer. If others layer the SoI as a new platform on top of the data platform, they will be in a position to capture more of the value that the entire stack creates.

The next land grab: Engagement, intelligence and agency

Exhibit 3 below tells the story of a harmonized data foundation supporting three interlocking tiers — Engagement, Intelligence, Agency. The middle tier, the bright-green System of Intelligence control plane, is where this architectural Rubicon turns both exciting and potentially dangerous.

At the core of the diagram above sits a digital twin, which represents an always-on, 4-D map of every customer, part, order, policy, process and exception in an enterprise. The SoI treats the business logic previously in application silos as a harmonized corporate asset just as valuable as the data enterprises have been managing for decades. Building an integrated business model has been a false Grail for decades. But we believe this time Systems of Agency will help build it – a topic to be explored in future reports.

The analytic presentation of the data in the SoI may still be summarized in cubes of metrics and dimensions. But that analytic data must still be integrated bidirectionally with the richer operational representation in the knowledge graph. Sitting on top are human-supervised agents that interrogate the SoI (“Why is pipeline velocity sagging?”) and invoke recommended remediations into customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning or supply-chain apps through the SoI. The agents bypass the siloed business logic in the legacy Systems of Record, or SoR, and only the transaction logic preserves low-level integrity.

We believe this SoI, shaded in green above, is the most valuable real estate in the modern stack. In the age of AI, how you model your business “programs” your AI-driven agents. Vendors that master it may disintermediate traditional SoRs and data platforms.

[Listen to how JP Morgan Chase built an early example of a high-value SoI layer on top of Snowflake]

The strategic stakes follow classic platform economics. Let’s call it platform envelopment. When a new layer emerges, incumbents below risk commoditization unless they move up the stack or tether upper-layer innovation tightly to their core. In the procedural era, compute was the infrastructure, the app server the platform.

In today’s data-centric era, data is the infrastructure, the model is the platform, and agents are the applications. The vendor that binds those layers with a coherent, governed control plane will dictate the cadence of enterprise AI for the next decade.

This is key to why we talked about that trolling between Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Nadella was saying the systems of agency will talk directly to the CRUD databases below the systems of record. He’s trying to say software as a service will go away, because he’s not that competitive there. But we’re saying there’s going to be many layers in between to mediate all that, and that’s why we see vendors that are building that System of Intelligence having a critical advantage.

Snowflake’s post-summit blueprint: TAM expansion to more workloads or owning the stack?

Snowflake’s 2025 Summit unleashed a mini-re:Invent torrent of features. We’ve tried to distill those announcements into the reference diagram shown below in Exhibit 4 and map them to our model of the future software stack. Generally, we see an architecture that aligns with the engagement-intelligence-agency model we laid out earlier, with some key questions.

In the picture above, we show four functional areas, including Snowflake’s natural language query capability in purple, Snowflake Intelligence, which can tap both structured and unstructured data.

Cortex Agents (yellow, top). Snowflake’s orchestration layer where specialized agents work with different workloads, including structured and unstructured data. This is Snowflake’s first toe in the water on the system-of-agency tier.

Semantic Views + Embedding and Search Services. Semantic Views translate raw operational data into metrics and dimensions, giving agents a business vocabulary beyond SQL. Embedding and search and reranking services extend the Snowflake platform into unstructured data.

Horizon + Polaris Bridge (orange). Governance extended to open-table formats—Snowflake’s answer to “policy once, query many” across native and Iceberg data while defending its performance moat.

Adaptive Compute and Gen 2. Adaptive compute means transparent sizing (no more T-shirt sizes). Faster, smarter scheduling and routing. Gen 2 – Roughly 1.3X more expensive with the promise of up to 2X+ the performance – leading to overall better TCO. Key to “may the best engine win” in a world that is increasingly “Iceberg-ized.”

Open Compute Layer. External engines – e.g. Spark, Trino, Presto and the like, letting customers work on Iceberg tables with their choice of engine.

AI SQL extends the familiar SQL programming model to large language model-based functions. Openflow manages data pipelines that were previously outside of Snowflake’s reach. This means an expanded TAM beyond the walled garden by extending governance and control.

Our take. In an open-data era the customer, not the DBMS, owns the data, so engines must fight for every workload on two axes: 1) Best-of-breed capability; and 2) Synergistic integration. Snowflake is clearly leaning into the second lever with tight coupling of governance, semantics and AI agents to make “using it together” the path of least resistance. Whether that synergy offsets specialized engine competition will define how much of the orange data platform real estate Snowflake ultimately captures.

Notwithstanding the near-term competition from other engines that open table formats enable, the long-term battle, we believe, will be leveraging the 4-D map of an enterprise, comprising people, places, things and processes. Importantly, the process data will be the most elusive for data platform providers as the likes of Celonis, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP and other application providers will protect that turf and potentially restrict easy access to data platform providers – trying to relegate them to data infrastructure versus the brain of an enterprise. Blue Yonder, the supply chain vendor, is building a system-of-intelligence along with a system-of-agency on top of Snowflake using the RelationalAI knowledge graph to harmonize and represent end-to-end operations.

Snowflake’s AI application framework: Where it shines and where the gaps remain

Exhibit 5 below lays out Snowflake’s bid to climb the value stack. We show a guided flow that starts with governed data, runs through multimodal processing and retrieval, and culminates in Cortex-driven agents that interact with end-user applications. In our view, the design goal is to guarantee trust and compliance at ingestion, enrich context, and let agents execute multistep playbooks, while observability, lineage, and policy metadata track every action to enable improvement and trust.

Below is a scorecard that maps the framework’s key layers to Snowflake’s current strengths and the open issues that could invite competition:

Why this matters. In an open-data world, the locus of control shifts from owning the database to owning data governance. Snowflake’s current edge lies in the synergy of governance + data semantics + AI orchestration, a combination that leverages Snowflake’s simplicity mantra. The risk is that if richer Graph RAG search or SoIs (knowledge graphs) for harmonizing the operational application estate emerge as best-of-breed alternatives, agents will gravitate to these external services as part of a new control plane.

A key open question is how far up the stack Snowflake is willing to go, in particular with the 4-D map we often discuss. Its relationship with RelationalAI is a potential linchpin. Today, Snowflake is an analytic data platform. RelationalAI can turn it into a System of Intelligence. If Blue Yonder lives up to its promises, it will be one of the most advanced proof points that Snowflake can host Systems of Intelligence and Agency. Success here and its ability to attract other ISVs will be critical to determining whether Snowflake is relegated to data infrastructure and will serve the SoI layer, or control it outright.

The UX battleground: Semantic views vs. generative front ends

We believe one of Snowflake’s other hurdles is the “talk-to-your-data” promise. Snowflake Intelligence has been one of the company’s “tentpole” initiatives. Working with data is moving from business analysts to every knowledge worker, and that shift elevates the system-of-engagement layer, where nexgen BI vendors such as Hex, Sigma and others are racing to wrap generative user interface around trusted semantic models. We don’t believe this will remain a specialized niche. Microsoft Research has shown a generative UX for interacting with BI. And we believe Tableau will unveil a re-architected BI tool that better embraces a generative UX at Dreamforce this fall.

Exhibit 6 above is instructive. It takes a screenshot from Hex with a prompt of “Give me revenue by movie genre.” A single natural-language query first surfaces already built interactive visualizations – no SQL, no manual chart-building. We highlight in the top red box the natural language query. The intermediate three recommended relevant visualizations are returned by Hex. The bottom red box offers the option to generate a completely new visualization.

Exhibit 7 above shows the next visualization that Hex automatically generates when the user chooses a new exploration as opposed to an existing one. Not only does it generate a rich visualization, but the user can interact with it in natural language. It showcases what enterprise users will soon deem table stakes, thanks to their daily experiences with these next-gen tools.

Execution risks on the UX front

The critical point in the exhibits is that Hex and other specialized tools will probably be able to use their own agents and widgets behind the scenes to generate a richer UX than any data platform vendor. The data platform vendor will own the semantic model of the data. In fact, Hex already supports Snowflake Semantic Views.

Implications. Snowflake can afford to cede certain ground to best-of-breed UX vendors, provided its semantic layer remains the single source of governed truth and captures interaction data so that it can continually improve. The payoff is that every generative AI dashboard or chat interface built on top of Snowflake semantics amplifies its value and further secures its moat, nudging enterprises to centralize even more data under the platform’s policy umbrella.

The risk is equally clear: if independent software vendors use alternative semantic models and third-party search services, such as Glean or Microsoft Copilot 365, Snowflake becomes just another data lakehouse. Then it will compete more on cost and performance instead of commanding more of the emerging green System of Intelligence control-plane real estate.

Execution scorecard: Users now expect a chat prompt to return a polished visualization and narrative in one shot. Snowflake’s early “Intelligence” demo showcases the concept, but BI partners have more advanced technology here. To stay relevant, Snowflake’s semantic views must learn from users interacting with third-party BI tools. Snowflake’s Cortex agents must also enable these richer tools.

Bottom line. The generative engagement layer is where user loyalty is forged. In our opinion, Snowflake must double down on making its semantic views the indisputable single source of governed context, then let the BI ecosystem run wild on UI innovation.

Reading the ETR tea leaves: Who owns the BI mindshare?

Our latest Enterprise Technology Research snapshot shown below in Exhibit 8, maps spending velocity (shared net score, Y-axis) against account penetration (X-axis) for a handful of BI vendors. The picture reinforces that mindshare goes to those with broad account penetration but but innovation can still upset the balance.

Data caveat: This is meant only to be representative and mixes three ETR sectors, including Analytics, BI and Big Data. It is not precisely representative of pure-play BI vendors in all cases.

Microsoft’s gravity well. By virtue of Office 365 bundling (and an aggressive Power BI land-and-expand motion), Microsoft sits in the chart’s northeast quadrant, deeply penetrated and still showing elevated spend momentum. For enterprise buyers, adopting the built-in tool often feels like a default, not a decision.

Looker’s altitude vs. Tableau’s breadth. Google’s Looker scores higher on the velocity axis, signaling healthy momentum even though its installed base remains narrower than Tableau’s. Tableau, for its part, enjoys broad deployment but only middling Net Score lift, which provides evidence that Salesforce has yet to reignite growth in what was once the category’s innovation engine.

ThoughtSpot’s puzzling dip. Previous surveys showed ThoughtSpot punching above its weight in momentum; its current low reading raises questions about go-to-market execution or simply sample noise. Worth watching, because its search-first UX concept dovetails with the generative wave.

Qlik as context, not contender. Qlik now focuses on data integration and Talend-driven pipelines; its BI heritage keeps it in the mix, but it is no longer the competitive benchmark for next-gen engagement layers.

Hex and Sigma: Data TBD, ambition clear. ETR hasn’t yet captured statistically significant reads on these up-and-comers, but the anecdotal buzz is encouraging. Both vendors wrap natural-language prompts around governed semantic models; and Sigma’s early experiments in collaborative write-back hint at the very control-loop capabilities we’ve argued are essential for a true System of Engagement.

Strategic takeaway. Today’s BI tools still function primarily as read-only presentation layers. The first crack in that facade is Sigma enabling forecast data collection and reverse-ETL write-back. Snowflake and Databricks are reacting by embedding Postgres to capture lightweight transactions on-cluster, a move that edges them closer to operational interlock but still stops short of updating core SaaS or ERP systems directly.

In our view, the vendor that marries high account penetration with seamless, governed write-back will seize the engagement layer; and by extension add value to the wider System of Intelligence agenda. Microsoft’s scale gives it a head start, but the field remains open for a specialist that can prove both velocity and precision without sacrificing governance.

Horizon and Polaris: Snowflake’s bid to govern the open frontier

Open-table momentum has swung from curiosity to imperative. By federating its proprietary Horizon catalog with the open-source Polaris REST catalog spec for Apache Iceberg, Snowflake is attempting the most consequential move since first pledging Iceberg support in 2022. The blue-box architecture shown below in Exhibit 9 conveys that Horizon remains the nucleus for privacy, lineage and policy management, while Polaris starts to extend those controls to any Spark, Trino or Flink job running on external Iceberg tables. Permissions and policies flow outward to the external data. Our premise is this preserves Snowflake’s governance moat even as compute becomes a free-for-all.

This matters for three reasons:

Control-point shift. In the open-data era the buyer owns the data. The technology vendor that defines and enforces policy owns the trusted relationship. By synchronizing catalogs, Snowflake moves that control point up the stack while expanding to data it didn’t manage previously.

Any engine, same rules. Enterprises can mix the Snowflake data platform with best-of-breed engines yet keep a single source of truth for governance.

Competitive test. The onus now falls on rivals – especially Databricks this coming week – to match or exceed the Polaris spec. Unity Catalog can read Iceberg today but still lags on write and bidirectional policy propagation. One would expect that to change this month. Adoption decisions in the next release cycle will reveal whether the ecosystem coalesces around a shared governance API or fractures into vendor-specific silos.

Our take: Horizon-to-Polaris is a calculated bet to embrace openness while cementing Snowflake’s role as the policy root of trust. Success hinges on both richer Horizon metadata that keeps ahead of external catalogs; and flawless propagation that proves governance is consistent, irrespective of where the data lives or which engine touches it. If Snowflake executes, it retains the high ground in the age of Iceberg; if it stumbles, or competition out markets them, the control plane shifts to whoever can become the open-source data governance steward.

Pipeline wars reignited: Can Snowflake recapture data engineering workloads?

Our research indicates that another front in Snowflake’s battle is not simply about smarter insights or richer governance, it is about reclaiming the ingest-and-transform pipelines that have quietly (or not so quietly) bled to cheaper Spark engines over the past two years. Exhibit 10 below lays out the piece parts of its strategy as we see it. It comprises Gen2 Warehouses, Adaptive Compute and the new Openflow control plane form the basis of Snowflake’s strategy to go hard after these workloads. As well, we believe there is a new pricing tier for lower-value batch workloads, but have not 100% confirmed this as fact.

Why it matters. A digital twin is only as good as the freshness, lineage and cost profile of its source data. When Instacart famously shifted high-volume ETL jobs to Databricks, its Snowflake bill reportedly fell by more than half. That move also siphoned off critical lineage metadata, weakening Snowflake’s ability to assert Horizon as the single source of governance truth. The lesson to Snowflake was: Lose the upstream pipelines and the downstream control plane eventually fragments.

Snowflake’s playbook

Openflow (powered by NiFi) is positioned as more than an ingestion tool; it is the policy-aware conduit that ties source-system lineage directly into the Horizon | Polaris framework. If successful, every bit arriving via Openflow carries built-in permissions and provenance, preserving the governance envelope from origin to agentic action.

Gen2 Warehouses pledge ~2.1X query throughput, to offset about a 30% higher credit price. For data engineering workloads that are throughput-sensitive but latency-tolerant, the math must net out in favor of total cost of ownership; otherwise Spark will remain the rational choice.

Adaptive Compute eliminates T-shirt-sizing guesswork, auto-scaling clusters up and down so engineers don’t overprovision for peak. It mirrors capabilities Oracle has long touted and neutralizes a frequent competitive talking point.

Dynamic Tables and enhanced Snowpipe Streaming aim to blend incremental views with volume-based pricing. We’re still awaiting final confirmation, but his would be attractive for low latency change data capture pipelines.

What Snowflake must still prove. Open benchmarks against Databricks, Fivetran-run ingest pipelines and other open compute stacks will determine whether Gen2 truly wins on price-performance for data engineering. Just as importantly, the company must convince data-engineering teams that moving or retaining pipelines inside Snowflake adds net value — via simpler lineage capture, unified policy enforcement and lower operational friction — without locking them into a premium compute tax.

In our opinion, the stakes are quite high. If Snowflake pulls more data engineering back under Horizon’s umbrella, its governance moat becomes self-reinforcing. If it fails, customers will route lineage through Unity or another external catalog, diluting Snowflake’s control plane to just one of many metadata hubs in a multi-engine world.

Connector reality check: Can Openflow close the ingest gap?

The fact of a digital-twin initiative requires a rich, real-time event stream with hundreds of battle-tested pipelines that keep pace via connectors to external application and data sources. A leader in the field today is Fivetran along with a handful of startups and, of course, legacy ETL players who have spent a decade hardening their connectors against schema drift, rate-limit problems and authentication quirks.

Exhibit 11 below shows an example of the immaturity of Snowflake’s offering compared to Fivetran’s hardened solution. On the left, you see Snowflake’s own docs spelling out connector limitations to Jira. For example, single-threaded Jira pulls, basic auth only, no delete tracking. Contrast that with the schema richness in the middle, showing FiveTran’s battle-tested map of the same source. That visual alone tells you which player has more battle scars.

Snowflake’s Openflow is derived from its Datavolo acquisition. The strategic risk is if Fivetran manages ingest for critical SaaS data to Iceberg, some of the authoritative lineage and therefore policy control may migrate outside Horizon’s purview.

Catching up is a two-front campaign:

Connector breadth and durability. Building and maintaining hundreds of high-fidelity connectors is an evergreen grind. Snowflake must accelerate with prebuilt kits, joint engineering programs or even further M&A to close the gap Fivetran, Informatica and others enjoy.

Low-code transformation authoring. Openflow’s NiFi-based engine promises drag-and-drop pipeline design, but the market is moving toward metadata-driven, AI-assisted pipeline generation. Salesforce’s $8 billion bet on Informatica raises the stakes where low-code isn’t a feature, rather it’s table stakes for harnessing legacy data at scale.

Until Snowflake proves parity on both fronts, the governance narrative remains susceptible to attack. Horizon’s policy graph is only as complete as the data it ingests; a fragmented ingest layer would hand rival catalogs – Unity or otherwise – the opportunity to assert themselves as the true system of record.

The new battlefield: Who commands the System of Intelligence high ground?

Exhibit 11 below widens the lens beyond Snowflake’s roadmap to a subset of the cast of rivals now eyeing the green System of Intelligence band. Once you declare ambitions to own this layer, you step onto a proving ground already filled with well-funded incumbents like SAP with Business Data Cloud, Salesforce with Data Cloud, ServiceNow with Workflow Data Fabric, Celonis with process mining, Microsoft and Oracle with decades of application context, and niche innovators (and Snowflake partners) such as RelationalAI and Blue Yonder, weaving graph semantics directly into decision automation.

Our research indicates that the SoI is the linchpin of modern enterprise architecture because agents are only as smart as the state of the business represented in the knowledge graph. If a platform controls that graph, it becomes the default policymaker for “why is this happening, what comes next, and what should we do?” In that world, the yellow System of Agency tier (the orchestration logic for those agents) naturally gravitates toward the same vendor, cementing a feedback loop of data, context and action.

Snowflake and Databricks still dominate the orange analytics foundation, but they must now elevate into the green zone without triggering a frontal assault from application giants that view the same territory as their destiny. Cortex is Snowflake’s opening gambit; Databricks will answer at its summit this coming week. The outcome will determine who writes the rules of engagement and who settles for plumbing-level margins in an increasingly open, Iceberg-driven data economy.

In short, crossing the Rubicon is not merely about exposing Iceberg tables or adding write-back support, it is about marching an army into new territory already patrolled by SAP, Salesforce, ServiceNow and Microsoft. Whoever maps the richest, most dynamic enterprise knowledge graph will program the next decade of AI agents, relegating others else to more commodity-like infrastructure beneath the green bar.

Market momentum reality check

The latest ETR XY snapshot (spending velocity on the Y-axis, account penetration on the X-axis) is shown below in Exhibit 12. It reminds us that architectural ambition has to land inside real budgets with technology buyers.

Microsoft sits in its normal position, the northeast corner. It’s products are ubiquitous with sustained spend momentum. Power BI rides inside M365 and benefits from its accelerating Copilot push.

Amazon Web Services isn’t far behind, buoyed by SageMaker, Bedrock and the new Q natural-language layer, signaling it will monetize AI higher up the stack.

Salesforce enjoys broad presence but middling velocity; execution hinges on turning Data Cloud and Agentforce (along with Slack, Tableau, Mulesoft, etc.) into a cohesive SoI rather than a bundle of piece parts.

ServiceNow owns its service-workflow domain and is quietly wiring a knowledge graph beneath it. While it has a smaller footprint in the survey, it has big leverage in its installed base.

Google Cloud shows improving momentum post-Next and I/O announcements; Vertex plus Gemini integrations are starting to resonate with customers and partners.

Oracle and IBM rank low on account momentum but have large installed bases, a value play and remain cash machines where they land. Both firms pursue differentiated data plays. Oracle is more vertically integrated while IBM is going after a data integration opportunity across hybrid estates. Both have AI plays that escape pure XY optics in the ETR data set.

SAP retains deep SoR entrenchment and is now layering Business Data Cloud as its bid for the SoI slot.

Snowflake and Databricks remain twin pillars of the analytic-infrastructure layer; each must now prove it can climb into the green SoI band without alienating partners. Or perhaps choose to participate as the world’s best data infrastructure.

Palantir and Celonis punch above their weight in spend velocity. Palantir is focused on its domain graphs while Celonis is trying to be the Switzerland of data harmonization and agentic control.

Closing perspective

Our research indicates that the industry is decisively moving beyond static dashboards and walled gardens toward an agent-driven future where value accrues to whoever commands the rich, governed knowledge graph at the heart of the enterprise. Snowflake’s Horizon/Polaris bridge, Gen2 warehouse, Cortex agents and Openflow pipelines are strong moves to capture that ground, but they also invite direct confrontation with application giants and hyperscalers who eye the same prize.

In our opinion, the winners over the next decade will be those who can: 1) Guarantee high quality data harmonization and governance across open data; 2) Deliver price-competitive pipelines that keep metadata in-house; and 3) Build a dynamic system of intelligence that agents can trust and act upon in real time. Everyone else risks relegation to lower-value plumbing in an increasingly open, Iceberg-native world. Still a good business but it won’t command the highest valuations in our view.

The Rubicon is in sight. Cross it with caution and a strong position and embark on a campaign to secure the high ground.

Adjustable Dumbbells,” and the “BowFlex 1090, 90-lb.
Adjustable Dumbbells,” the commission said.
BowFlex assets that included those dumbbells were acquired by Johnson Health Tech Retail, a subsidiary of Johnson Health Tech, in 2024, after BowFlex declared bankruptcy that year.
According to Consumer Reports, this is not the first time that BowFlex has had issues with its adjustable dumbbells.","The exercise equipment brand BowFlex recalled millions of its adjustable dumbbells because of the risk of metal plates dislodging from the product’s handle and hitting people during weight lifting.

Concussions, abrasions, broken toes and contusions are among the 111 reports of injuries caused by the plates dislodging, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Thursday. More than 300 reports of plates coming off had been filed with the company that used to own the brand, the agency said.

The more than 3.8 million recalled units are from the models marketed as the “BowFlex 552, 52.5-lb. Adjustable Dumbbells,” and the “BowFlex 1090, 90-lb. Adjustable Dumbbells,” the commission said.

Johnson Health Tech Trading, the company that owns the trademark rights to market and sell the adjustable dumbbells, said in a statement that it issued the voluntary recall in cooperation with the safety commission to enhance customer protection, even though most of the dumbbells were sold under Nautilus, a defunct company that was the previous owner of the BowFlex products.

“Despite having no obligation to do so, Johnson Health Tech Trading is stepping up to provide a remedy to customers who purchased recalled dumbbells from Nautilus,” said the statement, adding the company will also be responsive to customers with recalled dumbbells “that our company distributed or sold.”

The model 552 dumbbells adjust from five to 52.5 pounds, while the model 1090 adjusts from 10 to 90 pounds. They are black dumbbells with handles that were sold in pairs and single units, and came with weights with handles, weight plates and a molded plastic trays, the commission said.

Consumers are urged to immediately stop using the dumbbells and seek a refund.

The dumbbells were sold in stores, including Best Buy, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Johnson Fitness & Wellness, as well as online on Amazon and the BowFlex website. They sold for between $200 and $800, the commission said.

The popular dumbbell models, one of which was a previous Wirecutter pick, allow people to weight train at home without dealing with the bulk of owning a full set of traditional dumbbells.

Johnson Health Tech Trading, which is part of the company that owns the BowFlex brand products in the recall, will replace the dumbbells for customers who purchased the items from April 23, 2024, through May 2025, or refund them the price of the equipment with a voucher, the commission said.

BowFlex assets that included those dumbbells were acquired by Johnson Health Tech Retail, a subsidiary of Johnson Health Tech, in 2024, after BowFlex declared bankruptcy that year.

Customers who purchased the dumbbells from BowFlex, formerly known as Nautilus, before April 23, 2024, can request a refund that will come in the form of a prorated voucher, according to BowFlex. All customers affected by the recall are eligible to receive a one-year digital fitness membership, the company said.

Johnson Health Tech Trading also said that it has developed “new and improved versions” of the 552 and 1090 dumbbells that it will make available for purchase at an unspecified date.

Gabe Knight, a senior policy analyst on the safety policy team for the nonprofit Consumer Reports, which tests products and rates them, called the company’s solution to the recall inadequate. “Consumers should be able to receive their money back in full, no strings attached,” she said.

According to Consumer Reports, this is not the first time that BowFlex has had issues with its adjustable dumbbells.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/07/multimedia/07xp-bowflex-sdiu/07xp-bowflex-sdiu-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 20:01:12.409976

While McDonald’s fans are waiting for the return of their famous Snack Wrap, Popeyes has launched a new addition that's causing a sensation. The competition to win over fried chicken lovers is more alive than ever in the United States.

On Monday, June 2, Popeyes announced the addition of their new Chicken Wraps, available nationwide for a limited time. This offering arrives just before the desired return of McDonald’s Snack Wrap, scheduled for July 10. This way, Popeyes is taking the opportunity to offer a fresh and different alternative to their customers.

Chicken wraps: Popeyes's winning bet

The new Chicken Wraps from Popeyes are a generous and carefully crafted version of the classic chicken wrap. For just $3.99, customers can choose from three bold flavors: Classic, Spicy, or Honey Mustard. Each wrap contains tender, hand-breaded, and crispy chicken, accompanied by fresh lettuce, shredded cheese, and crunchy pickles.

What truly sets this offering apart is the tortilla inspired by Popeyes's famous biscuits. Amy Alarcon, vice president of culinary innovation, explained in a statement, ""We've taken our chicken tenders and wrapped them in something new, with that irresistible crunch in a portable form."" She also added that ""infusing the flavors of our biscuit into the wraps was the perfect way to make sure our signature flavors shined.""

This launch is not just about a new product, but a clear commitment to keep Popeyes's unique identity in every bite. The chain is betting that this launch will win over both their loyal customers and those looking for something different in the world of fast food, reports New York Post.

Innovative drinks to accompany the experience

In addition to the new wrap, Popeyes has expanded their drink menu with a fresh and fruity touch. Inspired by the viral success of their Pickle Lemonade, they now present Blueberry Lemonade in two versions: cold or frozen, both for $3.99. They are also adding two blueberry teas, one sweetened with cane sugar and one unsweetened, available for $2.99.

This line of drinks reinforces Popeyes's intention to offer not just food, but a complete and distinctive experience. The combination of citrus and fruit flavors is designed to attract both young customers and those looking for refreshing options.

McDonald’s launched their McCrispy Strips in April and continues preparing for the return of the Snack Wrap. Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, stated that these chicken strips will ""eventually allow us to have a McCrispy Snack Wrap.""

NatWest’s mobile app is back up and running after service issues left its customers unable to log in for several hours on Friday.

The bank said it had fixed the problems and apologised to users who were unable to view or make payments.

A spokeswoman for the bank said: “NatWest customers experienced difficulty accessing our mobile app today.

“We have resolved the issues causing this and customers are now able to log in and make payments as normal.

“We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused.”

More than 3,000 outages were reported through services monitoring site Downdetector at about 10am on Friday.

And many more could have been affected by the outage across the approximately ten million customers who use the mobile app to access their bank accounts every day.

Disgruntled customers took to social media site X to express their frustration over the outage, which has left them unable to send or receive money through the app.

Several users said they could not pay bills, send wages or transfer funds between accounts on Friday morning.

NatWest reassured customers the issue stemmed from an update it made to the app on Thursday, after some customers raised concerns over recent major cyber hacks affecting Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.

It also urged people to use online or telephone banking, or visit a branch, while it was trying to fix the issues.

High street banks have been in the firing line over a string of outages that have affected customers, particularly around the end of month when it is typically pay day for many households.

Data gathered by the Treasury Committee in March found there had been more than 33 days’ worth of unplanned tech and system outages in the last two years for nine of the UK’s biggest banks and building societies.

NatWest had 13 “material” incidents between 2023 and 2025, paying nearly £350,000 in compensation for customers who complained, it told the committee.

Barclays said it could pay up to £12.5 million in compensation for millions of customers affected over the period.

Common reasons given for the incidents include problems with third-party suppliers, disruption caused when systems were changed, and internal software malfunctions.

Jenny Ross, money editor for consumer champion Which?, said: “Banks are encouraging more and more of us to rely on apps to do our essential banking, so when these go down it can be devastating.

“In the worst cases there’s a risk that impacted NatWest customers may miss important bill payments, find themselves unable to pay for essential services or risk going overdrawn – issues which could come with knock-on effects like late payment or overdraft penalties, or affect their ability to get credit or borrow money.

“NatWest must ensure customers are kept updated and are swiftly compensated where appropriate.

“Anyone affected should keep evidence of impacted payments in case they need to make a claim, and if you think you’ll be unable to pay a bill, contact the company involved as soon as possible to ensure they’re aware and waive any late payment fees.”

The Country Manager of Roche Diagnostics Africa, Roberto Taboada, said in a statement that the move was “a significant step towards achieving sustainable healthcare transformation in Nigeria”.

The move, according to him, aligns with the company’s 10-year diagnostics strategy for Africa, which aims to increase access to in vitro diagnostics tenfold.

“This expansion aligns with Roche’s 10-year diagnostics strategy for Africa. Africa, home to 54 countries and over 1.5 billion people, bears 25 per cent of the global health burden but receives only one per cent of the global health budget and is served by just three per cent of the global health workforce,” he said.

Taboada explained that the newly launched Nigerian entity would serve as a regional hub for Roche’s operations across Anglophone West Africa, ensuring faster access to its diagnostics solutions.

“This will enable us to engage directly with our customers, strengthen our partnerships with healthcare providers, improve supply chain efficiency and ultimately support Nigeria’s journey to universal health coverage,” he said.

Director of Strategy and Innovation, Africa, Roche Diagnostics, Jonathan Keytel, noted that Nigeria remains a critical partner in the firm’s long-term vision for healthcare on the continent.

“Nigeria is a critical partner in Roche’s mission to deliver better health outcomes through diagnostic innovation,” he said.

Keytel said that the company’s 10x strategy is anchored on organisational growth, increased access to diagnostics, and innovative business models tailored to African realities.

“The newly launched Nigerian affiliate is expected to bring Roche closer to its customers and partners, improving logistics, supply chains, and turnaround times,” he said.

He noted that the presence of Roche in Nigeria would facilitate faster diagnoses and earlier treatments, which would, in turn, improve outcomes for patients and reduce costs for the healthcare system.

“Our presence here is about building resilient health systems. It’s about working with Nigerians to co-create solutions that work for Nigeria. What succeeds in Europe or the United States might not work here, but together, we can innovate in ways that truly meet local needs,” he added.

For the second consecutive year, APSEZ secured the top spot in the Environment dimension in the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).
Further recognition came from CDP, which awarded APSEZ an “A-” rating in both climate change and water security assessments for 2024.

This milestone reflects APSEZ’s unwavering commitment to sustainable operations and environmental stewardship.

“The initiative underscores APSEZ’s proactive approach to tackling all types of waste and minimizing landfill contributions. Over the past year, the company has successfully recycled, reused, or repurposed nearly 300 tons of plastic waste – equivalent to the weight of approximately 100 elephants,” said the flagship company of the Adani Group.

As part of its broader sustainability roadmap, APSEZ has set an ambitious target to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040. The company has already commissioned 225 MW of renewable energy capacity, reinforcing its dedication to clean energy and climate action.

In parallel, APSEZ is also committed to implementing nature-based solutions for climate mitigation. The Company has successfully forested 4,240 hectares of mangroves and conserved additional 2,915 hectares that act as carbon sink and safeguard local communities against extreme weather events.

APSEZ’s efforts have not gone unnoticed on the global stage. For the second consecutive year, APSEZ secured the top spot in the Environment dimension in the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).

In overall ESG rating, the company ranked among the top 10 global transportation and infrastructure firms, with a score of 68 out of 100 – a three-point improvement from the previous year – placing it in the 97th percentile of its sector.

Further recognition came from CDP, which awarded APSEZ an “A-” rating in both climate change and water security assessments for 2024.

Notably, this marks the company’s first entry into the leadership band for water security.

Sustainalytics also reaffirmed APSEZ’s leadership in the port sector, assigning it the top rank in low carbon transition rating, indicating the alignment of the company’s projected greenhouse gases emissions with the global net zero target.

On overall ESG risk, Sustainalytics has assigned a low-risk rating of 13.7 to APSEZ placing it among the top ten in marine ports sector.

The company’s strong ESG performance has earned it a place in the Nifty 100 ESG Index and a ‘Prime’ status from ISS ESG – a distinction that qualifies its equity and bond instruments for responsible investment portfolios.

In a collaborative push toward industrial decarbonization, the Adani Mundra Cluster – comprising APSEZ Mundra Port, Adani New Industries Ltd., and Ambuja Cements Ltd. – has joined the World Economic Forum’s ‘Transitioning Industrial Clusters’ initiative, aimed at achieving net-zero emissions for the Cluster by 2050.

Now the wait is over: The chain confirmed that the Snack Wrap is making a permanent return nationwide on July 10, 2025.

From Fan Petition to Boardroom: Demand That Wouldn’t Quit

View this post on Instagram

A post shared by McDonald’s (@mcdonalds)

When McDonald’s R&D teams tallied the numbers, they saw 19,000 petition signatures, millions of social video views, and steady drive-thru requests for an item employees could no longer ring up. Company president Joe Erlinger calls the comeback “a testament” to listening to fans, publicly answering with the now-viral statement, “It’s back. 7.10.25.”

Why McDonald’s Pulled the Snack Wrap in 2016

The original wrap — featuring grilled or crispy chicken, lettuce, shredded cheese, and ranch — met consumer tastes but clogged production lines. As late-night orders piled in, assembling made-to-order wraps slowed kitchens that were calibrated for burgers and fries. Ultimately, operational complexity, not sales, doomed the product.

Operations 2.0: Making the Wrap Kitchen-Friendly Again

This time, engineers redesigned the menu item to maintain the speed of service. First came McCrispy Strips, a peppery, all-white-meat strip that fries in the same vats as nuggets, limiting new equipment needs. Launched nationally in May, the strip now forms the Snack Wrap’s core. Second, new tortillas, staging racks, and concise build steps were rolled into crew training at 13,500 U.S. restaurants.

“With this being one of our most highly anticipated menu items, we knew we had one chance to knock it out of the park. It had to be easy for crew to execute,” Erlinger says, according to The Associated Press.

A Strategic Play for Value-Seeking and Health-Mindful Diner

At roughly half the price of a premium sandwich combo, the Snack Wrap targets inflation-weary guests trading down or skipping visits altogether. It’s approximately 300 calories (exact nutrition to be posted closer to launch); also, they check the “better-for-you” box for consumers who might otherwise bypass quick-service aisles.

“I’m not actually a fast-food fan, but Snack Wraps felt different, like I was eating an actual ‘wrap.’ I felt like I was being healthier,” Florida counselor Steve Davis, who once bought six grilled wraps at a time for meal prep, said.

Positioning in the Intensifying Fast-Food Chicken Wars

Chicken is where the growth is: U.S. chicken sales nearly double beef and are accelerating faster globally. Rivals smell opportunity.

Popeyes rolled out its own Chicken Wrap a day before McDonald’s announcement and immediately lobbed social-media shade, while Burger King and Wendy’s launched their versions last year. Even convenience chain Wawa is pushing handheld chicken. By reclaiming its trailblazing wrap, McDonald’s aims to defend its share and remind customers it can still set, not just follow, poultry trends.

What’s Inside the New Permanent Snack Wrap Lineup

Beginning July 10, guests can order Snack Wraps à la carte or in a two-wrap combo with fries and a drink:

Ranch Snack Wrap: McCrispy Strip, shredded lettuce, cheddar-jack cheese, classic buttermilk ranch with garlic and onion notes, served on a flour tortilla.

Spicy Snack Wrap: Same build, finished with a habanero-forward spicy sauce inspired by the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.

Each wrap leverages identical SKUs across kitchens, part of the operational streamlining that green-lit the comeback.

Digital Hype: The Snack Wrap Files

To keep momentum sizzling, McDonald’s launched “The Snack Wrap Files,” an interactive microsite featuring archival ads, fan stories, and a countdown clock. Expect limited-edition merch drops and AR filters designed for TikTok and Instagram — the channels that helped fuel the product’s renaissance.

Measuring Success After Launch Day

Unlike “limited-time only” plays, McDonald’s pledges the Snack Wrap is “back for good, as long as you keep enjoying it.” Internal KPIs will focus on incrementality:

Incremental traffic from value and snack occasions.

Attachment rate (next-best item purchased with a wrap).

Kitchen throughput (seconds per car in drive-thru).

Digital engagement on the Snack Wrap Files hub.

If metrics hit, analysts predict the wrap could contribute up to 2 percentage points of U.S. same-store sales in H2 2025 — no small feat for a single SKU.",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Inside-McDonalds-Decision-to-Bring-Back-Snack-Wraps-for-Good.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 19:04:04.093396

“Closures of major chain pharmacies often create ripple effects across the community,” E. Michael Murphy, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at The Ohio State University, told Nexstar via email.
Shuttering pharmacies in larger cities, like New York City and Philadelphia, may have limited impacts.
In addition to filling prescriptions, pharmacies are able to provide vaccines, chronic disease management, urgent consultations, over-the-counter treatments, and certain health tests.
He went on to explain that while online pharmacies can help fill the void of shuttered drugstores, they’re largely unable to accommodate the additional services pharmacies provide.","(NEXSTAR) — Several retail pharmacy chains have shuttered some of their stores this year, with more on the way for others, like Rite Aid, which filed for bankruptcy in May. It could create what some refer to as “pharmacy deserts,” areas in which drugstores and the additional services they provide may not be available for miles. And in areas where other pharmacies are picking up the slack, it could have an impact on current customers.

“Closures of major chain pharmacies often create ripple effects across the community,” E. Michael Murphy, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at The Ohio State University, told Nexstar via email.

Nearby pharmacies, independent or part of a chain, can see “a sudden increase in patients,” he explained, which could “lead to longer lines, and increase strain on the health care team.”

It could also disrupt your medical care.

Shuttering pharmacies in larger cities, like New York City and Philadelphia, may have limited impacts. Take, for example, a Rite Aid located in Philadelphia that has been designated for closure. A three-minute walk down the road will take you to a Walgreens and a local pharmacy.

Within smaller communities, that may not be the case. Customers may need to drive to a nearby town to pick up their prescriptions, which “could have some negative consequences on their adherence to their medication,” Lucas A. Berenbrok, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, explained to Nexstar.

“For those without reliable transportation, especially older adults or people with disabilities, traveling even a few extra miles can be a serious barrier,” Murphy said. That could lead to delayed access to prescriptions and missed dosages.

Closing pharmacies also reduces health access points for people. In addition to filling prescriptions, pharmacies are able to provide vaccines, chronic disease management, urgent consultations, over-the-counter treatments, and certain health tests.

“There’s a lot more going on at the pharmacy now than ever before,” Berenbrok explained, outlining how pharmacists helped to administer the COVID vaccine during the pandemic, for example, and the additional services they can provide in some states.

He went on to explain that while online pharmacies can help fill the void of shuttered drugstores, they’re largely unable to accommodate the additional services pharmacies provide.

“They also assume reliable internet access, digital literacy, and stable housing, which are barriers for many vulnerable patients,” Murphy said. “For communities losing local pharmacies, online options may fill part of the gap but cannot replace the full range of services a community pharmacist provides.”

Berenbrok agreed that mail-order pharmacies have “a time and place” because of their convenience, but they require planning ahead, which may not be useful for certain medications like antibiotics.

If your pharmacy is closing soon, Murphy recommended being proactive and asking your pharmacist where your prescriptions are being sent and whether that pharmacy has your insurance and medication history. He also encouraged asking for a 90-day supply or mail-order option for prescriptions if transportation is a concern.

Chains poised to take on former Rite Aid clients, like CVS and Walgreens, say they’re prepared to welcome new customers.

Even if your prescriptions are not moving to a new pharmacy, you may want to make sure your prescription is being filled a day or two before you need it rather than the same day that your current supply runs out, Berenbrok said. Then, if you’re short on time and facing a long line, you won’t miss a dose.

Murphy also suggested contacting elected officials and urging them to take action.

“While pharmacists are committed to stepping up to meet the need, without adequate state and federal policy changes to address the broken business model that caused the pharmacy to close in the first place, we will continue to see pharmacies close and patients having to navigate the loss of their trusted health care professional.”",https://www.nwahomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2025/06/AP24041553143926-e1748900946588.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-07 16:03:28.354419

Speaking at the just concluded 2025 Annual Meetings of the African Development Bank (AfDB) in Abidjan, Popoola emphasized that financial sovereignty and economic resilience should be built on deliberate domestic capital mobilization and scalable, tech-driven solutions.

According to the statement from the NGX, Popoola recalled the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and he noted that, “When foreign capital dried up and domestic capital stepped in to fill the void, it revealed something powerful: the capital we often seek abroad already exists within our borders.

“What is needed now is intentionality and a clear plan to mobilise and deploy it effectively.”

Drawing on his leadership of the NGX, which is one of Africa’s premier financial market infrastructure institutions, Popoola outlined three foundational pillars for Africa’s financial future: intentionality, financial literacy and technology-driven inclusion.

He urged public and private institutions alike to “speak the language of capital” by designing frameworks that align with the realities and expectations of local investors.

“Foreign capital follows local commitment,” he said. “When African institutions lead with clarity and confidence, others follow. But we must first trust and invest in ourselves.”

According to the report by Vanguard newspaper, Popoola also called for greater cross-border collaboration to accelerate the integration of African capital markets. Referencing the African Exchanges Linkage Project (AELP), an AfDB-backed initiative, he described it as a model for regional capital connectivity, while cautioning that regulatory silos and uneven infrastructure remain barriers.

It added that Popoola pointed to Nigeria’s InfraCredit as a successful model for unlocking institutional capital for infrastructure.

Then, it was officially known as the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson’s Bay.
The operation was extensive, all but giving Hudson’s Bay control over large swaths of the continent from modern-day Canada down into the Pacific Northwest.
Hudson’s Bay evolved after that, opening a chain of department stores in Canada starting in 1881.","The oldest company in North America — and one whose fingerprints linger in Vancouver — closed its doors earlier this week after more than three centuries in business.

The Hudson’s Bay Company, an iconic Canadian retailer, officially closed June 1 after declaring bankruptcy. It sold its name and all intellectual properties to another prominent retailer, Canadian Tire, which has no plans to resurrect Hudson’s Bay, according to media reports.

Tracy Fortmann was a brand new superintendent at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site when she made the trek to another former Hudson’s Bay fur trading post at Fort Langley National Historic Site in British Columbia in the early 2000s.

“We actually went to The Bay,” Fortmann said, referring to the retailer’s shortened name. “It was an enormous department store.

“My image of the Hudson’s Bay Company was anything but that,” she said, laughing.

Fortmann and her team at Vancouver’s historic site work daily among relics left by the Hudson’s Bay Company from a time when fur trappers and explorers roamed the grounds preparing for strenuous journeys into the wilds of the Pacific Northwest.

Fortmann said the company’s early days read like an adventure novel “of almost mythical proportion.”

England’s King Charles II granted a Royal Charter to the company in 1670. Then, it was officially known as the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson’s Bay.

The company spent its early days trading European goods and technology to Native Americans for animal furs before reselling them in Europe and Asia.

The operation was extensive, all but giving Hudson’s Bay control over large swaths of the continent from modern-day Canada down into the Pacific Northwest.

“These investors were granted exclusive trading rights over territory covering nearly half the continent,” Fortmann said. “Approximately 4 million square kilometers. The vastness of that, I just think is amazing.”

The company began as more than just a business, Fortmann said. It was more akin to the creation of a kingdom in all but name.

Hudson’s Bay’s legacy, still, is complex.

Native trackers were never given fair compensation for their work, Fortmann said.

“And there’s no question the fur trade was about exploitation of the land and of the resource,” she said.

It’s likely Natives have mixed feelings about the company, Fortmann said. Many married fur trappers and traders or were strongly tied to the company’s early days.

The Hudson’s Bay Company established Fort Vancouver as its Western headquarters in 1825, where it operated its fur business stretching from present-day Alaska to Northern California and from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.

Fortmann said the Pacific Northwest was a no-man’s-land when Hudson’s Bay set up shop here in the 19th century. (Natives likely traveled through the prairie where Fort Vancouver was established, but their villages were elsewhere, she said.)

Trade at the village near Fort Vancouver brought Natives from as far east as the Iroquois tribes, Fortmann said. An “incredible cosmopolitanlike community” developed here, she added.

Oregon and Washington weren’t officially part of the United States until 1846, when the company started winding down its Vancouver operation and Oregon Trail pioneers started arriving. The U.S. Army finally took control of the fort in 1866, cementing a community presence here.

Hudson’s Bay evolved after that, opening a chain of department stores in Canada starting in 1881. The stores, which sold high-end clothes and household goods, became the business’s focus.

The company continued fur trading until 1991, when executives told Canadian news outlet CBC the business wasn’t what it used to be.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1018971040-Hudsons-Bay_101-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 11:01:23.359860

Argos, a prominent British retail company known for its catalog-based shopping, has recently expanded its influence beyond the UK into the Canadian market. This development is significant not only for the retail landscape but also for consumers who are increasingly seeking versatile shopping experiences. With the retail industry evolving rapidly, Argos’s unique model of combining online and offline shopping could reshape consumer habits and expectations in Canada.

Expansion into Canada

In 2023, Argos announced plans to launch its services in Canada, capitalizing on the growing trend of omnichannel retailing. This strategy allows customers to browse products online and reserve them for in-store pickup or delivery, blending convenience with immediacy. The brand is set to establish a presence in major Canadian cities, creating a competitive landscape for existing retailers.

Consumer Experience

The success of Argos hinges on its user-friendly interface and diverse selection of products ranging from electronics to home goods. Canadian shoppers are increasingly accustomed to convenience and speed in their shopping experiences, factors that Argos aims to fulfill with innovations such as click-and-collect services. Market analysis suggests that this model can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, vital in today’s competitive retail environment.

Competitive Landscape

As Argos joins the Canadian market, it faces stiff competition from established retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and local chains such as Canadian Tire. The existing giants have a secure foothold, but Argos’s model encourages a more personalized and flexible shopping experience that new consumers might find appealing. Observers believe that Argos can capture a substantial market share by catering to the shifting needs of consumers who desire more choices in their shopping journeys.

Conclusion

As Argos launches in Canada, its impact on the retail industry will be closely monitored. The combination of a strong online presence with the convenience of physical stores positions Argos as a formidable player in a rapidly evolving market. If successful, it may inspire other retailers to adapt similar strategies to address changing consumer preferences. This evolution highlights the ongoing trend in retail towards personalized service and omnichannel shopping, ultimately enhancing the overall consumer experience.",https://infopetitenation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-military-vehicle-convoy-alberta-g7-22-32x32.jpeg,N,,2025-06-07 15:04:58.394243

These developments represent a significant escalation in labour tensions, as contract disputes, concerns over automation, and alleged unfair labour practices have pushed workers closer to walkouts that could disrupt grocery supply chains nationwide.

Workers at Kroger and Albertsons Unite Across States

In Colorado, the situation has reached a boiling point. Thousands of employees at Safeway and Albertsons stores, both owned by Albertsons Companies, have overwhelmingly voted to authorise a strike. Represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 7, these frontline workers are protesting what they describe as “unfair labour practices” by their employers, including cuts to health care, pension threats, and understaffing.

UFCW Local 7 President Kim Cordova issued a strong statement, alleging that Kroger’s King Soopers and City Market banners have colluded with Albertsons to propose drastic reductions in employee benefits and failed to properly staff stores. “At the bargaining table, this employer is holding hands with Kroger to propose major cuts to workers’ health care benefits, while rejecting meaningful efforts to address chronic understaffing,” she said.

Georgia: Strike Vote at Kroger Fulfilment Centre

Further south in Georgia, a separate group of Kroger employees is also making headlines. Drivers at a Kroger fulfilment centre in Forest Park, represented by Teamsters Local 528, have voted to authorise strike action amid stalled contract negotiations. The drivers are demanding fairer wages, comprehensive benefits, and enforceable protections in the workplace.

“Kroger needs to stop dragging its feet and deliver a real offer that respects the work we do,” said Marion Jackson, a shop steward for Local 528 and Kroger driver. “We’re not asking for the moon—just a contract that treats us like the essential workers we’ve proven to be.”

Albertsons Workers Oppose Driverless Trucks

At the national level, concerns about automation are adding further fuel to the fire. Teamsters Local 745, which represents hundreds of warehouse workers at Albertsons, has voted to authorise a strike in response to proposals that would allow the use of driverless trucks. The union warns that such a move would endanger jobs and public safety.

Tom Erickson, Director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, commented, “If Albertsons thinks it can threaten one group of Teamsters without a significant response, they’re in for a rude awakening. We will not allow automation to become an excuse for eliminating good jobs.”

Southern California Braces for Strike Vote

In Southern California, over 30,000 grocery workers from Ralphs, Vons, Pavilions, and Albertsons stores—covering much of the Kroger and Albertsons networks in the region—are preparing to vote on strike authorisation between June 8 and 11. These workers, also represented by UFCW, cite ongoing contract disputes and complaints of unfair treatment on the shop floor.

Given the sheer scale of this potential action, a strike could seriously impact grocery operations across the state of California. If approved, this would mark one of the largest strikes in the American grocery sector in recent years.

Companies Respond – But Concerns Remain

Albertsons has acknowledged the negotiations, stating it remains committed to productive dialogue with the unions involved. The company notes that contract extensions are in place and that stores continue to operate normally during talks. “We are hopeful to reach an agreement that benefits all parties,” said a spokesperson.

Kroger has so far been more muted in its response, with no official comment on the strike votes in Georgia or the broader dissatisfaction growing across its stores.

A Larger Labour Reckoning?

These strike votes underscore a broader shift taking place in the U.S. retail sector. After years of pandemic-driven hardship, inflation, and rising cost of living, supermarket employees are increasingly asserting their rights, demanding not just better pay but also dignity and security in the workplace.

For Kroger and Albertsons, this surge in collective action could not come at a more sensitive time. The two grocery giants are currently seeking regulatory approval for a $24.6 billion merger—a deal already under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) due to antitrust concerns.

As the merger remains in limbo, labour unrest threatens to complicate matters further, especially if widespread strikes disrupt service and weaken public perception of the companies’ ability to manage their workforce ethically.

Conclusion

With strikes now looming in multiple regions and workers from coast to coast speaking out, Kroger and Albertsons face a critical test of leadership. Whether they will respond with genuine engagement or continued resistance may determine not only the outcome of their merger but also the long-term loyalty of the people who keep their stores running.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-download-4-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 09:59:45.175674

The health risks associated with ingesting mineral water with pseudomonas aeruginosa are considered very low in healthy individuals, according to the letter. Individuals with weakened immune systems face the biggest health consequences.

The batch of water affected by the recall was sold as an 18-pack of 16.9 oz. (500 ml) glass bottles with the lot code #13A2541. Lot codes can be found on both the case and on the neck of the bottle.

According to the retailer, the products were sold between May 20 and 29, 2025, at select Costco warehouses in Texas and Louisiana. Shoppers who purchased one are encouraged to return it to their local store for a full refund.

Costco issued another major recall in January this year, putting out a warning about its Kirkland brand of cold and flu medicine. The retailer said the medicine was potentially contaminated by a “foreign material.”

Despite the recent product recalls, Costco is back in the good books with customers. The wholesale retailer has made several changes lately to help improve customer experience and satisfaction.

Costco extended the hours of operation at its gas stations, allowing members to avail of the lower gas prices and avoid long lines at peak times.

Costco also announced that it is working on its new Scan and Go feature in order to speed up the checkout process. The feature is already a staple of rival wholesaler Sam’s Club, with whom Costco is in constant competition.

""We have been working hard to address the $500 million deficit the State Health Plan is facing since my first day in office,"" Briner said.
State employees and retirees cannot afford to pay more,"" said Ardis Watkins, executive director of State Employees Association of N.C. ""We stand behind their efforts to hold CVS Caremark to their word.""
CVS Caremark said that ""we do not dispute their right to change their formulary.""","The State Health Plan has halted contract negotiations with CVS Caremark over what the agency is calling a refusal to honor current obligations for its pharmacy benefit manager services.

The SHP is North Carolina's largest purchaser of medical and pharmaceutical services, covering nearly 750,000 teachers, state employees, legislators, retirees and their dependents.

CVS Caremark has been the SHP's pharmacy benefit manager since 2017.

Pharmacy benefit managers are typically third-party administrators of prescription drug coverage, hired by employers, health plans and other payers to handle prescription drug claims processing, formularies development and rebate negotiations.

The Treasurer's Office said in a news release Thursday that 18 months of contract negotiations have resulted in ""an untenable impasse"" with CVS Caremark, ""which potentially endangers the financial well-being of the SHP.""

The SHP is evaluating its options to recover money it says CVS Caremark owes, as well as its future relationship with the insurer.

State Treasurer Brad Briner made the SHP's precarious financial status a major focus of his first term.

""We have been working hard to address the $500 million deficit the State Health Plan is facing since my first day in office,"" Briner said.

""Part of that work includes partnering with organizations who are committed to working alongside us.

""We cannot proceed with vendors who will force the Plan to raise premiums on our state employees by not honoring their contractual obligations.""

However. CVS Caremark said it is ""delivering on its contractual promises"" and that the SHP agreed in May to extend their contract through 2027.""

""CVS Caremark's record is clear: we lower the cost of prescription drugs for North Carolina's teachers and public employees,"" the health insurer said.

""According to the SHP, their pharmacy spend thus far in 2025 is $158 million less than initially budgeted. It has chosen to use those savings to help keep member premiums low.""

The SHP claims CVS Caremark has not been providing since 2023 agreed-upon rebates worth in the tens of millions of dollars.

""Caremark's repeated demands would rewrite the agreed upon contract with the SHP to increase its profits at the direct expense of teachers, state employees, retirees and taxpayers,"" according to the Treasurer's Office.

""Without these corrections, the Plan would face concerns of insolvency or extreme premium increases for Plan members.""

""Prescription drug costs are already sky high. State employees and retirees cannot afford to pay more,"" said Ardis Watkins, executive director of State Employees Association of N.C.

""We stand behind their efforts to hold CVS Caremark to their word.""

CVS Caremark said that it ""recognizes the State Plan is facing a significant budget shortfall and welcomes the opportunity to work together to create additional savings in their pharmacy spend.""

""To be clear, Caremark has always, and continues to, pass through to the State Health Plan 100% of rebates it receives on drugs used by its members.

""Rebates are a commonly used tool from manufacturers across industries that are essentially a post-sale discount. They are only earned on drugs that are actually purchased and dispensed.""

A key element of dispute is the SHP's decision in January 2024 to change its pharmacy plan to exclude coverage for Humira and anti-obesity coverage for GLP-1 drugs for its beneficiaries.

Former two-term Treasurer Dale Folwell recommended ending the coverage on April 1, 2024, for 24,749 SHP members prescribed a GLP-1 drug for weight loss.

Folwell claimed that continuing SHP coverage of weight-loss drugs purely for that purpose eventually would bankrupt the SHP. Folwell has projected the SHP facing a $4.2 billion budget gap over the next five years, what he calls ""an existential threat.""

CVS Caremark said that ""we do not dispute their right to change their formulary.""

""But, the State Health Plan is demanding that it continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates tied to drugs they chose to exclude when they changed their plan design.""

""In a show of good faith and partnership throughout this dispute, we have continued to pay the SHP.

""Continuing to pay this windfall is unsustainable.""",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 13:08:10.796458

The affected breathing circuits are used in hospitals and other clinical settings to deliver an oxygen mixture to patients under anesthesia or during mechanical ventilation. Any reduction in flow can result in low oxygen levels and potentially kill a patient.

While no serious injuries or deaths have been reported, due to the high risk of harm, the devices may need to be removed from care settings. However, the FDA and manufacturer Draeger are making clinicians aware of an updated set of use instructions to improve safety and reduce the risk of cracking in hose lines.

What is being recalled?

Multiple product lines from Draeger are subject to the recall, specifically parts in the anesthesia breathing kits. Below is a full breakdown.

Next Steps

The first thing the FDA is asking of users is to follow updated use instructions, including performing a leak test—an inspection for any cracks or wear—before every use of these breathing circuits. The check should be repeated after stretching the hose to the required length.

Draeger and the FDA remind clinicians to use hose holders to avoid creating cracks in the hose. If there’s any sign of damage, the devices must not be used.

More details were sent to known customers in a March Urgent Medical Device Notification. Any malfunction, further damage, or issue should be reported to FDA MedWatch and Draeger customer service at (267) 664-1131.

Rather, franchisee Dave McQueen said he was unable to sell his UPS stores and would be shuttering them in the next several weeks.","It may not exactly seem like your routine errands are the backbone of modern civilization.

And for the most part, that is a bit of an exaggeration.

It's not like your weekly trip to Publix or Walgreens is holding up society like some kind of house of cards, and if you miss a week, it will all come crumbling down.

But every one of us does our part.

And that means our weekly runs to the grocery store, drugstore, dry cleaners, restaurant, or gas station do have an impact on both the local and broader economy.

Which is part of the reason consumer spending matters.

It's also why many economists bellyache over prices; a small percentage point up or down can have outsized impact on how the average consumer approaches shopping.

Take eggs, for instance.

As prices steadily climbed and supply dwindled over the past several months, some customers hoarded eggs for fear of a shortage.

In turn, many supermarkets sold out of eggs entirely or put a limit on how many cases per customer were permitted for purchase. And prices continued to climb.

It's a small way to represent just how much consumer spending matters — even if a lot of those changes take place in the margins.

Consumer spending habits have changed

Of course, changes in customer behavior goes both ways.

In some cases, increased popularity and spending spike prices, squeezing supply.

But in many cases, especially recently, a decrease in interest or shifts in routine have turned prices (and profits) ever-downward.

More closings:

Popular local Dairy Queen rival suddenly closing, no bankruptcy

Another big Mexican chain closing down restaurant, no bankruptcy

Popular fast-food burger chain closes all restaurants in key area

This is what has happened on many Main Streets across the U.S.

As more of us shop online for our everyday needs, small mom-and-pop shops that cater to niche specialties — like carpets, auto parts, upholstery, crafts, or party supplies — suffer.

Profits get smaller, and many stores have had to make the difficult decision to either scale down operations significantly to make ends meet — or shut down entirely.

UPS makes a hard decision

And sometimes, it's not just mom-and-pop shops that suffer.

UPS (UPS) , a juggernaut in the U.S. shipping and fulfillment space, has weathered many changes over the past several years.

The company used to work hand-in-glove with Amazon to get packages to their final destinations, but it has agreed to reduce its partnership and cut shipments by about 50% by mid-2026.

It's also in the midst of modernizing its operations; it plans to close about 200 facilities around the U.S. by 2028, and intends to cut up to 20,000 jobs by the end of 2025.

And now, UPS is closing three stores owned by one franchise in Pennsylvania.

The UPS stores are located in:

62 Dallas Shopping Center, Dallas, Penn.

1330 Main St., Dickson City, Penn.

1114 Texas Palmyra Highway, Honesdale, Penn.

A spokesperson said the closures are not related to the broader restructuring efforts.

Rather, franchisee Dave McQueen said he was unable to sell his UPS stores and would be shuttering them in the next several weeks.

A UPS store spokesperson added that the closures are ""due to the expiration of the franchise agreements, and the franchisee has elected not to renew.""",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjgyMzIxMzU2MTcwNTEx/-a-united-parcel-service-truck-searches-for-a-house-while-driving-along-the-coast-of-cape-cod.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 10:00:05.316694

While the average intensity of oil sands producers is higher than the average for the global oil industry overall, drillers ‘emissions profiles vary widely around the world, said Kevin Birn, chief analyst for Canadian oil markets for S&P Global.
The oil sands “fits well within the range of carbon intensity of oil and gas we see in the world,” Birn said in an interview.
All of the oil sands mines reduced their emissions intensity with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.’s Horizon making the biggest gain for the year.","Canada’s oil sands industry reduced its emissions per barrel for the sixth straight year in 2023, even as one growing portion of the sector moved in the opposite direction, according to new Alberta government data released Thursday.

The emissions intensity of all oil sands sites fell to the equivalent of 0.399 metric tons of carbon dioxide per cubic meter of bitumen produced, down from 0.404 in 2022, the data show. The gain reflects improvements at oil sands mines, where bitumen is dug from the ground. However, in situ oil sands, which use wells similar to traditional oil producers, saw emissions per barrel rise.

Even with the efficiency improvement, total emissions rose to the equivalent 80.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, up from 78.8 million in 2022, the data show. That’s the highest in data back to 2011.

The oil sands’ declining energy intensity — to the lowest in data stretching back to 2011 — is welcome news for an industry that has struggled with a reputation for being climate unfriendly, prompting some investors to shun it altogether. However, the rising emissions intensity at well sites presents a challenge for the sector, as the method’s lower costs make it increasingly popular among producers.

While the average intensity of oil sands producers is higher than the average for the global oil industry overall, drillers ‘emissions profiles vary widely around the world, said Kevin Birn, chief analyst for Canadian oil markets for S&P Global.

The oil sands “fits well within the range of carbon intensity of oil and gas we see in the world,” Birn said in an interview.

All of the oil sands mines reduced their emissions intensity with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.’s Horizon making the biggest gain for the year.

In situ production facilities, which include the more than 250,000 barrel-a-day Suncor Energy Inc. Firebag site and Cenovus Energy Inc.’s Christina Lake, inject steam into the ground to pump the viscous bitumen out of the earth. The emissions intensity of such facilities, the source of about 52% of the bitumen produced in the oil sands, rose to 0.426 in 2023 from 0.417 a year earlier.

In situ sites’ emissions intensity can increase for a range of reasons, including simply through the addition of new wells, because steam is injected into the ground long before bitumen is produced, Birn said.

The biggest emissions intensity increases for large producing sites came from Strathcona Resources Ltd.’s Tucker, where intensity has been rising each year since 2018, the data show. The biggest drop happened at Canadian Natural’s Wolf Lake and Primrose Plant.

Strathcona and Canadian Natural didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",https://images.rigzone.com/images/news/articles/Canadas-Oil-Sands-Emissions-Intensity-Falls-for-Sixth-Year-180782-1200x628.png,N,,2025-06-07 15:05:23.811112

For further details see planning application PA25/03274 on Cornwall Council's website.","McDonald's has applied to build a drive-thru restaurant at a 'target location' in Cornwall. Following a pre-application bid to open a 12th outlet in the Duchy on land at Binhamy Retail Park at Stratton, Bude, earlier this year, the fast food giant has now applied for a drive-thru in Helston.

If both proposals are approved, there will be 13 golden arches across Cornwall. The current restaurants / takeaways are in Saltash, Pool, Bodmin, Fraddon, Newquay, Cornwall Services at Roche, St Austell, Threemilestone in Truro, Falmouth, Hayle and Penzance. McDonald's now hopes to open a drive-thru restaurant with around 75 seats, landscaping, car parking and associated works on land at the entrance to Helston Business Park adjacent to Clodgey Lane in the town.

The land was marketed by commercial property agents Vickery Holman with a guide price of £1.25 million. Interested parties included drive-thru food, coffee, bakery and convenience store occupiers and other developers. Ultimately, due to strong interest from the drive-thru and coffee sectors, Vickery Holman was instructed to request informal best bids from those interested parties and a total of three offers were received, all of which were of a roadside/retail and drive-thru nature. After due consideration and negotiations, terms were agreed with McDonald's and solicitors instructed.

A sequential test report, as part of the planning application, states: ""McDonald’s have identified Helston as a target location due to a need established through the lack of similar facilities nearby. The proposal would serve the local catchment area and population of Helston and the Lizard peninsula, and would reduce the need to travel to existing stores at Hayle, Penzance and Falmouth.

""There are no alternative suitable sites for a drive-thru restaurant within Helston town centre. The only identified available site has been assessed as being unsuitable. The proposed site represents a very accessible location and thus, the proposal accords with the sequential test.

New Energy Department shake-ups in 2025 reveal billions wasted, fierce industry lobbying, and fresh risks for taxpayers and property owners.

Federal spending on energy projects has come under intense scrutiny in 2025 as headline after headline exposes a stunning pattern: billions allocated, questionable results, and enormous taxpayer bills. Despite early Trump administration moves to cut back on several of the most controversial grants and loans, problems from Biden-era approvals still ripple nationwide.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently axed 24 high-dollar grants, totaling more than $3 billion in savings, and slashed an extra $7 billion in loans earlier this year. But these cuts barely dent the wave of taxpayer dollars funneled into corporate welfare, green tech promises, and high-risk infrastructure — with little accountability or tangible benefit for everyday Americans.

Below, we break down the five most eyebrow-raising projects, their tangled histories, and what taxpayers need to watch as 2025 spending ramps up again.

Q: Which Energy Projects Are Draining Tax Dollars?

The Energy Department approved a gigantic $9.63 billion direct loan to BlueOval SK LLC, a Ford-SK On joint venture, for EV battery factories in Tennessee and Kentucky. While BlueOval City in Tennessee pushes ahead, the Kentucky sites are mired in controversy—worker safety violations, toxic exposures, and costly construction delays. Property owners allege they were underpaid for their land as the state leveraged eminent domain.

The grant bonanza didn’t end at cars—giants like Exxon Mobil and Kraft Heinz raked in hundreds of millions in 2024 awards. Even as Exxon posted $33.7 billion in profits, the government authorized a $332 million hydrogen grant (since canceled), while Kraft Heinz secured up to $170.9 million for energy upgrades it pledged to fund itself anyway.

Lithium Americas nabbed a $2.26 billion loan to build new lithium facilities beside Nevada’s Thacker Pass, despite strong market demand and an expected $2.2 billion annual payoff—raising eyebrows about why taxpayer backing was needed at all. And steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs scored up to $575 million in green grants, another example of well-heeled companies cashing in on public funds.

How Did Property Owners Lose Out?

Tennessee’s state legislature not only awarded millions in tax credits to attract BlueOval but created an agency with sweeping powers—most controversially, the authority to seize private property for the project. Many locals were offered far less than market value for their land, fueling uproar and legal challenges.

Did Any Projects Improve Safety or the Environment?

Despite initial ambitions, the record is mixed. BlueOval’s Kentucky 1 plant faces state investigations over dozens of workplace injuries, mold outbreaks, chemical exposure risks, and blocked exits. Cleveland-Cliffs’ projects aim to cut emissions but haven’t yet proven measurable results. Meanwhile, canceled projects like Exxon’s hydrogen conversion could have advanced clean tech but struggled to justify taxpayer involvement given billion-dollar corporate profits.

What’s Next? Is the Spending Spree Over?

Not even close. Recent reporting hints that the Energy Department may back a $44 billion Alaska pipeline—a move that could ignite new debates on federal priorities and risk.

Taxpayers, watchdogs, and lawmakers are left asking: Who really benefits when mega-corporations get public cash, and when will oversight catch up?

How Can Taxpayers Stay Informed — and Protected?

Track new federal grant announcements via official sources like energy.gov and whitehouse.gov.

Follow nonpartisan watchdogs such as GAO for audit results and investigations.

Voice concerns to local representatives, especially when property rights or local impacts are involved.

Scrutinize corporate press releases for real, verifiable updates on project outcomes.

Barclays analysts following the closing arguments came away with mixed views.

“We listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better, in terms of GOOGL stock price impact,” analyst at Barclays said.

A decision is expected in late July or early August, and any measures could begin 60 days later.

Barclays flagged the potential cancellation of Google’s traffic acquisition costs and ad syndication deals as the biggest financial risks, estimating they could account for up to 20% of gross profit globally, or 10% if applied only to the U.S. market.

While a forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser still appears unlikely, Barclays said the odds have “increased” and called such a move a major blow to GOOGL but a significant win for any acquirer, citing names like OpenAI.

Barclays also pointed to uncertainty around how AI might change the search market, with the court appearing to consider “forward-looking” remedies rather than just targeting traditional search links.

It added that the judge’s tone suggested some of the DOJ’s proposed actions could be adopted, potentially ruling out softer options like non-exclusive revenue sharing via choice screens.

Google’s stock has so far shrugged off the case, but Barclays noted that remedy duration could last around five years, and some of the changes, such as contract cancellations, might be delayed to allow partners like Mozilla to adjust.

The firm maintained its coverage and directed investors to earlier notes for detailed modeling of potential impacts.

Press Release, Saint-Cloud and Mumbai, 05 June 2025: Dassault Aviation and Tata Advanced Systems Limited have signed four Production Transfer Agreements to manufacture the Rafale fighter aircraft fuselage in India, marking a significant step forward in strengthening the country’s aerospace manufacturing capabilities and supporting global supply chains. This facility represents a significant investment in India’s aerospace infrastructure and will serve as a critical hub for high-precision manufacturing.

Under the scope of the partnership, Tata Advanced Systems will set up a cutting-edge production facility in Hyderabad for the manufacture of key structural sections of the Rafale, including the lateral shells of the rear fuselage, the complete rear section, the central fuselage, and the front section. The first fuselage sections are expected to roll off the assembly line in FY2028, with the facility expected to deliver up to two complete fuselages per month.

“For the first time, Rafale fuselages will be produced outside France. This is a decisive step in strengthening our supply chain in India. Thanks to the expansion of our local partners, including TASL, one of the major players in the Indian aerospace industry, this supply chain will contribute to the successful ramp-up of the Rafale, and, with our support, will meet our quality and competitiveness requirements”, said Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation.

Sukaran Singh, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Tata Advanced Systems Limited, said, “This partnership marks a significant step in India’s aerospace journey. The production of the complete Rafale fuselage in India underscores the deepening trust in Tata Advanced Systems’ capabilities and the strength of our collaboration with Dassault Aviation. It also reflects the remarkable progress India has made in establishing a modern, robust aerospace manufacturing ecosystem that can support global platforms.”

The signing of these contracts reflects Dassault Aviation’s strong commitment to India’s ‘Make in India’ and AtmaNirbhar initiatives. This partnership aims to strengthen India’s position as a key player in the global aerospace supply chain while supporting its goal of greater economic self-reliance.

The Wells Fargo drive, which is also supported by a coalition called the Committee for Better Banks, has stretched on for two years with little success.

The meeting resulted in the following advice, according to a post on the JPMC Workers Alliance's official website:

""Build trust before going public.""

""Use natural workplace conversations (e.g. breaks, lunch, text conversations) to test the waters and build confidence.""

""Talk outside of work with colleagues to gauge their sentiment.""

""Keep management in the dark about the process.""

""Push back against illegal management activity. Managers may not *SPIT: Surveil, Promise, Interfere, or Threaten with respect to unionizing activity or outcomes — but they may not know this.""

""Reframe the risks to increase confidence: The status quo is the real hazard. Would they fire the whole department?""

JPMorgan's unionization effort was spawned in large part by the bank's return-to-office policies. Earlier this year, JPMorgan summoned the roughly 40% of its workers who were still on a COVID-era hybrid work schedule back to their desks five days a week, kicking off complaints from employees of the Polaris campus, a major technology hub for the firm. Unlike JPMorgan's investment bankers, tech workers had been working from home a couple of days a week.

It's unclear how many JPMorgan workers have agreed to unionize as a result, but the JPMC Workers Alliance website boasts members from a number of US states, including New York, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Texas, as well as multiple cities in the United Kingdom.

To build support, JPMorgan's organizers have been handing out flyers and hosting events, including a recent pizza party at JPMorgan's massive Polaris campus in Columbus, Ohio, which attracted hundreds of employees. New members are vetted by a group of organizers responsible for confirming their identities and welcoming them to the alliance's group chat on Discord, a messaging app popular with video gamers.

The event drew an estimated 250 to 300 workers, said a JPMorgan employee affiliated with the union who requested anonymity to protect his job. As employees lined up to grab a slice, organizers approached them to discuss the labor movement and its goals, this person said.

""Happy International Workers Day,"" read the flyers, which were viewed by Business Insider. ""Did your leadership thank you today? You deserve better.""

The handouts asked questions like:

""Have you had to stand in the rain waiting for the shuttle?""

""Was 30 days enough notice for you to find child care before RFTO?"" The acronym refers to the full-time return to work.

""Have you struggled to find an open desk?""

The Michaels Companies announced on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of Joann's intellectual property and private label brands — in an acquisition that arrives as the Texas-based arts and crafting chain works to expand its own fabric, sewing and yarn offerings.

“We’re honored to have the opportunity to welcome JOANN customers into our creative community and are committed to delivering the selection, value, and inspiration they are looking for at Michaels,” Michaels CEO David Boone said in a statement. The deal, he added, allows the company to better “respond to rising demand” among both new and existing customers.

Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The Associated Press reached out to Michaels for further information on Friday.

With roots dating back to a single Ohio storefront in 1943, Joann had grown into a destination for generations of sewers, quilters, knitters and lovers of other crafts for more than 80 years. But more recently, operational challenges continued to pile up — with the retailer pointing to sluggish consumer demand, inventory shortages and rising competition.

Joann announced it would be going out of business back in February, just one month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year. At the time, the company said financial services company GA Group, together with Joann’s term lenders, had been selected as the winning bidder to “acquire substantially all of Joann’s assets” and conduct going-out-of-business sales at all store locations.

Michaels on Thursday said that its purchase of Joann's IP and private brands included the acquisition of “Big Twist” yarns, which had become a staple in Joann stores over the years.

Those “Big Twist” labels are now being developed as part of Michaels' portfolio — and will be available in-stores and online later this year, the company said. In the meantime, Michaels has also dedicated a landing page to welcome former Joann customers online.

And as part of its overall expansion into fabrics, Michaels said on Thursday that its adding more than 600 new products from new and existing brands — including quilting supplies and fabrics, specialty threads, sewing machines and more.

Michaels, founded in 1973, currently operates 1,300 stores across 49 U.S. states and Canada. Its parent company also owns Artistree, a framing merchandise manufacturer.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/06/PDTN/84076888007-ap-25157581508633.jpg?crop=5291,2978,x0,y439&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-07 14:06:44.303897

The scheme was launched in in 2018 by AB InBev, aiming to focus on regenerative agriculture, circular packaging and energy efficiency, offering fledgeling businesses access to advanced pilot facilities to hone their respective ventures, which has included a number of enterprises operating with value chains linked to the confectionery and snacking sector.

Among its successes including smallholder support platforms targeting enhancing agriculture sustainability and farmer livelihoods, low emission logistics including EV retrofitting, biofuels and smart fleet analytics, and compostable bio-based packaging from bacterial cellulose.

Indeed, as Mondelez (which made a prominent appearance once more at last month’s Sweets & Snacks Expo – catch our exclusive video review of the event featuring Grace Howard, Sour Patch Innovation manager), confirmed, a total of 190 startups in 40 countries have been assisted, with a many of these going on to form integrated partnerships with the companies at the core of the programme. As the business asserts, this is forms a crucial part of its efforts to lead on collaboration across the industry in delivering sustainable innovations at scale.

Its contribution to the global scheme comes in addition to its own Co-Lab venture, which has in recent years offered direct support to a number of aspiring confectionery and snacks-based ventures that have gained its support in furthering their innovations.

Christine Montenegro McGrath, Chief Impact and Sustainability Officer, Mondelēz International expressed confidence that the initiative had already proved fruitful to a wide spectrum of businesses seeking to develop inventive and environmentally mindful solutions for the food and drink sector.

She said: “Joining the 100+ Accelerator is a natural extension of our Sustainability strategy—a strategy that is resilient and built with an aim for long-term, sustainable business growth. We strive to continue building a snacking company that helps drive positive impact at scale. We believe this collaboration would allow us to further help startup sustainability innovators move further, faster by harnessing collective industry expertise and delivering more meaningful solutions for people and the planet.”

“Having Mondelēz International join the 100+ Accelerator brings a fresh perspective to the program that strengthens our reach and impact,” said Ingrid De Ryck, Chief Sustainability Officer at AB InBev. “By working across industries, we’re unlocking bold solutions that can help transform global supply chains.”

“We’re really sorry about this and working to fix it as quickly as possible.

More than 3,000 outages were reported through services monitoring site Downdetector at about 10am on Friday.

Disgruntled customers took to social media site X to express their frustration over the outage, which has left them unable to send or receive money through the app.

Several users said they could not pay bills, send wages, or transfer funds between accounts on Friday morning.

NatWest reassured customers the issue stemmed from an update it made to the app on Thursday, after some customers raised concerns over recent major cyber hacks affecting Marks & Spencer and the Co-op.

High street banks have been in the firing line over a string of outages that have affected customers, particularly around the end of month when it is typically pay day for many households.

Data gathered by the Treasury Committee in March found there had been more than 33 days’ worth of unplanned tech and system outages in the last two years for nine of the UK’s biggest banks and building societies.

NatWest had 13 “material” incidents between 2023 and 2025, paying nearly £350,000 in compensation for customers who complained, it told the committee.

Barclays said it could pay up to £12.5 million in compensation for millions of customers affected over the period.

Jenny Ross, money editor for consumer champion Which?, said: “Banks are encouraging more and more of us to rely on apps to do our essential banking, so when these go down it can be devastating.

“In the worst cases there’s a risk that impacted NatWest customers may miss important bill payments, find themselves unable to pay for essential services or risk going overdrawn – issues which could come with knock-on effects like late payment or overdraft penalties, or affect their ability to get credit or borrow money.

Refiberd exemplifies how technological innovation can help bridge longstanding structural gaps in the fashion system,” Federica Marchionni, CEO of the GFA, said.
“Having our technology recognized by so many influential members of the fashion and textile industry is incredible validation for our team,” she said.
“Innovation cannot stop; people and the planet count on us.” Textile recycling startup Refiberd has won the Global Fashion Agenda’s second Trailblazer Programme award.
Presented by GFA and PDS Ventures at the Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen this week, Refi","Textile recycling startup Refiberd has won the Global Fashion Agenda’s second Trailblazer Programme award.

Presented by GFA and PDS Ventures at the Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen this week, Refiberd was shortlisted under the “closed-loop pathways” category and recognized for the potential systemic impact of its “pioneering technology.”

“At this year’s summit, we are challenging the industry to address its greatest obstacles and implement proven catalysts for change. Refiberd exemplifies how technological innovation can help bridge longstanding structural gaps in the fashion system,” Federica Marchionni, CEO of the GFA, said. “Their solution reflects the spirit of the Trailblazer Programme, and the theme of ‘Barriers and Bridges’ by turning challenge into opportunity.”

The Trailblazer Programme—a talent search supporting early-stage innovators accelerating industry-wide advancements— will award Refiberd the with up to $200,000 in cash, plus commercial and operational backing from Positive Materials, pending completion of financial and legal due diligence and committee approvals.

“Refiberd embodies the spirit of visionary entrepreneurship—developing breakthrough technology with the potential to transform the fashion industry,” said Pallak Seth, founder and executive vice chairman at PDS Limited. “The funding support provided through this award will be instrumental in scaling its innovations and driving forward circular textile recycling across the supply chain.”

The Portugal-based R&D hub operating under the aegis of PDS Group will work to help scale the winning solution. Which, for Refiberd, comes following the jury’s “recognition of the need for more accurate material data across the supply chain,” co-founder and CEO Sarika Bajaj said.

“Having our technology recognized by so many influential members of the fashion and textile industry is incredible validation for our team,” she said. “This opportunity comes at a critical growth point for Refiberd; we are thrilled to work toward scaling our technology with [this] support.”

The startup shines hyperspectral imaging on textiles to capture each material’s unique spectral “fingerprint,” and AI decodes these fingerprints to determine the exact fiber mix and any contaminants. This enables accurate sorting for recycling, authenticating resold garments—and verifying material data in digital product passports.

Since launching in 2020, Refiberd has amassed awards from the likes of SXSW Pitch, Fashion for Good and the H&M Foundation—not to mention raising $3.4 million in funding—all within three years.

In April, eBay named Refiberd as its Circular Fashion Innovator of the Year. The online marketplace’s venture capital arm awarded the Cupertino, Calif.-based startup with a $300,000 investment to support scaling.

Meanwhile, the award saw interest nearly double against the inaugural effort, having received over 200 applications from more than 40 countries across six continents. This “incredible momentum,” per PDS, is reflective of the partners’ commitment to “empower founders” to reimagine fashion’s future.

“Action is taken when we support entrepreneurs to convert their ideas into feasible business—and what better way to do it than through collective intelligence at the Trailblazer program,” said jury member Yuly Fuentes-Medel, program director for textiles, climate grand challenges, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Innovation cannot stop; people and the planet count on us.”

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui Ching-yu also said on Saturday that about 180 family offices had been set up or expanded their operations in Hong Kong this year, putting the city on track to surpass its year-end goal of 200.
“Since the enactment of the relevant company re-domiciliation regime legislation on May 23, we have had a very positive response from the market, with inquiries about how [businesses] can do that and the detailed procedures,” he said.

NBA wants to expand in India, and Budweiser is already a big brand here with plans to grow further.
Sharma: It’s a trend we’re watching closely, but in India, it’s still nascent.
Sharma: India has 1.4 billion people, but only around 100,000 outlets sell alcohol — that’s very limited access.","In the ever-evolving world of marketing, staying culturally relevant and emotionally resonant is key. For Budweiser, this means diving deep into the passions of young Indian consumers — from music and sports to influencer-driven storytelling. Leading this charge is Vineet Sharma, Vice President – Marketing at AB InBev India, the company that brews and distributes Budweiser, Corona, Hoegaarden and more in the country.

Storyboard18 sat down with Sharma to decode Budweiser's recent NBA collaboration, its culture-first strategy, and how the brand is leaning into digital and experiential marketing in a market where beer consumption remains modest by global standards, but where aspirations are rapidly rising.

Q. What inspired the BudX NBA House collaboration, and how does it align with Budweiser's long-term vision for India?

Sharma: Budweiser and the NBA share similar values — freedom, ambition, authenticity. As Gary Payton said at the event, it's about seizing the opportunity. Both brands are built around individuals on the rise, striving for greatness. And importantly, both put fans at the center.

That synergy formed the basis of our collaboration. This was the first-ever BudX NBA House globally — it doesn’t exist outside India. Typically, there are NBA Houses around the world, but here, we co-created an entirely new IP. BudX, which we've been building in India since 2017, has always championed music, lifestyle, and culture. NBA House aligns with those same values. Instead of running separate initiatives, we brought them together.

NBA wants to expand in India, and Budweiser is already a big brand here with plans to grow further. It was the perfect partnership to kick off this journey.

Q. What are Budweiser’s key marketing strategies this year? Any exciting campaigns in the pipeline?

Sharma: Music and sports have always been the foundation of Budweiser. In Q1, we launched a campaign called ‘Yours To Take,’ which celebrated fan energy at music festivals. Today, experiences are the new currency for young Indians. People are no longer flying abroad for events — they want world-class experiences right here. Concerts priced at ₹5,000 to ₹50,000 are selling out within minutes. That tells you a lot about this generation’s spending power.

The ‘Yours To Take’ campaign brought fan energy to life in one creative space — a collective celebration. We’re proud partners of global IPs like Lollapalooza, DGTL, Boiler Room, and Mixmag. In Q4, expect more such collaborations.

Right now, Q2 and Q3 are focused on sports. The BudX NBA House is just the beginning of how we plan to bring fan culture alive in sports. We’ve been FIFA partners since 1986, and we’ll continue through the 2026 World Cup in the US, Mexico, and Canada. So yes — it’s a packed calendar of music and sports. And in India, we're building these global IPs with local flavor.

Q. How is AB InBev balancing sustainability with mass production in India?

Sharma: While sustainability isn’t my direct portfolio, it’s integral to everything we do. From water usage and packaging to working with farming communities, sustainability is a core focus globally and in India. We’ve received recognition from media and industry bodies. One of our flagship initiatives is the “100+ Accelerator” which supports sustainability-led startups.

Q. What's your strategy for alcohol-free beers in an increasingly wellness-conscious market?

Sharma: It’s a trend we’re watching closely, but in India, it’s still nascent.

India’s per capita beer consumption is about 2 liters — far below the global average of 35–40 liters. So the bigger opportunity is bringing new legal-age consumers into the category. Many young Indians only begin exploring alcohol once they move to cities or start living independently. Introducing them to beer — a drink of moderation — is our top priority.

We do have non-alcoholic options like Budweiser 0.0 and Budweiser Green Apple 0.0, and they’ve been well received. While it's still a small segment, we're the market leader in it. Over time, we’ll expand offerings across other brands like Hoegaarden and Corona.

Q. Do regional preferences influence your portfolio strategy? Do you tailor products or campaigns by region?

Sharma: Absolutely. We segment our portfolio between core and international brands.

International brands like Budweiser, Corona, and Hoegaarden appeal to aspirational consumers across India — from metros like Mumbai and Delhi to tier-2 cities like Lucknow or Bhubaneswar. These consumers seek premium, lifestyle-driven products.

For core brands like Haywards and Royal Challenge, regional preferences are crucial — from flavor profiles to pricing. In the value segment, even a ₹5 difference can impact brand loyalty. But in premium, consumers are willing to pay more if the brand resonates with them.

Q. Tell us about ABI’s retail and ecommerce presence. How are you adapting to online alcohol delivery in India?

Sharma: India has 1.4 billion people, but only around 100,000 outlets sell alcohol — that’s very limited access. Of these, about 80,000 are retail outlets. So physical retail remains vital.

Ecommerce is currently only legal in West Bengal and Odisha. In these states, platforms like Swiggy deliver alcohol just like food. But elsewhere, online sales are not permitted due to state-specific regulations.

We don’t run our own D2C platforms — instead, we work with legal partners to increase brand visibility and offer promotions. In the states where ecommerce is allowed, we hold a 55% market share in online beer sales. But overall, it’s still a small slice of our business. Most sales still come from retail and on-trade (bars, restaurants).

Q. Do you plan to expand ecommerce efforts?

Sharma: That depends on the government. Since alcohol is a state subject in India, we can only advocate for change. We believe responsible ecommerce can improve access and enforce age gating more effectively than physical stores.

But the final decision rests with policymakers. For now, we continue to work within the legal framework in West Bengal and Odisha and hope for more progressive policies across states.

Q. How do influencer and content creator partnerships fit into your marketing playbook?

Sharma: Influencer partnerships are essential — especially for digital and experiential marketing. Today’s consumers are savvy. They know when a message is authentic versus when it’s paid promotion.

We’re very intentional about who we partner with. It’s not just about follower count — the tone, alignment with brand values, and community connection all matter. We’ve built a strong internal framework to evaluate partnerships. Globally, we’ve had iconic partnerships with FIFA, NBA, and even the Olympics. Locally, we collaborate with creators, food brands, and music communities who truly connect with our audience.",https://images.storyboard18.com/storyboard18/2025/06/Resize-2-43-2025-06-26ef10257f19eacac7a34d1fbc5f4060-768x432.png,N,,2025-06-07 05:01:10.817967

The Michaels Companies announced on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of Joann’s intellectual property and private label brands — in an acquisition that arrives as the Texas-based arts and crafting chain works to expand its own fabric, sewing and yarn offerings.

“We’re honored to have the opportunity to welcome JOANN customers into our creative community and are committed to delivering the selection, value, and inspiration they are looking for at Michaels,” Michaels CEO David Boone said in a statement. The deal, he added, allows the company to better “respond to rising demand” among both new and existing customers.

Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The Associated Press reached out to Michaels for further information on Friday.

With roots dating back to a single Ohio storefront in 1943, Joann had grown into a destination for generations of sewers, quilters, knitters and lovers of other crafts for more than 80 years. But more recently, operational challenges continued to pile up — with the retailer pointing to sluggish consumer demand, inventory shortages and rising competition.

Joann announced it would be going out of business back in February, just one month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year. At the time, the company said financial services company GA Group, together with Joann’s term lenders, had been selected as the winning bidder to “acquire substantially all of Joann’s assets” and conduct going-out-of-business sales at all store locations.

Michaels on Thursday said that its purchase of Joann’s IP and private brands included the acquisition of “Big Twist” yarns, which had become a staple in Joann stores over the years.

Nintendo's Switch 2 hit the shelves on Thursday - with fans so excited for the release that retailers have had to accommodate shoppers.

George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst at Omdia, told CNBC: ""Today is the biggest console launch of all time, so as expected, there is a frenzy of Nintendo fans checking stock availabilities at their local stores or eagerly awaiting deliveries.""

They're intended to serve up a hot meal quickly and allow customers to get on their way as fast as possible.

And many newer conveniences and advancements have only made rapid dining even quicker.

Drive-thrus, mobile ordering, and delivery options allow customers to get their meals with just a click of a button -- or sometimes without even leaving their homes or cars.

So it's probably not often that you consider the underlying business and logistics that make your favorite fast food meal possible.

For instance, not many people think about the Starbucks business model.

We just know that there's one on every corner, and that seems to work pretty well.

But Starbucks has spent years researching and discovering that a cafe on every corner doesn't just capture the maximum number of patrons -- it also crowds out competition.

Starbucks isn't alone.

Fast food companies across the U.S. have deliberated for years on business best practices -- and rapidly change based on what they learn.

Fast food chains constantly iterate

Fast food restaurants are constantly working to improve the customer experience so they can quickly serve as vast of a population as possible.

In the 2010s, for example, when having a wide array of choices was popular, menus expanded.

More Food & Dining:

Popular Mexican chain closing all restaurants, no bankruptcy

Iconic Warren Buffett candy store suddenly closing after 30 years

Walmart's Sam's Club makes a Costco-style food court change

Popular Trader Joe's wine brand has bad news, making harsh choice

Suddenly, chains from Chipotle to Starbucks to Subway to Wendy's grew their menus to offer more choices for a diverse customer base.

Nowadays, many customers are more health-conscious.

So chains like Steak and Shake and In-N-Out are doing away with less healthful ingredients and swapping them for things like beef tallow or less-processed products.

Subway owner buys a new chain

Of course, those at the top of the food chain are always in growth mode.

In addition to catering to an ever-changing customer taste, the biggest fast food chains are constantly expanding to either beat out competition -- or buy them outright.

And now, Roark Capital, a private equity firm, will buy Dave's Hot Chicken -- a popular fried chicken chain.

Dave's Hot Chicken serves things like chicken sliders with varying levels of heat, ranging from no spice to reaper level.

It has over 300 locations across the globe.

The deal, which is reportedly worth about $1 billion, will allow Dave's Hot Chicken to expand further. It currently has plans to grow up to 400 restaurants around the world by the end of 2025.

Roark Capital owns a fast food portfolio which includes Subway, which has been struggling lately. It closed over 600 restaurants in 2024.

It also has substantial investments across the fast food industry.

According to United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 7, 99% of Safeway employees across the Denver metro area voted to authorize a strike unless Albertsons, the grocer's parent company, responds to the union’s demands.

""They're not paying a liveable wage. They don't want to fully fund health care and pension while they're making profit on high grocery prices with less service,"" Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, said in a Facebook video released Friday.

Denver7 spoke with Cordova via phone on Friday. She said this is the first time Colorado Safeway workers have voted to strike over unfair labor practices in nearly 30 years.

If an agreement isn't reached by Sunday night, King Soopers workers could vote to authorize the second strike of the year. In February, employees went on strike for 12 days before the union and grocery chain agreed to resume negotiations.

While workers fight for better wages, shoppers like Alisha Ford plan to avoid the grocery giants altogether.

""We’ll actually even go to a different store just to avoid the people who are sitting right out the front door,"" said Ford.

In addition, the disruption stems from China’s decision in early April to tighten export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, which are essential for manufacturing hybrid vehicles, EV motors, catalytic converters, and other automotive components. While Beijing introduced the measures in response to new tariffs from President Trump, most of which have since been paused, the export restrictions remain in force globally.

China dominates over 90% of the global rare earth supply chain, making its licensing policies a critical bottleneck. According to the Asian newspaper Nikkei, only 25% of export license requests have been approved since the rules took effect. The New York Times reported that the delays are affecting even Chinese manufacturers, with some magnet producers pausing operations amid export gridlock.

Moreover, the escalating restorations have broader implications that extend beyond the automotive industry, affecting sectors such as robotics and defense.

And while recent tariff moves have calmed investors' worst fears for now — even carrying Amazon stock near a possible buy point this week, after it tumbled early this year — big questions remain, with the potential to upend business at Amazon and its competitors.

On last month's Amazon earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts the company's outlook reflected ""the general uncertainty that we're seeing."" And the comment wasn't unusual. In other calls with analysts, Walmart (WMT) CFO John David Rainey warned the industry faces ""a lot of uncertainty, a lot of volatility,"" while Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Barry pointed to uncertainty ""related to tariff levels, timing and countries involved.""

↑ X NOW PLAYING The U.S.-China Trade Reset: What Investors Need To Know

The warnings underlined how retail giants like Amazon and Walmart and the businesses that sell products through them are grappling with the tariff turmoil that pushed them behind the eight ball in a fast-changing economy. President Donald Trump's trade policies have disrupted supply chains, triggering fears of rising prices and slumping consumer demand.

A tariff truce with China has brought temporary relief, helping Amazon stock and other megacap tech stocks bounce back. But the roller coaster ride isn't over. Big retailers led by Amazon, Walmart and Target (TGT) are bracing for more sharp drops and turns in the coming summer shopping season, when the magnitude of the disruption is expected to become clearer.

Spotlight On Prime Day

The spotlight now is on one of the year's biggest shopping events, Prime Day.

The tariff turmoil rattled businesses gearing up for Amazon's much-awaited shopping event for Prime members in July. Goods with ties to China represent about 30% of the gross merchandise value sold on Amazon's platform, according to Raymond James. Amazon's third-party marketplace includes sellers based in China as well as U.S. companies that import goods from the country.

Until recently, brands that sell on Amazon were grappling with a 145% tariff on goods made in China as they figured out their plans for Prime Day.

""There were real discussions of 'Are we going to do Amazon Prime Day?'"" Samantha Coxe, chief executive of Flaus, a maker of electric flossers, told Investor's Business Daily. ""Are we going to sell out (existing inventory)? Are we going to have to increase prices?""

U.S.-China Tariff Deal Brings Relief

Pattern, which partners with brands to sell their products on Amazon and elsewhere, felt that it was at a ""precipice,"" Chief International Officer Brett Bardsley told IBD. Without ""tariff news,"" it risked quickly consuming the inventory it had, with uncertainty about when manufacturers could provide more goods.

Then came a major twist. The Trump administration announced a deal with China that would scale back the stunning 145% tariff on Chinese imports to a still painful, but perhaps manageable, 30%.

The reduction was enough for Coxe to declare ""full-steam ahead"" for Flaus' Prime Day plans. The company shipped all the devices that its manufacturer in China was holding and expects to have enough to stretch into late this year.

Pattern, too, got the news it was looking for with the tariff reduction. Manufacturers ramped back up quickly, and the company leaned on airfreight and expedited shipping to refill its domestic inventory, Bardsley said.

Shifting Tariff Policies

The two companies' stories underscore the uncertainty that all retailers have been working with since Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. While tariffs on most trading partners were reduced to a baseline 10% later that month, goods from China were facing a 145% Trump tariff by the time Amazon reported first-quarter results on May 1. By the time Walmart reported its Q1 on May 15, the China tariffs had been slashed to 30%.

The China truce is expected to boost the summer shopping season. But it is unlikely to fully clear up the uncertainty which many retailers have cited as a drag on business.

The turmoil became even more pronounced when a U.S. court put all of Trump's tariffs on hold two weeks later around the time Best Buy reported its results, only for an appeals court to pause that ruling. The legal fight us expected to land in the Supreme Court.

""There's just so much uncertainty,"" Alison Layfield, director of product development at global shipping provider ePost Global, told IBD. ""You may have goods in transit and then (a change) hits.""

Summer Sales Key For Amazon Stock

Shoppers have mostly held steady so far. U.S. e-commerce spending was pacing toward 8% year-over-year growth in May, according to JPMorgan. That's in-line with April's growth rate and down just slightly from 9% in March.

The annual Amazon Prime Day shopping event in July offers retail's next big test. The company has not announced the dates. But Amazon has said it expects deals to spill out over four days this year, doubling the length of last year's event.

With concerns about tariffs raising prices overall, shoppers appear anxious for deals. More than 80% of Amazon Prime members surveyed in early May said they expected to shop on Amazon during Prime Day, up from 68% in 2024, according to research firm Tinuiti.

Prime Day isn't just significant for Amazon and Amazon stock. The decade-old tradition has been so successful that rivals like Walmart and Target typically launch sales campaigns that same month.

Last year, U.S. shoppers spent an estimated $14.2 billion across e-commerce platforms during the two-day Prime Day event, according to Adobe Analytics.

'Head-Spinning' Reaction To Tariffs

But the impact of the tariff turmoil on one of the biggest shopping seasons of the year remains unclear. Even with the rollbacks on the highest rates, U.S. retailers still face a 30% tariff on Chinese imports and roughly 10% tariffs on goods from nearly anywhere else.

""The initial reaction was head-spinning for brands and retailers trying to figure out what to do with 145% tariffs – many had paused shipments from China after pulling orders ahead,"" EMarketer e-commerce analyst Sky Canaves told IBD. ""Now there is a sigh of relief. But there is still the uncertainty of a 90-day pause (for China tariffs) while we are smack in the middle of the pause on reciprocal tariffs.""

Meanwhile, consumer confidence ticked up after the U.S.-China trade agreement but remains sharply down from the start of the year.

While the tariffs are under fire in court, tensions between the U.S. and China have been heating back up, stressing what analysts see as a fragile trade war detente.

""We would stress that it's far from clear that the 90-day pause is an uncertainty-clearing event,"" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote to clients on May 18. ""Trade tensions are likely to remain elevated.""

Tariff Impact On Retail Supply Chains

The U.S. and China account for 51% of all cross-border retail e-commerce sales globally, according to Euromonitor. But the supply chain connecting the two economic superpowers has felt the effect of the tariff whirlwind.

Amazon and its marketplace sellers had beefed up their inventories before tariffs took effect to keep inventory up, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts on May 1. A surge of U.S. imports in the first quarter showed that other retailers followed suit.

But imports slowed significantly as the tariffs hit. They picked back up rapidly following the May 12 deal between the U.S. and China. Container-tracking software firm Vizion found that bookings from China to the U.S. jumped 157.6% for the week of May 12, compared to a week earlier.

Bracing For Prime Day

In fact, while some companies were reportedly planning to sit out Prime Day or at least go lighter on discounts, others are now quickly moving to get their products ready. Some companies are ""sitting quite heavy"" on inventory to protect against future trade changes, which puts them in a position to discount, Bardsley said.

Still, some categories like electronics or brands with large exposure to China are expected to move cautiously when it comes to discounts, he added.

Amazon is ""pleased by the strong response from selling partners to Prime Day 2025,"" a spokesperson said in an email.

""We're working with our broad, varied range of valued selling partners in our store to support them in adapting to the evolving environment while maintaining low prices and broad selection for customers,"" the statement continued.

What Tariffs Mean For Prices

Before the lower tariffs cleared the path to Prime Day, Flaus, the electric flosser maker, was considering moving some inventory into a ""bonded"" warehouse that allows importers to defer custom payments, Coxe told the Wall Street Journal in late April. The company had concerns that its existing stock would last to Prime Day. Flaus sells directly through its website and on Amazon.

The agreement to lower tariffs cleared the path to Prime Day. Coxe said the company has the margins to absorb the 30% tariff rate and is not planning to increase prices. ""That's a last resort,"" Coxe said.

Other companies also seem to have taken that approach when it comes to price increases.

""There was very much a view of, 'Let's wait it out,'"" Scott Needham, CEO of data analytics platform SmartScout, told IBD. ""Let's see if it'll change and not make any drastic changes that we can't reverse.""

SmartScout serves independent sellers and brands that use the Amazon platform. About 4,000 top-selling products on Amazon were at all-time high prices on the day the U.S.-China tariff deal was announced, according to SmartScout data. That's out of a sample of about 130,000, Needham said.

Big retailers have offered mixed views on prices. Amazon had not seen an increase in average selling price across the platform, Jassy said at the company's annual shareholder meeting in May. He said he also has not seen any ""attenuation,"" or slowing, of consumer demand despite the uncertainty.

But Rainey, Walmart's CFO, told CNBC in May that tariffs are ""still too high"" even after the deal with China. Consumers will start seeing higher prices, he warned.

Why Raising Prices Is Politically Risky

That view triggered a strong reaction from the Trump administration, which maintains that the tariff push can rebalance global trade without leaving U.S. consumers with sticker shock. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS News in June that some companies, including Amazon and Home Depot, had said they will avoid price hikes.

Raising prices can be politically risky. After Walmart's commentary, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Walmart should ""EAT THE TARIFFS."" The Trump administration also called Amazon's reported plan to list the tariff cost of products as a ""hostile and political act."" Amazon clarified that it only briefly considered listing tariff costs for products in its low-cost Haul section.

But the Walmart CFO's comments are ""really important,"" Dan Salmon, an Amazon stock analyst with New Street Research, told IBD. ""Amazon always wants to be very price competitive and, certainly in the U.S., Walmart is the No. 1 competitor they will measure themselves against.""

Will E-Commerce Suppliers Shift To U.S.?

Questions have also been raised about a key goal of the Trump tariffs: boost U.S. manufacturing jobs to make the U.S. less dependent on Chinese manufacturing.

Some sellers on Amazon and elsewhere have worked on diversifying where they manufacture or purchase their goods. That includes weighing which products can be made in the U.S. or elsewhere.

For many, that process started during Trump's first term when he enacted more limited tariffs on Chinese goods, according to Owen Carr, chief merchandising officer at Spreetail, an e-commerce logistics and management company that is among the top third-party sellers on Amazon, Walmart and Target.

But moving supply chains to the U.S. or elsewhere can take three years and require significant resources, Carr told IBD.

It may be doable for some brands or products. ""But you're going to have all these other costs that can get you,"" Carr said. ""And so those are just all factors that you have to work through.""

Navigating Uncertainty For Amazon Stock

Meanwhile, investors continue to work through the tariff turmoil's impact on Amazon stock.

Shares rallied 8% on May 12 after the deal was announced, giving Amazon the highest jump among the Magnificent Seven stocks that day. The stock gained 11% overall in May, its first positive month of trading since January. Shares are down 4% overall in 2025.

Amazon stock is in a cup-with-handle base with a 214.84 buy point, according to IBD MarketSurge. Shares closed about 3% below that entry on Thursday.

Amazon Stock: 2025 Revenue Target Estimate

Amazon's growth estimates from Wall Street have decreased from the start of the year, however. The tech giant beat sales and earnings estimates with its Q1 results. But it gave lower-than-expected operating income guidance.

Analysts project, on average, that Amazon's revenue will grow 8.9% to $694.6 billion this year, according FactSet. That's down 1.7% from the $706.9 billion projected at the start of 2025. Amazon earnings per share for the year are seen growing 12% to $6.19. That's down less than 1% from the $6.23 EPS projection at the start of the year.

Despite the uncertainty, e-commerce stocks have actually outperformed this year. The 59-stock Retail-Internet industry group tracked by IBD ranks 10th among 197 industry groups, based on six-month price performance. The overall group is up 8% year-to-date. However, that has been driven by strong gains from international players such as MercadoLibre (MELI), Sea Ltd. (SE) and Alibaba Group (BABA).

Still, Amazon is pitching itself to investors as a good bet to emerge a winner among retailers in the current tariff environment. Jassy has said Amazon stock gained market share during similar times of disruption, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

""Given our really broad selection, low pricing and speedy delivery, we have emerged from these uncertain eras with more relative market segment share than we started and (are) better set up for the future,"" Jassy told analysts on the May 1 conference call. ""I'm optimistic this could happen again.""

Hoping For 'Digestible' Tariffs

The S&P 500, meanwhile, turned positive year-to-date following the China deal, after sinking to as low as a 18% year-to-date loss on April 8. The index was up 1.5% as of Wednesday.

It helped that other megacap technology stocks joined Amazon stock in posting big rallies in May. Meta Platforms (META) added 18%. Nvidia (NVDA) gained 20%. Microsoft (MSFT) jumped 16% for the month.

Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, said stocks took a big hit from the first wave of tariffs.

The current tariff environment is closer to what the market was expecting, he added. The return to a ""base case"" could allow investors to focus more on the pro-growth measures such as tax cuts that drove the market rally after Trump was elected.

""There is the view that the U.S. economy can digest this,"" Stucky told IBD. ""It may be a couple of quarters of downward pressure on growth and upward pressure on price, but is digestible.""

The SHP is North Carolina’s largest purchaser of medical and pharmaceutical services, covering nearly 750,000 teachers, state employees, legislators, retirees and their dependents.

CVS Caremark has been the SHP’s pharmacy benefit manager since 2017.

Pharmacy benefit managers are typically third-party administrators of prescription drug coverage, hired by employers, health plans and other payers to handle prescription drug claims processing, formularies development and rebate negotiations.

The Treasurer’s Office said in a news release Thursday that 18 months of contract negotiations have resulted in “an untenable impasse” with CVS Caremark, “which potentially endangers the financial well-being of the SHP.”

The SHP is evaluating its options to recover money it says CVS Caremark owes, as well as its future relationship with the insurer.

State Treasurer Brad Briner made the SHP’s precarious financial status a major focus of his first term.

“We have been working hard to address the $500 million deficit the State Health Plan is facing since my first day in office,” Briner said.

“Part of that work includes partnering with organizations who are committed to working alongside us.

“We cannot proceed with vendors who will force the Plan to raise premiums on our state employees by not honoring their contractual obligations.”

However. CVS Caremark said it is “delivering on its contractual promises” and that the SHP agreed in May to extend their contract through 2027.”

“CVS Caremark’s record is clear: we lower the cost of prescription drugs for North Carolina’s teachers and public employees,” the health insurer said.

“According to the SHP, their pharmacy spend thus far in 2025 is $158 million less than initially budgeted. It has chosen to use those savings to help keep member premiums low.”

The SHP claims CVS Caremark has not been providing since 2023 agreed-upon rebates worth in the tens of millions of dollars.

“Caremark’s repeated demands would rewrite the agreed upon contract with the SHP to increase its profits at the direct expense of teachers, state employees, retirees and taxpayers,” according to the Treasurer’s Office.

“Without these corrections, the Plan would face concerns of insolvency or extreme premium increases for Plan members.”

“Prescription drug costs are already sky high. State employees and retirees cannot afford to pay more,” said Ardis Watkins, executive director of State Employees Association of N.C.

“We stand behind their efforts to hold CVS Caremark to their word.”

CVS Caremark said that it “recognizes the State Plan is facing a significant budget shortfall and welcomes the opportunity to work together to create additional savings in their pharmacy spend.”

“To be clear, Caremark has always, and continues to, pass through to the State Health Plan 100% of rebates it receives on drugs used by its members.

“Rebates are a commonly used tool from manufacturers across industries that are essentially a post-sale discount. They are only earned on drugs that are actually purchased and dispensed.”

A key element of dispute is the SHP’s decision in January 2024 to change its pharmacy plan to exclude coverage for Humira and anti-obesity coverage for GLP-1 drugs for its beneficiaries.

Former two-term Treasurer Dale Folwell recommended ending the coverage on April 1, 2024, for 24,749 SHP members prescribed a GLP-1 drug for weight loss.

Folwell claimed that continuing SHP coverage of weight-loss drugs purely for that purpose eventually would bankrupt the SHP. Folwell has projected the SHP facing a $4.2 billion budget gap over the next five years, what he calls “an existential threat.”

CVS Caremark said that “we do not dispute their right to change their formulary.”

“But, the State Health Plan is demanding that it continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates tied to drugs they chose to exclude when they changed their plan design.”

“In a show of good faith and partnership throughout this dispute, we have continued to pay the SHP.

“Continuing to pay this windfall is unsustainable.”

“Our millions of African subscribers will benefit from a unique offer, bringing together the best of Canal+ and Netflix content in a joint package,” said Pascale Chabert, chief content acquisition officer of Canal+, in a statement.
Emma Lloyd, vp, partnerships EMEA at Netflix, said the Canal+ deal “will allow us to reach even more people across French-speaking African countries.
It’s a big win for entertainment fans and part of our ongoing mission to make the member experience even better.” The Canal+ deal follows similar distribution agreements between Canal+ and Netflix for Poland and France.","Canal+ has signed a first-of-its-kind distribution deal with Netflix that will see the French pay-TV player carry Netflix content for countries across Sub-Saharan Africa.

Starting next month, Canal+ will offer its subscribers across 24 French-speaking African countries Netflix original content, from global hits such as Stranger Things, Money Heist, Squid Game, and Emily in Paris, to the streamer’s African production slate, which includes South Africa drama Blood & Water, Nigerian series Blood Sisters, and reality series Young Famous and African.

Canal+ is already a leading player in Africa, with operations in 25 countries through 16 subsidiaries and reported 8 million subscribers. The French group currently operates 28 pay-TV channels dedicated to African audiences. The French group is currently in the process of acquiring pan-African pay-TV group MultiChoice, the continent’s largest pay-TV player, which operates in 50 countries with 19.3 million subscribers.

Netflix does not break out its subscriber figures for Africa, combining them in the larger Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, but the streamer is estimated to have fewer than 5 million subscribers on the continent, with the vast majority of those in the English-speaking countries of South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya.

“Our millions of African subscribers will benefit from a unique offer, bringing together the best of Canal+ and Netflix content in a joint package,” said Pascale Chabert, chief content acquisition officer of Canal+, in a statement. “This new agreement demonstrates Canal+’s ability to extend its unique super-aggregation model beyond the European continent.”

During the pandemic-era streaming boom, Netflix, along with other global streamers, invested heavily in original African content in a bid to boost subscriber numbers and touted the continent, with its low streaming penetration rates and large, young population, as a future growth market. However, as Wall Street has changed its metric of success from subscriber growth to revenue per user, Africa slipped out of focus for the global streamers. Unlike Amazon Prime, which cut its investment in original programming on the continent, Netflix continues to back African originals, with such South African series as Kings of Jo’Burg and Fatal Seduction.

Emma Lloyd, vp, partnerships EMEA at Netflix, said the Canal+ deal “will allow us to reach even more people across French-speaking African countries. It’s a big win for entertainment fans and part of our ongoing mission to make the member experience even better.”

This week, Kroger paid out a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share to its shareholders, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable income stock.
Analysts are watching closely, with many expecting earnings of $1.44 per share this quarter—slightly higher than last year.
As legal proceedings continue, the outcome of this attempted merger could redefine the future of the American supermarket landscape.
For now, Kroger is focused on delivering steady value to its shareholders—a message that will no doubt be reinforced in its upcoming earnings call.","Kroger continues to demonstrate resilience and strategic focus as it prepares for its first-quarter 2025 earnings call, scheduled for 20 June. Despite ongoing market fluctuations and a tough retail landscape, the company remains committed to shareholder value through steady dividends, share buybacks, and a long-term vision that merges physical retail with digital innovation. This week, Kroger paid out a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share to its shareholders, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable income stock. Since reinstating its dividend in 2006, the company has delivered a compounded annual growth rate of 13.5% in shareholder payouts.

Digital sales are emerging as a major growth engine for the retailer. In 2024, Kroger reported an 18% increase in digital orders, which now not only contribute to higher basket sizes but also deliver stronger profit margins. Coupled with a $1 billion share repurchase programme, Kroger is signalling to investors that it intends to stay ahead in a sector defined by slim margins and rising expectations. Analysts are watching closely, with many expecting earnings of $1.44 per share this quarter—slightly higher than last year. “Kroger has shown it knows how to evolve without losing its identity,” said one retail analyst in New York. “They’re balancing tech, tradition, and financial discipline in a way that’s rare for legacy grocers.”

The company’s share price currently sits at $66.24, having dipped around 9% since reaching a 2025 high of nearly $73 in April. This modest decline is seen by many investors as an entry point, particularly with the earnings report just weeks away.

However, not everything is smooth sailing. Kroger is still facing legal and regulatory scrutiny over its proposed $24.6 billion merger with rival Albertsons. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission moved earlier this year to block the deal, citing concerns over competition and potential price increases for consumers. In addition to the regulatory pushback, Kroger is now also facing lawsuits from several parties arguing the merger would harm workers and reduce consumer choice.

Despite the setbacks, Kroger remains publicly committed to the merger, insisting it would lower prices, create new union jobs, and allow the combined company to better compete with giants like Walmart and Amazon. As legal proceedings continue, the outcome of this attempted merger could redefine the future of the American supermarket landscape. For now, Kroger is focused on delivering steady value to its shareholders—a message that will no doubt be reinforced in its upcoming earnings call.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-download-4-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 01:58:15.937936

However, at this year’s annual meeting, which was held June 5, he failed to secure a majority of votes from shareholders.
“On June 5, 2025, Mr. Hoag offered his resignation from the Board, conditioned upon Board acceptance,” the filing says.
“Directors who do not attend their board and committee meetings cannot be effective representatives of shareholders,” the ISS report says.
ISS had recommended that WBD shareholders vote against the plan.","Netflix‘s board of directors will meet in the coming weeks to decide whether to accept or reject the resignation of the company’s lead independent director, Jay Hoag.

Hoag, a venture capitalist and founding General Partner at Technology Crossover Ventures, has served on Netflix’s board since 1999, and in addition to being lead independent director is also chair of its nominating and governance committee.

However, at this year’s annual meeting, which was held June 5, he failed to secure a majority of votes from shareholders. Per a company policy that was adopted last year, if a director does not secure a majority of votes, they are expected to submit their resignation, and the board will then meet to decide whether to accept it. Per an SEC filing Friday, Hoag submitted his resignation.

“On June 5, 2025, Mr. Hoag offered his resignation from the Board, conditioned upon Board acceptance,” the filing says. “In accordance with the Resignation Policy, the Nominating and Governance Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board will consider Mr. Hoag’s resignation and recommend to the Board regarding whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action.”

The board will have 90 days to decide whether to accept or reject the resignation.

Hoag’s voting result was likely due to a recommendation from the influential shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, which recommended against voting for Hoag in its report on Netflix, which it published last month. ISS said that because he attended only attended 50 percent of board meetings, “support for Jay Hoag is not considered warranted due to poor attendance.”

ISS generally advises against supporting board members that do not attend at least 75 percent of meetings.

“Directors who do not attend their board and committee meetings cannot be effective representatives of shareholders,” the ISS report says. “When a director fails to attend at least 75 percent of the aggregate of his or her board and committee meetings, adverse vote recommendations will be issued with respect to that director in the absence of a valid reason.”

It is worth noting that in the five years before 2024, Hoag’s rate of attendance was 97 percent, and it is 100 percent so far this year, suggesting that last year was an anomaly.

A continued potential for strikes King Soopers workers have twice picketed over contract negotiations since the COVID pandemic.
Prior to that, the last time King Soopers workers carried out a strike was 1996, coincidentally the last time Safeway workers authorized a strike as well.","DENVER — If union leaders don’t agree with a proposal from Safeway executives this weekend, workers at Safeway stores across Colorado could strike next week.

Their potential strike comes as the union representing them sits down for negotiations with Safeway’s competitor Kroger, the parent company of King Soopers. Sunday marks the end of an extended 100-day strike stand down following a brief work stoppage in February. If a deal isn’t reached this weekend, King Soopers workers could hit the picket lines next week as well.

Though the leader of the union said she hopes that isn’t the case.

“I want to make sure consumers have a place to shop,” UFCW Local 7 president Kim Cordova told 9NEWS Consumer Investigator Steve Staeger.

The Safeway strike vote comes as workers there have been working under an extension of a contract that expired in January. Cordova accused the company of recently backing away from a signed agreement that would have provided employees retroactive pay dating back to January according to any terms of a new agreement.

Since the workers continue under a contract extension with a no-strike clause, they would be required to provide the company with 72 hours' notice of their intent to end the contract extension and begin a strike, Cordova told 9NEWS. She said the union gave Safeway until noon Friday to agree to a proposal. She said she hadn’t yet returned a phone call to Safeway Albertsons brass around 3 p.m. Friday.

In a statement to 9NEWS, Safeway Albertsons said it remains committed to productive conversations with the union and insists all stores are open.

Cordova accused Safeway Albertsons of colluding in negotiations with their competitor King Soopers, repeating allegations in a lawsuit filed against the companies by the Colorado Attorney General last year that attempted to stop a proposed merger between the national grocery giants.

Leaders from King Soopers have a scheduled negotiation with UFCW Local 7 on Saturday and Sunday and the company seems positive about the negotiations.

""We are encouraged by the progress made at the table last week, resulting in tentative agreements on several contract language items and the extension of the Peaceful Resolution Agreement,” King Soopers spokeswoman Jessica Trowbridge told 9NEWS earlier this week. “We are eager to return to the table on Saturday and Sunday and remain committed to reaching a fair agreement that provides competitive pay, affordable healthcare and long-term stability for our associates and the communities we serve. We are hopeful that productive conversations will continue this weekend resulting in an offer for our associates to vote on.""

A continued potential for strikes

King Soopers workers have twice picketed over contract negotiations since the COVID pandemic. Prior to that, the last time King Soopers workers carried out a strike was 1996, coincidentally the last time Safeway workers authorized a strike as well.

But more frequent strikes for the two companies could be possible because of the consolidation of and new competitive nature of the grocery business, according to University of Denver business professor Jack Buffington.

“These unionized supermarkets are always chasing Walmart when it comes to scale and price,” Buffington said. “So that's going to continue to put pressure on the workforce, which is going to, I think, continue to lead to potential for strikes. I don't see how this changes.”

In both negotiations, Cordova said workers are fighting reductions in pension and healthcare benefits, and arguing for increased staffing to lessen the ever-growing load on grocery store employees.

Cordova noted her union has found pricing discrepancies caused by understaffing — a recent plea by the unions prompted an investigation by our partners at Consumer Reports and other news outlets that found prices at the register often don’t match prices marked on store shelves.

But Buffington said pressures to reduce overhead in an industry with tight margins will make staffing arguments a tough sell.

“The workers are concerned about those pressures from the store and trying to reduce their number of people who work at a store, reducing their health care costs and pensions, which has been something that's been rumored as a part of negotiation,” Buffington said.

“I don't think negotiations are going to impact the number of workers, because they just can't afford it with their operating margins.”

Buffington said unionized grocers are between a rock and a hard place.

“On one side they're in between like a Walmart, which is, you know, the super behemoth low-cost provider,” he said. “And on the other side, which is the hard place, is the whole Amazon, Whole Foods model, which is more convenience, more selection, you know, buying things online, so you know, so you know, they're kind of lost.”",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/34c16d10-c94e-40ae-9912-de5900731a90/20250606T233719/34c16d10-c94e-40ae-9912-de5900731a90_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 01:58:20.692150

The property insurance landscape has been undergoing a dramatic transformation in the last five years, with catastrophic events occurring with greater frequency and in unexpected locations. This evolution is forcing insurance professionals to reconsider traditional approaches to risk assessment and coverage.

“The nature of property risk has been evolving over the past several years, with an increasing severity and frequency of catastrophe losses. This shift has altered how the marketplace perceives and approaches property insurance,” said Tonya Courtney, senior vice president of Nationwide E&S Brokerage Property.

Recent events highlight this changing dynamic. Hurricane Helene caused severe flooding in Asheville, North Carolina—an area situated more than 250 miles to the coast where such extensive damage would typically not be anticipated in the wake of a windstorm.

“When underwriting hurricane losses, the focus is usually within a 50-mile radius of the coast, where the greatest impact from a named windstorm event is expected. However, Hurricane Helene defied these expectations, causing widespread damage in Asheville and catching everyone by surprise,” Courtney explained.

This pattern of unexpected catastrophes extends beyond hurricanes. What the industry describes as “secondary perils” are now driving significant losses.

“While the E&S market has traditionally focused on named windstorm as the primary peril, convective storms were the primary driver of property losses in 2023,” Courtney noted. “We must also consider the impact of other perils, such as wildfire, which wasn’t a significant issue before the Tubbs Fire in 2017 caused over 5 billion dollars in property losses.

The financial impact of these events is staggering. According to Courtney, catastrophic events have exceeded $100 billion in insured property damage worldwide since 2017 and are expected to worsen.

Evolving Underwriting Practices and Market Shifts

As risks evolve, so too must underwriting approaches. The Excess and Surplus (E&S) market is seeing increased business flow as standard markets have struggled with the changing risk landscape. The shift gained momentum around 2018 when the standard lines property market hardened considerably as a result of losses from Harvey, Irma, Maria, and California wildfires.

The increasing frequency and severity of losses and increasing valuation of buildings make it difficult for a single carrier to handle such large exposures. “Post-COVID, building materials and labor costs have exploded, further exacerbating the situation. “For example, a hospital valued at $2 billion may be covered with a $750 million loss limit from the standard market, which is a significant exposure for one carrier,” Courtney explained.

The E&S market offers a solution by spreading risk across multiple carriers. “The E&S market can spread the risk by taking smaller portions of the exposure. A $5 million loss is more manageable for a single carrier than a $750 million loss,” Courtney said.

This shift has prompted E&S underwriters to adapt their risk assessment practices. “E&S carriers are becoming more diligent in utilizing data analytics to evaluate and underwrite property exposures. They are not simply offering high limits on every risks without an in-depth and thorough understanding of the risk and potential for loss, “Courtney explained. “Valuation is a key focus, and underwriters are relying on sound valuation tools in lieu of stated values on property applications as accurate valuation is crucial for setting PMLs, determining attachment points, limits, and deductibles. Roof scores have also become an important underwriting requirement, especially for coastal risks.

“Wind loss prevention relies heavily on the roof as a first line of defense,” Courtney noted.

The Critical Role of Relationships and Prevention

In this volatile environment, strong relationships between brokers, carriers, and clients have never been more important. Trust and consistency are the foundation of successful partnerships in the insurance industry.

“In the current landscape, fostering strong partnerships is absolutely essential. Carriers must go beyond pricing risk and position themselves as strategic partners in risk mitigation and portfolio resilience.

For brokers navigating this complex market, Courtney recommends working with carriers that are transparent, collaborate on loss prevention, and have dedicated underwriters that are known in the industry as trusted advisors.

“It’s crucial to work with underwriters who have the expertise and knowledge to provide consistent, strong programs year after year,” she advised. “Anyone can put a policy on the books, but the real value lies in the underwriter’s ability to deliver reliable coverage without sudden changes or surprises.”

This consistency builds trust, which becomes particularly valuable during market fluctuations. ” Courtney said.

This collaborative approach to prevention not only protects policyholders but also contributes to the long-term stability of insurance companies. By working together to identify and address potential hazards before incidents occur, the industry can better navigate the increasingly complex risk landscape.

“To address this, we must evolve our thinking and approach to align with the changing market and global conditions,” Courtney concluded. “Collaboration and innovation within the industry are crucial to tackling these challenges effectively.”

Dofasco plant a 'crown jewel' While Joly toured the Hamilton plant Friday, Carney introduced new legislation to eliminate federal barriers to internal trade and enable more infrastructure projects to be approved faster.
The federal government is working on a plan to help companies financially in the short-term to prevent layoffs, Joly said.
Joly said diplomatic efforts with the Trump administration are ongoing and increasing Canada's retaliatory tariffs on American products is still an option.","Since Minister Mélanie Joly took over the infrastructure portfolio last month, she and Dofasco CEO Ron Bedard have spoken every day about how the U.S. trade war is impacting Hamilton's steel industry.

""I can't emphasize enough how determined she has been in every meeting on taking care of workers,"" Bedard told a crowd of workers at the company's plant in Hamilton on Friday, alongside Joly and local politicians.

""It's unlike anything I've seen in my 38-year career. And the fact that she's here today wanting to understand what more she can do speaks volumes about how committed she is to our industry and our people.""

Before Friday, Bedard had rarely spoken publicly about ArcelorMittal Dofasco's efforts to get the federal government's help as Canada's trade war with the U.S. escalates.

Joly's visit to Dofasco came a few days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order increasing tariffs of steel and aluminum from 25 to 50 per cent.

On Thursday, Canadian steel executives met with officials in Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal government, including Joly, to press for urgent assistance.

""It is clear that the government is seized with the gravity of the situation facing Canadian steel and understands the need for expediency in responding,"" Canadian Steel Producers Association CEO Catherine Cobden said about the meeting in Ottawa in a statement.

Dofasco plant a 'crown jewel'

While Joly toured the Hamilton plant Friday, Carney introduced new legislation to eliminate federal barriers to internal trade and enable more infrastructure projects to be approved faster.

These projects will include power lines and pipelines, and building up the defence industry, all of which will require steel that's made in Canada, Joly said. Much of that steel comes from Hamilton.

""This is a national asset, the crown jewel of the manufacturing sector,"" she said of Dofasco's plant. ""This is our opportunity to not only save jobs, but build jobs.""

The federal government is working on a plan to help companies financially in the short-term to prevent layoffs, Joly said. The government is also going to attempt to stop ""steel dumping,"" which is when foreign steelmakers sell steel into the Canadian market at ultra-low prices.

""We will have more to say very soon on those two issues,"" Joly told reporters. ""These can't be empty promises. We're in action mode.""

Mayor Andrea Horwath met with Joly Friday and said after that she urged the minister to ""get things moving quite quickly.""

'Hamiltonians are worried,"" Horwath said. ""This is impacting people and families."" She said in a statement earlier this week that the tariffs were putting ""thousands of good jobs at risk.""

Joly said diplomatic efforts with the Trump administration are ongoing and increasing Canada's retaliatory tariffs on American products is still an option.

""Everything is on the table because this is a massive, direct attack on steelworkers,"" she said.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7554931.1749242678!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/melanie-joly.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-06-07 00:00:21.530919

“Together with our affiliated health plans, Elevance Health earnestly funds these scholarships to help address nationwide care provider shortages and improve access to healthcare for everyone,” said Elevance Health Chief Health Officer Shantanu Agrawal.","Alexis McWhorter grew up in London, Kentucky, a city of about 8,000 people in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Eager to give back to the town she says “lovingly” raised her, McWhorter became a family nurse practitioner after earning her degree from Eastern Kentucky University.

“I love building personal therapeutic relationships with my patients and seeing their health improve,” she said. “I think if you are a provider who is invested in your patients’ health, your patients will be more motivated to also invest in themselves.”

McWhorter received one of more than 100 health professional scholarships sponsored by Elevance Health-affiliated plans and awarded in 17 states and the District of Columbia* since 2017. The scholarships – totaling more than $9 million so far – intend to alleviate the shortage of healthcare providers in rural and other under-resourced communities.

Scholarships Support Students Pursuing Careers as Health Professionals

Scholarship recipients pursue careers as primary care physicians, mental health and substance use disorder providers, certified nurse midwives, social workers and more. Typical arrangements require recipients to agree to work in a rural or under-resourced community for two or three years after they graduate.

“I always knew I wanted to be in a career where I could become a servant leader to positively impact the health of those around me,” McWhorter said. “I truly feel invested in their care and health and want to inspire them to become invested in their health as well.”

As a family nurse practitioner (FNP), which is a specific type of advanced practice registered nurse, McWhorter specializes in providing continuous and comprehensive healthcare to people of all ages. FNPs perform physical exams, order diagnostic tests, prescribe medications, treat injuries, and help to prevent and manage chronic illnesses.

The scholarships cover tuition and expenses, and in some instances, may be used to cover other costs that could be barriers to furthering education such as childcare or rent.

“These scholarships present opportunities to people who may not have them otherwise,” McWhorter said. “Especially being grown by the Appalachian community myself, I think it is safe to say that many people in our community do not have the financial resources to pursue higher education.”

Health Professionals Practicing in Rural Areas Improve Access to Care

With higher levels of poverty and food insecurity, people living in rural areas experience barriers to health that can lead to higher rates of chronic health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and heart disease. Most of Kentucky’s 120 counties are designated as health professional shortage areas, where people have to travel long distances to get care.

“My family members traveled more than an hour for appointments to see specialists,” McWhorter said. Her grandfather’s black lung disease eventually developed into lung cancer. Traveling long distances with that kind of illness “can cause a lot of stress for a patient who is already going through so much.”

McWhorter notes that social drivers of health – such as unreliable transportation – are often a significant barrier to care in rural areas.

“That can really impact someone’s ability to function with work, school, and home as well as attend routine health appointments or routine screenings. In my opinion, that alone makes it even more important to extend our work in rural areas,” McWhorter said.

Scholarships are offered to students who aspire to practice medicine in rural, frontier, and other under-resourced communities.

Dive Brief:

Clothing brands H&M and Eileen Fisher achieved the top ranking on a new scorecard that evaluated how some of the biggest fashion companies are progressing on phasing out fossil fuels.

The scorecard from climate group Stand.earth graded 42 fashion brands on a scale of “A+” to “F” based on progress they made to decarbonize their supply chains between 2021 and 2023. The group accounted for impact across five areas: clean energy transition; sustainability commitments and transparency; climate advocacy and engagement; use of low-carbon materials and circularity; and adoption of green shipping methods.

H&M led the list with an overall score of “B+,” followed by Eileen Fisher with a “B-.” Meanwhile six brands earned an “F,” including fast fashion retailers Shein and Boohoo and sports apparel producers Under Armour and Columbia.

Dive Insight:

The report is the follow-up to Stand.earth’s 2023 Fossil Free Fashion Scorecard; the climate group did not publish an edition last year. H&M ranked first in the previous scorecard as well, with an overall score of “B-,” while Eileen Fisher had a “C” and has since moved up due to its progress in sustainable strategy and decarbonization across its operations.

Stand.earth’s latest report noted that production of clothing linked to fossil fuels contributed at least 4% of global emissions in 2024, echoing other comments sustainability experts have made about the fashion industry’s impact on global warming and increased emissions.

“The fashion industry must urgently correct course by ending its dependency on fossil fuels for manufacturing, transportation, and raw materials,” the June 3 report said. “Rapid, just, and worker-centered action by brands has never been more essential for an industry that remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Stand.earth’s analysis of the brands’ environmental impact found that Shein increased its scope 3 emissions by over 170% in a span of just two years, overall emitting almost as much pollution as the entire country of Lebanon. The report also said clothing brands Abercrombie & Fitch, Aritzia and Columbia had yet to set a target for scope 3 emissions, a void that put them behind their competitors and “dangerously out of step with climate action.”

The climate group said the lack of any brands scoring an “A” grade “reflects the reality that the industry has a lot of work left to do to end its close symbiosis with the harmful fossil fuel industry.”

A 2021 World Economic Forum report found that the fashion industry and its supply chain were the world’s third-largest polluter. A separate study from the European Parliament states that the sector emitted almost 10% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions annually, more than those generated by international flights and maritime shipping combined.

If the fashion industry continues on its current trajectory, it is estimated it will use up more than 26% of the world’s carbon budget in efforts to limit global warming to an additional 2°C by 2050, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Leaders from the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology (NSCEB) and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center said this week that expanding workforce training and strengthening partnerships with local universities are key steps to support the sector, which they noted has national security implications

“We recognize the growth potential in biotech,” Dr. Michelle Rozo, vice chair of NSCEB, told the Carolina Journal. “We are just at the beginning of an influx of manufacturing demand for biotech products.”

North Carolina was one of the first states on NSCEB’s Biotech Across America Road Tour. During this tour, the commission will meet with lawmakers in various states to discuss investment opportunities and ways to expand the biotech industry within each state.

“In the last 18 months alone, we’ve seen $11 billion of announced investments and the intent to create over 5,000 new jobs; 93% of this will be at life sciences manufacturing sites,” Dr. Rowley, VP of life sciences economic development for NC Biotechnology Center, told the Carolina Journal. “This is something that is a historic strength for us and continues to be a strength as we move ahead. We’ve created an ecosystem that enables companies that are new to our market, like Genentech and Johnson & Johnson, as well as those that have called our state home for a long time (…) to make billion-dollar advancements and expansions here.

The commission has made recommendations to Congress, outlined in their recent report, Charting the Future of Biotechnology, which highlights the importance of the biotech industry to national security. According to Dr. Rozo, the United States is well behind China, which has prioritized biotech at the federal level for the last 20 years. Biotech, like AI and semiconductors, should be treated as a national security priority. The report lays out a blueprint for action and investing $15 billion over five years.

One of North Carolina’s most prominent investors is Fujifilm, headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Fujifilm has invested $8 billion in the global contract manufacturing organization (CMO) life sciences space. Half of that, or $4 billion, has been invested in the state of North Carolina, and more than three-quarters of that ($3.2 billion) has been invested in the Holly Springs region, according to Crystal Vanuch, head of government affairs for Fujifilm.

Life science CMOs in North Carolina include Novo Nordisk, Genentech, Amgen, and many more. Genentech and Amgen are companies funded partly by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG). Both are based in Holly Springs. Amgen broke ground on its expansion in January, but Genentech has not yet broken ground on its facility. If plans for the company move forward, this would be the first Genentech footprint in North Carolina.

Workforce development programs in the state would provide the necessary staff to support investments such as Genentech, Amgen, and many more companies with manufacturing facilities within the state.

Experts at NCSEB and the NC Biotechnology Center, which hosted NSCEB for a discussion earlier this week, have noted that workforce development training is one of the keys to expanding the already existing investment in biotechnology manufacturing in the state of North Carolina.

“I think locally in North Carolina, we are fortunate to have several well-established training programs, but continue to leverage our systems approach to allow for this programs to expand into additional parts of the state as the need demands,” said Dr. Rowley. “Also putting an effort into awareness to ensure that high school students understand the accessibility that exists, especially in biomanufacturing roles, that it does not require an advanced degree or anything beyond their high school diploma. We are increasingly leaning into the Career and College Promise Program that allows high school students, at no cost to them, to take some of the certificate programs while still in high school and then be prepared upon graduation to enter into those roles.”

Officials say developing workforce programs focused on biotech manufacturing could help strengthen North Carolina’s position in the industry, which has been identified as important to national security.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/biotech_manufacturing-768x512.jpeg,N,,2025-06-07 01:02:20.409213

Trump-era tariffs on wool imports are raising costs for textiles prized by luxury fashion houses worldwide.

In December 1957, Reverend Murdoch MacRae traveled from his parish on Lewis and Harris—one of the Outer Hebridean islands off the northwest coast of mainland Scotland—across the Atlantic to confront the US Federal Trade Commission in Washington.

At the time, President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s tariffs on woolen imports threatened to trigger an exodus of island workers whose livelihoods depended on producing hand-woven tweed jackets, trousers and caps—garments long cherished by Americans, from Wall Street bankers to the Kennedys and Hollywood actors. MacRae’s mission to protect the islanders from US protectionism ultimately succeeded.

Yet nearly 70 years later, his achievement is being undermined by the trade policies of another figure with Hebridean roots: .

“Trump might portray himself as a man of Scottish heritage; he might have used the family Bible at his inauguration,” says Iain Martin, a fourth-generation weaver, but “that man doesn’t care. He’s out for himself, nobody else.”

Martin is one of just 150 weavers of Harris Tweed, a fabric made from coarse, woven wool. It has been his life. He started winding bobbins—a now semi-automated part of the process essential for loading yarn onto the loom—when he was five. Now, at age 57, he weaves about 8,000 meters of tweed each year, in addition to managing a 15-acre farm and caring for 600 sheep. He still uses a loom purchased by his grandfather in 1926, housed in a workshop alongside his own stack of family Bibles, a collection of colorful bobbins and a heavy blanket hand-woven by his grandmother.

The distinctive diagonal-patterned Harris Tweed, unique to the Hebrides, has become part of the collateral damage caused by the US president’s sweeping tariffs on global trade—measures he defends as necessary to protect American jobs. Though tweed exports are small compared to the £59.3 billion total value of UK goods shipped to the US, the island’s crofters and weavers still face the same 10% tariff rate imposed on much larger exporters, even after Trump’s deal with the UK government reduced levies for some other sectors. They now compete under the same terms as major companies such as automaker Jaguar Land Rover Ltd, Plc, the consumer products group, and fashion brand Group Plc.

Islanders warn, as MacRae did seven decades ago, that these tariffs threaten a way of life rooted in the 18th century, on remote islands that today are home to around 26,000 people—most of them living on Lewis and Harris.

The US president’s mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was once one of those islanders. She grew up in Lewis before emigrating to New York at age 17 in 1930.

“A lot of islanders go to work elsewhere and they never return home, but for people like me, crofting, weaving—it’s in the blood,” says Martin. “That’s what draws me to keeping these traditions alive.”

sparks a tweed renaissance

A 1993 British act of Parliament protects the manufacture of Harris Tweed, stipulating that producers must use pure sheep’s wool dyed and spun in the Outer Hebrides, weave it by hand at home and finish it in the Western Isles. They then export the fabric to around 55 countries—the US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are the biggest markets—where designers use it in everything from luxury suits to sneakers and even whisky flasks.

The industry has long been sensitive to the whims of American buyers, whose preferences have had an outsized impact on the sector. In the post-war era, purchasing a tailored tweed suit was a rite of passage for many young men. However, when US consumers turned away from wool in favor of lighter fabrics in the 1980s, Hebridean tweed-makers experienced a sharp downturn. Years later, a limited-edition tweed sneaker by Nike Inc. introduced the fabric to a younger audience, sparking a renaissance in the 2000s.

The once-derelict Shawbost mill, dating back to the 1920s, was reborn as Harris Tweed Hebrides Ltd. in 2007 to capture some of that renewed US interest. Now the largest of the island’s three mills and its biggest private-sector employer, the company generated a turnover of around £9 million in 2023, according to company filings. The US remains its top export market. Approximately 1 million meters of the fabric are produced annually, with the Shawbost mill accounting for about 65% of that total and supplying international brands such as Corp., and Christian SE.

Margaret Ann Macleod, chief executive officer of Harris Tweed Hebrides, describes the 10% tariff as “hugely concerning,” particularly as it comes on top of higher employment taxes in the UK and against a backdrop of slowing global luxury demand.

Demand for the fabric also risks being affected by the high levies the Trump administration imposed on European Union exports. Although the tariffs do not directly impact the Hebridean mills, any increase in the final retail price of garments made with Harris Tweed could prompt US clients to reconsider using the fabric.

Last week, the US Court of International Trade declared the Trump tariffs illegal. However, a successful appeal by the White House has delayed a final decision, leaving those affected by the measures still awaiting clarity.

“The worst thing for buyers is being unsure,” Macleod says. “When there are unknown costs that we can’t quantify, it can make the difference between them selecting a British heritage textile or not. They may choose to delay that purchase, reduce the quantity or opt out entirely.”

About 15% of Harris Tweed Hebrides' annual fabric production is already sold to Asian clients. The mill is now working to strengthen ties with markets such as South Korea—its fastest-growing market—and Japan, which Macleod will visit later this year as part of a British trade delegation. The company is also reviewing its prices—the cloth retails at £55 per meter for individual consumers—in response to the tariffs.

Yet quickly pivoting to new markets is not easy for a “slow fashion” business, where completing an order can take up to three months. The industry must also step up efforts to combat counterfeiting and raise brand awareness in newer markets like China.

“We’re not going to offshore production; we legally cannot do that even if we wanted to,” says Calum Iain Maciver, interim chief executive officer of the Harris Tweed Authority, a statutory body responsible for protecting the cloth’s reputation. “Returning manufacturing plants to the USA is Trump’s goal, but so many industries are caught up in that. It’s quite a blunt instrument to try to solve a domestic American problem; it really is a sledgehammer.”

By considering both technological maturity and deployment context, the report identifies 23 high-potential combinations drawn from over 230 subcomponents across eight critical domains: artificial intelligence, omni computing, engineering biology, spatial intelligence, robotics, advanced materials, next-generation energy and quantum technologies.

While the framework focuses on the impact of technology combinations over individual breakthroughs, it highlights AI as a key enabler, making many of these synergies commercially viable. Several standout combinations demonstrate the transformative potential of technology convergence across sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, energy and transportation, including:

Agentic AI, spatial intelligence and robotic advancements in manipulation and adaptive control are enabling autonomous systems to make intelligent decisions in complex environments, driving progress in automotive and smart manufacturing.

Advances in sensor networks and AI simulation systems are enhancing digital twins, enabling more integrated, end-to-end impact, and expanding their efficiency and applicability across sectors from aerospace to healthcare.

By combining quantum capabilities with the reliability of classical systems, this approach is already unlocking quantum’s potential in finance, molecular simulation and complex optimization.

Predictive modelling and transformers are accelerating R&D in advanced materials by enabling virtual testing of combinations and structures before synthesizing them in a lab, driving more efficient development cycles in manufacturing, chemicals and beyond.

“The question is not about whether technology convergence will reshape industries. That journey has already begun. The real challenge is how companies can position themselves to be champions of convergence,” says Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini.

This report serves as a practical guide for leaders seeking to turn insight into action, calling for a systems-thinking approach, balanced investments across tech maturity stages, value chain repositioning and ecosystem readiness. It combines qualitative and quantitative insights from the World Economic Forum’s Technology Convergence Community, composed of subject matter experts from the Forum’s global network of business, academic, civil society, public sector leaders, who provided domain expertise and case studies. This was complemented by Capgemini’s global survey of 2,000 senior executives across 18 countries, 10 industries and five continents.

The World Economic Forum’s Technology Convergence Initiative maps and connects the emerging technology landscape, spanning AI, quantum computing, biotechnology, spatial computing, robotics, and beyond. It aims to support the development of actionable insights and tools that help technologists, policy-makers, economists and business leaders design systems, structure organizations and scale solutions beyond the scope of a single technology for broader societal value.

“We know from experience that reliance upon voluntary notifications to the FDA about device supply chain disruptions has not been effective,” Michelle adds.
Building a proactive system The issues plaguing the US’ medical device supply chain are not isolated.
What’s clear is that a reactive approach to medical device supply chains is not working.
Engaging stakeholders from every level of the supply chain allows early risk identification and builds trust in public health systems.","Earlier this year, it was reported that medical device shortages are leaving hospitals across the US without critical tools for neonatal and paediatric patients. The consequences are severe, often forcing clinicians to make substitutions or delay care, but the shortages are not caused by any single point of failure. Instead, they stem from deeper structural weaknesses.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it is increasingly concerned about the impact of these shortages. Its data shows that, while disruptions to adult device supply chains can usually be absorbed, shortages in paediatrics can cause far more disruption. That’s partly because fewer manufacturers make these specialised devices and production is often not prioritised due to low profit margins. However, there exists a wider issue: the system for identifying and responding to supply chain problems is fragmented.

Where engagement fails, shortages follow

Stakeholder engagement is vital to ensure a strong supply chain, with each supplier, manufacturer, regulator and NGO playing a different role. Some act as drivers, setting expectations or applying pressure; others are facilitators, offering resources or expertise; then some act as inspectors who ensure standards are met and risks are properly managed.

Engaging with these groups is essential to building resilience. The earlier a manufacturer or regulator hears about an issue – whether it be raw material shortages or cyber attacks – the faster a coordinated response can be put in place. It also makes collaboration during crises more effective because relationships and lines of communication already exist.

Michelle Tarver, Director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), explains: “While the vulnerabilities in the medical device supply chain are not new, we're growing increasingly concerned that the rise in shortages is having a significant adverse impact on neonatal and paediatric patients.”

Without adequate stakeholder input, the FDA only learns about shortages when they reach hospitals.

“In recent months,” Michelle continues “the FDA has had to rely mostly on hearing about medical device shortages from healthcare providers and clinical professional societies. Given this often occurs at the point-of-care, it is typically far too late to put measures into place that would otherwise avert these shortages.”

For example, in 2022 the US experienced a shortage of paediatric tracheostomy tubes. Triggered by production problems and sterilisation delays, the lack of early alerts for the shortage meant hospitals had to improvise by reusing devices beyond recommended limits or substituting adult versions – increasing the risk of complications.

Engaging stakeholders through formal supply chain partnerships, community forums or real-time inventory data sharing helps build trust in these scenarios and allows innovation from the ground up. Clinicians can point out usability issues with devices whilst NGOs can highlight ethical concerns in sourcing and governments can respond with policy support.

The pitfalls of reactive regulation

One of the core reasons the FDA struggles to act early is because it lacks the authority to require advance notification of medical device shortages, except during an official public health emergency. In contrast, the European Union introduced a rule in January 2025 requiring manufacturers to notify regulators of anticipated shortages, a proactive model which gives governments more time to intervene.

“We know from experience that reliance upon voluntary notifications to the FDA about device supply chain disruptions has not been effective,” Michelle adds. “We are often the last to know and by then the consequences are already being felt in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and children’s hospitals.”

To improve matters, the FDA created the Office of Supply Chain Resilience (OSCR). The OSCR performs risk assessments, collaborates with manufacturers and coordinates emergency production efforts. When tracheostomy tubes ran short, the OSCR used the Defence Production Act to expedite raw material supply and issued guidance to help hospitals identify safe alternatives. However, without stronger regulatory tools, these interventions happen after the fact.

There has been some support for this type of regulation, but so far this is inconsistent. With no amendments passed, Michelle says: “Failing to ensure the US government and healthcare providers in the US have the same information as our European counterparts poses harm to providers, patients, caregivers and consumers in the US.”

Trade policies and political cuts

Beyond supply chain engagement and reporting, global trade policies are also shaping the availability of medical devices and drugs.

The majority of ingredients for generic drugs in the US, including 95% of ibuprofen and nearly all acetaminophen, come from China. If tariffs are imposed or diplomatic tensions escalate, these products may become more expensive and difficult to obtain.

Gene Seroka, Executive Director of the Port of Los Angeles, says he is already seeing a steep fall in Chinese imports: “We’ll start to see shortages in five to seven weeks if things don’t improve.”

Meanwhile, political uncertainty around the structure of the FDA could pose further risks. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has proposed a reorganisation that includes the loss of 3,500 staff—many of whom are responsible for approving new therapies and monitoring supply chains.

Kennedy has also called for an end to the FDA’s reliance on user fees from pharmaceutical companies, which currently fund nearly half of its US$7.2bn annual budget.

In response, industry bodies have raised concerns. John Murphy of the Association for Accessible Medicines, warns that any combination of tariffs and weakened oversight would “pile onto the factors driving the scarcity,” particularly for lower-cost, high-need medications.

Arthur Wong, Healthcare Managing Director at S&P Global Ratings, notes: “Generics account for roughly 90% of all US prescriptions and tariffs would potentially raise costs for a significant portion of the market.”

Companies like Roche and Merck are preparing for disruptions by increasing domestic investment. Roche has pledged US$50bn in US production over five years and is seeking exemptions for critical imports. However, even with this commitment, executives admit that shifting manufacturing entirely to the US would sharply raise costs.

“Making all goods in the US that are used there would inflate manufacturing costs,” Roche CEO Thomas Schinecker points out.

Building a proactive system

The issues plaguing the US’ medical device supply chain are not isolated. They reflect a broader need for strategic investment, political cooperation and regulatory clarity.

What’s clear is that a reactive approach to medical device supply chains is not working. The FDA and other health bodies need stronger tools – legal authority, financial support and stakeholder input – to move from last-minute crisis management to long-term planning.

Engaging stakeholders from every level of the supply chain allows early risk identification and builds trust in public health systems. Better laws are part of the answer, but so is a shift in culture – to treat resilience as a shared responsibility rather than a task delegated to regulators alone.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e1edbb682c8859b91dbee846b848efa9:226de2a1fe80d854e862218da89c1b6a/screenshot-2025-06-06-114523.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 13:09:33.071163

The Michaels Companies announced on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of Joann's intellectual property and private label brands — in an acquisition that arrives as the Texas-based arts and crafting chain works to expand its own fabric, sewing and yarn offerings.

“We’re honored to have the opportunity to welcome JOANN customers into our creative community and are committed to delivering the selection, value, and inspiration they are looking for at Michaels,” Michaels CEO David Boone said in a statement. The deal, he added, allows the company to better “respond to rising demand” among both new and existing customers.

Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The Associated Press reached out to Michaels for further information on Friday.

With roots dating back to a single Ohio storefront in 1943, Joann had grown into a destination for generations of sewers, quilters, knitters and lovers of other crafts for more than 80 years. But more recently, operational challenges continued to pile up — with the retailer pointing to sluggish consumer demand, inventory shortages and rising competition.

Joann announced it would be going out of business back in February, just one month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year. At the time, the company said financial services company GA Group, together with Joann's term lenders, had been selected as the winning bidder to ""acquire substantially all of Joann's assets"" and conduct going-out-of-business sales at all store locations.

Michaels on Thursday said that its purchase of Joann's IP and private brands included the acquisition of “Big Twist” yarns, which had become a staple in Joann stores over the years.

Those ""Big Twist"" labels are now being developed as part of Michaels' portfolio — and will be available in-stores and online later this year, the company said. In the meantime, Michaels has also dedicated a landing page to welcome former Joann customers online.

And as part of its overall expansion into fabrics, Michaels said on Thursday that its adding more than 600 new products from new and existing brands — including quilting supplies and fabrics, specialty threads, sewing machines and more.

Michaels, founded in 1973, currently operates 1,300 stores across 49 U.S. states and Canada. Its parent company also owns Artistree, a framing merchandise manufacturer.

Dive Brief:

Charlotte-based technology conglomerate Honeywell, Samsung’s engineering subsidiary Samsung E&A, chemicals company Johnson Matthey and chemical engineering firm Gidara Energy have joined together to create a strategic sustainable aviation fuel technology group, Honeywell announced Thursday.

The four companies, organized as the SAF Technology Alliance, aim to create a new technology offering to help scale and deliver a full-service SAF production chain to take the fuel from a waste feedstock to a final product.

The new SAF-focused alliance will look to scale the use of gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch process — a chemical reaction that makes synthesis gas — in SAF production in the near term, according to the release. SAFs still made up less than 1% of global jet fuel use last year and are growing at a ""disappointingly slow” rate, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Dive Insight:

Currently, each of the four companies that compose the alliance have expertise in one or more aspects of the SAF production process, but the group estimates that the combined resources and integrated solution will reduce the time between a feasibility study and facility startup by 15%, according to the June 5 release. The SAF Technology Alliance also said their modular, integrated solutions should reduce capital expenditures by 10%, based on a theoretical schedule and cost analysis conducted by the companies.

Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions CEO Ken West said that the “end-to-end SAF alliance demonstrates the power of collaboration to address the world’s energy demands.” The four companies will create a non-exclusive product for clients that combines Gidara’s expertise in gasification and synthesis gas production; Johnson Matthey’s catalysts and technology to convert syngas to fuels; Honeywell’s technology and digital automation; and Samsung E&A’s expertise in global engineering, procurement, production and project execution.

“As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital,” West said in the release. “This comprehensive alliance provides refiners with a strategic approach to quickly execute their vision.”

Maurits van Tol, CEO of Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies, said the group is looking to target “the common challenges faced by SAF producers” to, ultimately, accelerate global SAF deployment.

The alliance said it will first focus on scaling the use of gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch method because it will enable the use of biomass and municipal solid waste as a feedstock, and such production methods are “increasingly important.” The International Energy Agency estimated in 2023 that waste-, residue- and nonfood energy crop-derived biofuels could meet 40% of all biofuel demand by 2030.

Samsung E&A CEO Hong Namkoong said the combined expertise of the companies will create a “resilient and scalable” SAF supply chain, and Gidara Energy CEO Norbert Kamp said the group will help unlock “the value of waste to meet the growing demand for SAF.”

""We're virtually within walking distance of the center of the city, but we are in a desert,"" said Brad Arthur, pharmacist & owner, Black Rock Pharmacy. ""We're in a health care desert. We're in a pharmacy desert.""

The group is asking the legislature, which is down to its final few days in session, to pass the Patient Access to Pharmacy Protection Act in Albany.

“It's a bipartisan piece of legislation. We're hoping that it gets through,” Giroux said.

The Black Rock pharmacist also warned that medications are the most cost-effective treatment for those who rely on weight loss medications, diabetes drugs and patients on blood thinners.

“Keeping people out of the hospital is critical, so my fear is, what happens next?"" Arthur said. ""I fear that 25 to 30% of all of a sudden begins to explode, because people are home, and if this was their only choice for a pharmacy, they may not opt to get much-needed prescription drugs, and then they end up the street in the hospital. It’s catastrophic.”

The pharmacist was specially calling out State Senator Sean Ryan to support the bill.

A spokesman for Ryan’s office told me that if the bill comes to the Senate floor, Ryan will vote for it.

Now, as local Rite Aids are closing, these pharmacists are being bombarded with prescription requests.

""And we would all love to fill every prescription, but we are going to be the next ones to close our doors,” Latko said.

A long-time Niagara Street Rite Aid customer is now forced to find a new pharmacy.

“It’s disgusting,"" Dayna Banka-Sloan said. ""It's absolutely disgusting. So many of us in the neighborhood rely on this store.”

The independent pharmacists said this is an unnecessary situation and that there is enough money out there to pay for prescription drugs.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2962575/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2F86e%2F1020d6d1597347248f5d62c059a4c7e3%2F86ebf2500f874ef09c96f5ef90a77892%2Fposter_3a91b5f258a64b71852f10302686bd85.png,N,,2025-06-06 19:04:35.391489

The online clothing subscription service saw active subscribers hit an all-time high in its most recent quarter. The recovery is notable after a sharp drop earlier this year as company's efforts to boost customer retention appear to be paying off here. Here to discuss further, we've got Jennifer Hyman, who is the Rent the Runway co-founder and CEO. Jennifer, great to have you here in studio with us. Just take us into your own analysis of this quarter, what really contributed to this performance?

Yes, so loyalty is the highest it's been in four years. Record amount of active subs and record amount of sequential growth in subs. And I think it's because the corporate transformation that we put into place is really working for us.

And so when you talk about that corporate transformation, where are we at and kind of like the you are here of that timeline?

Well, first part of the corporate transformation was last year really proving that we could be a free cash flow break even business. And we proved that the unit economics of this business work. It makes sense financially. And then 2025 is all about growth. And so there were three prongs of that strategy. One is around inventory. We're doubling the amount of new inventory on the platform. Customers are seeing that and they're more loyal because people come to us to have variety in their wardrobes. Second was really about product innovation leading to enhanced customer experience. We've launched tremendous amounts of innovation to the user experience over the past quarter and that's really proof point that the ways that we've simplified our organizational structure and processes have led to like way more agility and ability to kind of iterate fast on behalf of the customer. And then we've gotten much more authentic as it relates to our customers. And as a result of that, um our engagement with marketing. So engagement on social channels is up 163% just in the past quarter.

Wow. Let's talk a little bit more about that customer. As as a person who has seen my fair share of Rent the Runway bags, those navy blue bags make their way in the deliveries into the department here. Who is that core subscriber and who are you planning to expand the reach to from here?

I love that. So I think that we think about the subscriber right now in terms of her aesthetic. And our customer is wanting to be polished. She wants to look sophisticated, playful. She certainly wants to look feminine. And what's interesting about rental now is for the first decade of this business, we had to prove to the consumer and to the brands that like rental was going to be a part of how she got dressed. Now, it's a mainstream behavior and there are many players in the space. And Rent the Runway has the privilege and the freedom to actually compete on aesthetic and to actually compete by nature of the brands that we put onto our platform. So the fact that we're doubling our new inventory this year, we're adding 90 new brands into the portfolio throughout the year, that gives more customers an opportunity to come to the platform, to fall in love with our inventory, and it visually differentiates ourselves from our competitors.

How are you differentiating from those competitors? Newly, Fashion Pass, Armoire, who are out there in the market as well, trying to woo that same customer and client base?

Well, the first part is through the inventory. So Rent the Runway is a much more premium um set of brands that represent just higher end luxury brands. The second way, though, is through the luxury of the customer experience. So our customer, we have a lot of moms on the platform. We have a lot of professional women who do not have time. So therefore, we've launched services like a concierge styling service, at-home pickup, notify me, back in stock notifications that help our customers save time. Because when you're in your 30s and your 40s and you're managing your family, your career, etc., like that's the number one luxury that we can give to you.

Absolutely. And so, as you think about the pricing model around all of this, because we continue to read through some of the consumer confidence reports and really trying to figure out where consumers are are stretching their dollar as much as they possibly can right now. We know the lowest price or one of the offers is roughly $100 a month. Are you seeing customers favor the less expensive tier in this uncertain macro environment that we're in right now?

We're actually not. So we've seen higher growth in our higher price tiers. Of course, we have an a la carte business that does not require a subscription where you can come in, rent a dress for an event starting at just $30, and you get that in two sizes. But what I think is really interesting is that rental is a value play, especially clothing subscription. You're getting thousands of dollars of clothes per month, you're getting it for anywhere between $100 and $150 a month. And as clothing becomes more expensive elsewhere and prices go up because of tariff related pressure, this just creates even more of a value equation. I think it's incredible tailwinds for the rental and resale industries overall.

That kind of touches on something that I was wondering as well with regard to the consumer psyche. We hear more and more about, hey, this could have a tariff type of pricing that's added onto it at the end of the day that might hit your pocket or your pocketbook. As you're thinking about and monitoring those engagements with consumers, how since they and kind of post tariffs, have you seen the consumer psychology change, if at all, among those who are engaging with Rent the Runway?

Yeah. Listen, I think it's not just about tariffs. I think that luxury has fundamentally priced itself out of the market over the post-COVID period of time. And the consumer overall, regardless of her income, is just smarter about how she's spending her money and where she's allocating her money, which creates tremendous opportunity and tailwinds for rental. We're really well situated in this space because we're unlike a traditional retailer in how we acquire inventory. The majority of our inventory is on revenue share with our partners where we don't pay for it upfront. We pay on performance. The reason for that is that brands actually view Rent the Runway as a powerful marketing channel to help them acquire new customers and they see their CACs on Rent the Runway be lower than CACs that they would find on, you know, media channels.

When we were in the break, you said men's is creating a little bit more of an attractive entry point at this juncture than years past.

I think that rental is just mainstream now. So the the goal is to grow, be aggressive and take advantage of the market that we invented.

Great to have you here in studio with us, Jennifer. Appreciate the time.

Thank you so much.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZQkqKHkfZHXA97KCPtIQBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/29831260-42f2-11f0-bf56-c9fd1e38bba0,N,,2025-06-06 20:07:14.606571

“We have been working hard to address the $500 million deficit the State Health Plan is facing since my first day in office,” Briner said.
“We cannot proceed with vendors who will force the Plan to raise premiums on our state employees by not honoring their contractual obligations.” However.","The State Health Plan has halted contract negotiations with CVS Caremark over what the agency is calling a refusal to honor current obligations for its pharmacy benefit manager services.

The SHP is North Carolina’s largest purchaser of medical and pharmaceutical services, covering nearly 750,000 teachers, state employees, legislators, retirees and their dependents.

CVS Caremark has been the SHP’s pharmacy benefit manager since 2017.

Pharmacy benefit managers are typically third-party administrators of prescription drug coverage, hired by employers, health plans and other payers to handle prescription drug claims processing, formularies development and rebate negotiations.

The Treasurer’s Office said in a news release Thursday that 18 months of contract negotiations have resulted in “an untenable impasse” with CVS Caremark, “which potentially endangers the financial well-being of the SHP.”

The SHP is evaluating its options to recover money it says CVS Caremark owes, as well as its future relationship with the insurer.

State Treasurer Brad Briner made the SHP’s precarious financial status a major focus of his first term.

“We have been working hard to address the $500 million deficit the State Health Plan is facing since my first day in office,” Briner said.

“Part of that work includes partnering with organizations who are committed to working alongside us.

“We cannot proceed with vendors who will force the Plan to raise premiums on our state employees by not honoring their contractual obligations.”

However. CVS Caremark said it is “delivering on its contractual promises” and that the SHP agreed in May to extend their contract through 2027.”

“CVS Caremark’s record is clear: we lower the cost of prescription drugs for North Carolina’s teachers and public employees,” the health insurer said.

“According to the SHP, their pharmacy spend thus far in 2025 is $158 million less than initially budgeted. It has chosen to use those savings to help keep member premiums low.”

The SHP claims CVS Caremark has not been providing since 2023 agreed-upon rebates worth in the tens of millions of dollars.

“Caremark’s repeated demands would rewrite the agreed upon contract with the SHP to increase its profits at the direct expense of teachers, state employees, retirees and taxpayers,” according to the Treasurer’s Office.

“Without these corrections, the Plan would face concerns of insolvency or extreme premium increases for Plan members.”

“Prescription drug costs are already sky high. State employees and retirees cannot afford to pay more,” said Ardis Watkins, executive director of State Employees Association of N.C.

“We stand behind their efforts to hold CVS Caremark to their word.”

CVS Caremark said that it “recognizes the State Plan is facing a significant budget shortfall and welcomes the opportunity to work together to create additional savings in their pharmacy spend.”

“To be clear, Caremark has always, and continues to, pass through to the State Health Plan 100% of rebates it receives on drugs used by its members.

“Rebates are a commonly used tool from manufacturers across industries that are essentially a post-sale discount. They are only earned on drugs that are actually purchased and dispensed.”

A key element of dispute is the SHP’s decision in January 2024 to change its pharmacy plan to exclude coverage for Humira and anti-obesity coverage for GLP-1 drugs for its beneficiaries.

Former two-term Treasurer Dale Folwell recommended ending the coverage on April 1, 2024, for 24,749 SHP members prescribed a GLP-1 drug for weight loss.

Folwell claimed that continuing SHP coverage of weight-loss drugs purely for that purpose eventually would bankrupt the SHP. Folwell has projected the SHP facing a $4.2 billion budget gap over the next five years, what he calls “an existential threat.”

CVS Caremark said that “we do not dispute their right to change their formulary.”

“But, the State Health Plan is demanding that it continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates tied to drugs they chose to exclude when they changed their plan design.”

“In a show of good faith and partnership throughout this dispute, we have continued to pay the SHP.

“Continuing to pay this windfall is unsustainable.”

“The Commission has identified measures and practices in the Chinese procurement market that lead to discrimination against EU operators and EU-made supplies,” Olof Gill, commission spokesperson, said Thursday in an emailed statement.

European Union member states this week voted to support a plan to adopt measures that would restrict Chinese medical device makers’ access to the EU market.

The member states took the action, under the EU’s International Procurement Instrument, after concluding an investigation in January that looked at China’s practices in the public procurement market for medical devices.

The investigation found that government practices unfairly encouraged Chinese hospitals to choose domestic manufacturers’ products.

“The Commission has identified measures and practices in the Chinese procurement market that lead to discrimination against EU operators and EU-made supplies,” Olof Gill, commission spokesperson, said Thursday in an emailed statement. “This discrimination also harms both the Chinese healthcare infrastructure, which is deprived of quality equipment, and EU businesses, with a high cost in terms of jobs and economic activity in the EU.”

The commission has discussed its concerns with Chinese authorities. However, a satisfactory solution has not been proposed, and the EU had no other option than to tackle the issue through an IPI investigation, Gill wrote. The commission said it could not disclose the content of the draft IPI measure or next steps in the process.

Chinese manufacturers would be prohibited from bidding on public procurement contracts worth more than 5 million euros for five years.

In addition, no more than 50% of a contract’s value may be subcontracted to Chinese entities or include Chinese-origin medical devices, MedTech Europe said in a statement. The trade group said it would provide further updates once the IPI measures are published in the EU’s official journal.

The EU investigation into China’s medical device procurement practices was the first use of the IPI, which was introduced in 2022.

Getting fair access to Chinese markets became more challenging for medical device companies after the country launched a program calling for domestically produced medical equipment to achieve 50% market penetration in county-level hospitals by 2020 and 70% by 2025, according to a statement from the European Chamber, which represents European businesses in China.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/qRBdKL1KJdAg9JQ2rUc6PehdKwDm_BLX7UE_7nLAcw8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy02NTExMjAxMzZfMS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-06 19:04:50.054401

Lululemon, long viewed as one of retail’s most consistent performers, is stumbling. Shares of the Vancouver-based company fell as much as 23% after it reported weaker-than-expected guidance, margin pressure, and—most concerning to observers—a 2% comparable sales decline in the Americas.

That rare downturn, despite the launch of buzzworthy product lines like Align No Line, Daydrift trousers, Glow Up, and Be Calm, raised fresh doubts about whether the brand’s grip on premium athleisure lovers is starting to slip.

In a report titled “There’s less juice left to squeeze out of this lemon?” Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai is maintaining a “hold” rating. She wrote that the sales slowdown was troubling given “relatively easy comparisons” to the prior year and a heavy slate of newness. “It is unclear to us if Lululemon will be able to drive a material uptick in traffic and conversion through more innovation in the second half,” she added, noting that the U.S. may remain “a source of downside risk.”

UBS analyst Jay Sole voiced concern in a note cited by MarketWatch. “A pivotal question is if the slowdown in its U.S. business over the last 12-plus months has been temporary, driven by one-off factors, or a sign of something more fundamental,” he wrote. “Our main takeaway from first-quarter report is the likelihood that something more fundamental at play has increased.” He added that he sees little potential for meaningful U.S. growth.

Jefferies analyst Randal Konik was even more blunt, also in a note cited by MarketWatch: “Sell shares now.”

For the quarter, Lululemon’s revenue rose 7% to $2.4 billion. Comparable sales eked out a 1% gain globally. Income from operations increased 1% to $438.6 million, while profit margins narrowed. Its 2025 revenue forecast—between $11.15 billion and $11.3 billion—translates to 5% to 7% growth, below Wall Street’s expectations.

International sales are also slowing. Comparable sales in China rose 8%, down sharply from the 27% gain reported a year ago.

Lululemon pointed to plenty of positives, including rising U.S. brand awareness, now at 40%, up from the mid-30% range last quarter. It also said some new products sold out quickly.

Brian Nagel, an analyst who covers the company for Oppenheimer, takes a more optimistic view and continues to recommend the stock as likely to outperform competitors. “Management is prudently assuming a cautious stance toward nearer-term financial prospects as tariffs start to take hold,” he wrote. While Lululemon does plan moderate price increases, he believes its scale and balance sheet strength will allow it to “position better against brands with fewer strategic options and forced to take prices higher.”

But those brands—including Alo, Athleta, and Beyond Yoga—are gaining ground. Beyond Yoga, now owned by Levi Strauss, recently opened its first brick-and-mortar location on the East Coast and its largest store to date.

But marketers are starting to wonder: Is Lululemon still a category of one?",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/06/06/screenshot-2025-06-06-at-51141-pm_p47jLG0.png,N,,2025-06-06 19:04:44.846792

However, while Tesla sold nearly 1.8 million vehicles last year, Rivian managed around 50,000, barely enough to register as a rounding error on Tesla’s sales report. To have any shot at closing that canyon, Rivian needs to get its more affordable R2 and R3 models on the road quickly. But price isn’t the only hurdle.

A Demographic Rivian Can’t Ignore

According to a recent study by S&P Global, Rivian also needs to do a better job connecting with Asian-American buyers in the United States. Through the first quarter of this year, Asian households accounted for approximately 7.2 percent of total new car registrations, but for Tesla, this figure rises to a remarkable 27.2 percent . They also accounted for 12.7 percent of all EV sales, excluding Rivian and Tesla.

That’s a clear pattern. Asian-Americans are buying EVs in significant numbers, and a large share of them are choosing Tesla.

Read: Rivian’s Secret Stockpile Could Be Its Key To Defeating Tariffs

However, according to S&P Global, just 13.7 percent of Rivian’s sales go to Asian households. One possible explanation is that one of Rivian’s only two models currently on sale is a pickup truck. Data shows that Asian buyers account for just 2.3 percent of all full-size pickup sales in the U.S.

Even among those who are shopping for electric pickups, Rivian still comes up short. The Tesla Cybertruck, polarizing as it is, seems to be faring better with this demographic. About 24 percent of Cybertruck sales are to Asian buyers, compared to just 8 percent for the Rivian R1T. So it’s not just about the body style. Tesla’s appeal clearly extends deeper.

Can It Be Done?

Brand perception might be playing a major role here. Asian-American buyers seem to gravitate toward brands with a strong premium or tech-forward image. Just look at the numbers: 28.3 percent of Mercedes EQS SUV sales and 25.5 percent of BMW iX sales go to Asian households. Tesla is in that same league, with Asian buyers making up a full 33 percent of Model X sales.

For Rivian to break through, it’s not enough to be different or electric, as it needs to be desirable in the same way these established brands are. That means competing not just on specs, but on image.

The smaller R2 and R3 will also prove to be extremely important for Rivian’s expansion ambitions in the country, as they’ll appeal to a broader range of buyers. However, Rivian will need to be careful to ensure they remain well-equipped and feel premium, or else they may alienate one of their most important group of customers.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/news-media-chicago-space-6_fzuzbe-copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:06:41.578145

But Jeffries said part of the problem was where Nelisa Key asked for the water — in the pick-up area.","Kevin Key and his wife were heading to a comedy show in Richmond’s Short Pump Town Center on March 30 when Key, 38, started exhibiting frightening symptoms from his Stage 4 kidney failure.

“He just started sweating. He’s like, ‘I don’t feel well,’ ” his wife, Nelisa Key, told WWBT-TV in Richmond. “He started leaning over, and then he started vomiting.”

She had seen it before and knew her husband needed ice water. Nelsia Key noticed a Starbucks only a short distance away and took off running, her husband trailing behind.

“I was frantic. I think I was crying at that point,” Nelisa Key said. She explained to a long line of customers that her husband was having a medical emergency and needed water.

They were all sympathetic, said Nelisa Key, allowing her to cut to the front of the line. But that didn’t carry over to the barista, she said.

“I pointed back, because you could see Kevin, and I was like, ‘That’s my husband right there. He’s in Stage 4 kidney failure. I just need water fast for him,’ ” she recounted. “And the employee looked at me and was like, ‘You need to get in line.’ And then I repeated what I said, I’m like, ‘but my husband, he’s in kidney failure, we just need ice water quickly.’ And he looked at me again and was like, ‘You need to get in line.’”

At this point, Kevin Key was struggling.

“I could have possibly blacked out. It could have had a more dramatic impact on my body. My kidneys could have possibly just shut down,” he said. “A situation that should have taken, like, less than probably 10 seconds to get water, turned into a nightmare instantly.”

Nelisa Key knew time was short. She ran across the street in the outdoor mall to the Capital One Cafe, where she said an employee acted promptly to get her husband a cup of ice water.

“She was like, no problem at all. I hope he feels better,” she said. “And when I got to Kevin and gave him the water, he almost instantly felt better.”

Kevin Key recently got to meet the Capital One Cafe employee, named Emma, and thanked her for “being a caring human being.”

“Capital One Café stepped in, and they were able to help out in a situation when I needed help the most,” he said.

In a statement to WWBT, Starbucks spokesman Sam Jefferies said the company contacted the Keys to apologize, “and we hope to welcome them back to a store of their choice to give them the Starbucks experience they should expect.”

But Nelisa Key said the Seattle-based company refused to take accountability, offering the couple a gift card to try and make amends.

“Starbucks had a decision that day, like I said before, to pick policy or humanity, and they chose policy,” she said.

That policy, announced in January, reversed the store’s open-door policy. People who enter Starbucks are now required to order something from the menu if they want to hang out or use the bathroom, according to the new rules, posted online.

Jeffries said the company continues to train its employees on the new code of conduct, adding “we are working to ensure that everyone who visits our store has a great experience and training partners to communicate openly and from a place of kindness, compassion, and consideration for other patrons when determining how to proceed when a guest makes a request outside of our policies.

“If a customer communicates a request related to restroom access or water due to a medical, health or accessibility issue, we are committed to providing appropriate accommodations,” he continued.

But Jeffries said part of the problem was where Nelisa Key asked for the water — in the pick-up area. That disrupts the workflow, the spokesman said.

“We’re simply asking that water is handled like other orders — at the point of sale,” Jefferies said.",https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2029/06/starbucks-backlash.webp,N,,2025-06-06 19:04:59.689154

Dive Brief:

Grocery Outlet is facing a class action lawsuit alleging the discounter used a scheme of false savings and “fictitious” references to competitors’ prices to market and sell items in Oregon.

The lawsuit, which was filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court on Monday, claims the grocer violated Oregon laws and likely impacted more than 100,000 consumers statewide.

The case adds to Grocery Outlet’s legal woes and marks the latest lawsuit facing grocers over their pricing and sales strategies.

Dive Insight:

The lawsuit claims Grocery Outlet had an ongoing practice of displaying “fabricated” price comparisons without clearly identifying the source of the reference prices, the lawsuit alleges.

The case claims Grocery Outlet violated Oregon state law by marketing items to in-state consumers with the claim of an “elsewhere” price comparison with a competitor that is not within the same geographic area. Grocery Outlet “systematically advertised grocery items with inflated or fabricated reference prices—purportedly representing competitor pricing—without identifying the source of those comparisons, as required by Oregon law,” the complaint alleges.

“These deceptive practices created the illusion of significant savings, when in fact, consumers often paid the same or more than they would have at other local retailers,” according to the filing.

Grocery Outlet did not respond to a request for comment.

OCJ Law, P.C., which partnered with consumer organization Oregon Consumer Justice, brought the lawsuit against Grocery Outlet. The plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial.

The lawsuit comes at a time when people in Oregon are dealing with higher costs of living and higher food insecurity rates, Oregon Consumer Justice said in a press release.

“This lawsuit shows how those looking to more affordably provide for their families by shopping at Grocery Outlet, a supposedly ‘bargain market’, end up paying roughly the same amount or even slightly more than if they had shopped at another store,” the consumer rights group said.

Grocery Outlet is also grappling with a separate class action lawsuit filed earlier this year alleging the company committed securities fraud between Nov. 7, 2023, and May 7, 2024, hurting its investors.

The deceptive pricing lawsuit against Grocery Outlet is the latest case alleging pricing and sale misconduct by grocers. Last fall, Albertsons agreed to pay $3.9 million to settle a civil law enforcement complaint alleging the company unlawfully upcharged customers at its stores. Earlier this year, Publix got hit with a class action lawsuit alleging the grocer overcharged consumers for certain on-sale foods sold by weight, such as meats, cheeses and deli items.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xWt4DA6lDikPxd1-Woiz8mWUWwvW_311FaSBJuuFGd8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ncm9jZXJ5X291dGxldF9leHRlcmlvci5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-06-06 18:05:03.235741

""I can't emphasize enough how determined she has been in every meeting on taking care of workers,"" Bedard told a crowd of workers at the company's plant in Hamilton on Friday, alongside Joly and local politicians.

""It's unlike anything I've seen in my 38-year career. And the fact that she's here today wanting to understand what more she can do speaks volumes about how committed she is to our industry and our people.""

Before Friday, Bedard had rarely spoken publicly about ArcelorMittal Dofasco's efforts to get the federal government's help as Canada's trade war with the U.S. escalates.

Watch | Hamilton reels after Trump's latest steel tariff gut punch:

Joly's visit to Dofasco came a few days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order increasing tariffs of steel and aluminum from 25 to 50 per cent.

On Thursday, Canadian steel executives met with officials in Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal government, including Joly, to press for urgent assistance.

""It is clear that the government is seized with the gravity of the situation facing Canadian steel and understands the need for expediency in responding,"" Canadian Steel Producers Association CEO Catherine Cobden said about the meeting in Ottawa in a statement.

Dofasco plant a 'crown jewel'

While Joly toured the Hamilton plant Friday, Carney introduced new legislation to eliminate federal barriers to internal trade and enable more infrastructure projects to be approved faster.

These projects will include power lines and pipelines, and building up the defence industry, all of which will require steel that's made in Canada, Joly said. Much of that steel comes from Hamilton.

""This is a national asset, the crown jewel of the manufacturing sector,"" she said of Dofasco's plant. ""This is our opportunity to not only save jobs, but build jobs.""

The federal government is working on a plan to help companies financially in the short-term to prevent layoffs, Joly said. The government is also going to attempt to stop ""steel dumping,"" which is when foreign steelmakers sell steel into the Canadian market at ultra-low prices.

""We will have more to say very soon on those two issues,"" Joly told reporters. ""These can't be empty promises. We're in action mode.""

Mayor Andrea Horwath met with Joly Friday and said after that she urged the minister to ""get things moving quite quickly.""

'Hamiltonians are worried,"" Horwath said. ""This is impacting people and families."" She said in a statement earlier this week that the tariffs were putting ""thousands of good jobs at risk.""

Joly said diplomatic efforts with the Trump administration are ongoing and increasing Canada's retaliatory tariffs on American products is still an option.

The founding family has stepped up purchases of H&M shares, spending more than 63 billion kronor (US$6.6 billion) since 2016 to amass nearly two-thirds control and fuelling speculation it could take the Stockholm-based company back into private hands — despite denials from family members.

The Perssons, one of Sweden’s wealthiest families, have built up a growing stake through holding company Ramsbury Invest, saying little about their intentions other than that they “believe” in H&M, which was founded in 1947 by Erling Persson. The media-shy clan is now getting within striking distance of full control of the retailer, which in recent years has been losing ground among shoppers to its main rival Zara and “ultra-fast fashion” upstarts like Shein.

Article content

“This is something we’ve been talking about for years, and few would doubt that’s the direction things are headed,” said Sverre Linton, chief legal officer and spokesperson for the Swedish Shareholders’ Association, which represents small stock investors. If the family doesn’t plan to take H&M private, it should communicate that more clearly and stop buying shares, he added.

Article content

The family has ramped up insider buying by reinvesting dividends, boosting its H&M stake to almost 64 per cent from 35.5 per cent over the past nine years via Ramsbury, a vehicle named after billionaire Stefan Persson’s sprawling estate, one of the largest private landholdings in southern England. Including extended family holdings, the Perssons now control roughly 70 per cent of the capital and some 85 per cent of voting rights, according to H&M’s website.

Analysts including Niklas Ekman at DNB Carnegie say the regular purchases could be more than a show of confidence in the retailer. In a note to clients last month, he estimated that if the family keeps acquiring shares at the same pace a buyout could come as early as two years from now. If the family’s holding reached 90 per cent, it could request a de-listing of the shares.

Referent The Bernabéu continues to acquire projects that elevate the Real Madrid brand to another level.","Real Madrid has one of the most modern and coveted stadiums in the world. The new Bernabéu is at the forefront and has become a benchmark for the world's leading companies. Florentino Pérez, with this project, was looking for a functional stadium throughout the 365 days of the year, something he is achieving. After the opening of several top-level restaurants, the first Starbucks located inside a football stadium in Europe will soon arrive.

In fact, the American company is landing at the Bernabéu with a huge project, a project that will once again place Real Madrid on the map. It is expected that by the end of the summer Starbucks will open its first 'flagship' in Spain, which will be located in the new Bernabéu. It will be the largest Starbucks in Spain, with an area of ​​about 900 square meters, which will be divided into two floors, one for the store and the other for the cafeteria.

In addition, customers will be able to enjoy the space while enjoying views of the Bernabéu. We are talking about a Starbucks that will be unique in Spain and almost worldwide. The American company, with its arrival at the Bernabéu, will present a proposal similar to the one offered in the 'Starbucks Reserve Roasteries', of which there are only six in the world: Seattle, Shanghai, Milan, New York, Tokyo and Chicago.

Thus, Madrid, with the Bernabéu, will become part of this prestigious list. Spain, thanks to Real Madrid, will have one of the seven most exclusive Starbucks in the world. It is expected that the brand will sell products and offer experiences that can only be obtained at the Bernabéu and nowhere else in the world. That is the ambitious project that Real Madrid and Starbucks will present to society at the end of the summer, if the established deadlines are met.

""We were looking for an emblematic place to open it and the Bernabéu is the ideal place for it, because this will not be just another store of the brand. This 'flagship' is a tribute to the city of Madrid, to integrate the brand into Spanish and Madrid culture, since there will be many nods to the city, from drinks, materials, artists, in the end the objective of a 'flagship' is that it be a love letter to the city"", said Starbucks' 'brand manager', Catalina Carnicero.

ID7,Best Buy,2025-06-06 20:36:24+00:00,Home Health Care News,Hospital-at-Home Faces 'Wait And See' Moment Amid Waiver Uncertainty,Audrie Martin,,,,,https://homehealthcarenews.com/2025/06/hospital-at-home-faces-wait-and-see-moment-amid-waiver-uncertainty/,"While Best Buy Health is feeling the impact of uncertainty surrounding the HaH waiver program, health systems that have yet to launch HaH programs are hesitating amid questions about its long-term future.
Still, industry experts remain optimistic about HaH’s future, even as they acknowledge that the path to a permanent HaH policy is fraught with challenges.
“The movement is stronger than ever,” Dr. Robert Moskowitz, president and chief medical officer at Contessa Health, told Home Health Care News.
The company is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and collaborates with 11 health systems and various health plans, serving patients across nine states.
A “crowded policy landscape” is among the factors hampering the establishment of a permanent policy, according to Dorner.","Last week, Best Buy Health announced during an earnings call that it was restructuring its health division due to the slow adoption of at-home care. CEO Corie Barry specifically pointed to its hospital at home (HaH) program as an issue because of “inconsistencies” in the duration the Acute Hospital Care at Home program, currently set to expire in September.

While Best Buy Health is feeling the impact of uncertainty surrounding the HaH waiver program, health systems that have yet to launch HaH programs are hesitating amid questions about its long-term future. Still, industry experts remain optimistic about HaH’s future, even as they acknowledge that the path to a permanent HaH policy is fraught with challenges.

“The movement is stronger than ever,” Dr. Robert Moskowitz, president and chief medical officer at Contessa Health, told Home Health Care News. “Hospital capacity issues have not improved, and the viability of rural hospitals continues to be at risk. The factors that created the need for hospital-at-home programs continue to underscore the importance of the movement.”

Contessa Health has provided comprehensive in-home care since 2015. The company is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and collaborates with 11 health systems and various health plans, serving patients across nine states.

Hospitals have used the HaH model since the mid-2000s. In 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Acute Hospital Care at Home program, allowing hospitals to qualify for Medicare waivers to treat patients at home via telehealth. The waiver program has since been extended multiple times.

As of March 2025, 391 health care facilities across 39 states have been approved to provide HaH services, according to the American Hospital Association.

HaH is now entering a new phase, according to Dr. Michael Maniaci, enterprise medical director of virtual care at the Center for Digital Health at Mayo Clinic.

“While the initial pandemic-era surge in hospital-at-home enthusiasm has naturally leveled off, what we’re seeing now is a shift from broad experimentation to targeted refinement and scaling,” Maniaci told HHCN. “The movement hasn’t lost momentum; it’s entering a more disciplined and strategic phase.”

Major health systems, including the Mayo Clinic and Boston’s Mass General Brigham (MGB), have already integrated HaH into enterprise-level operational planning, aligning it with virtual care, command centers and decentralized delivery models.

“National conversations have matured,” Maniaci said. “We’re no longer asking ‘Can we do HaH?’ We’re asking, ‘How do we make it more efficient, sustainable and the new normal?”’

The Mayo Clinic Health System has dozens of locations in several states, including major campuses in Rochester, Minnesota, Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona, and Jacksonville, Florida.

An uncertain future

Hundreds of health systems have adopted the HaH model through CMS’ waiver program, but further adoption may be hampered by continued short-term extensions rather than a single, more permanent policy.

“One of the key issues with continued short-term extensions is that it is causing hospitals without home hospital care to delay their initial investment in launching their own program,” Dr. Stephen Dorner, chief clinical and innovation officer for Mass General Brigham Healthcare at Home said. “That is why we continue to advocate for a long-term extension to ensure that this high-quality, patient-centric care model continues to be adopted by more hospitals nationwide.”

The road to a long-term extension or permanent policy is not without its challenges.

A “crowded policy landscape” is among the factors hampering the establishment of a permanent policy, according to Dorner.

“There is currently a wide range of competing legislative priorities – from Medicaid considerations to tax reform – and it simply takes time for any new care model to find its footing,” he said. “But home hospital care has consistently shown up in every legislative package since the end of the public health emergency, with growing bipartisan backing.”

Another hurdle complicating the permanent implementation of the waiver is that HaH does not clearly fit into the current regulatory and reimbursement infrastructure.

“Hospital at home challenges traditional definitions of what it means to be hospitalized, and that disrupts deeply entrenched billing structures, site-of-care rules and legacy infrastructure,” Maniaci said. “CMS and policymakers are navigating the need for safety, equity and fraud prevention, while also grappling with the inertia of a hospital-centric payment model.”

Another issue is that HaH programs differ in intensity, staffing, technology use and outcomes, he said. This variability makes it difficult to create a one-size-fits-all permanent policy. Maniaci is in favor of a tiered, outcomes-based framework that allows flexibility while holding programs accountable to safety, quality and cost benchmarks is necessary.

A focus on outcomes drove the creation of the initial waiver and will be crucial in the development of a permanent policy, according to Caroline Rogers, vice president of quality and safety at Contessa Health.

“Data appropriately drive permanent policy decisions – both clinical and economical,” Rogers told HHCN. “A critical element of last year’s proposed five-year waiver extension, which had bipartisan and bicameral support, included the requirement for more robust data collection and analysis. This requirement will likely remain with the reintroduction of waiver extension legislation and is still the next logical step toward the development of a permanent policy.”

While data is a critical element of HaH, the technology necessary to collect and analyze data, such as remote patient monitoring, requires significant infrastructure and resources. A lack of federal support for the program could make it difficult for operators to invest in robust data systems, potentially resulting in reduced backing from commercial health plans.

Without this support, health systems will likely struggle to invest in HaH programs, slowing adoption.

Without an extension or the implementation of a permanent policy, the waiver will expire in September, requiring health systems to transfer patients back into their physical facilities immediately. This would strain hospital capacity, according to Rogers.

The clinical case is clear, and the operational model is functioning well, according to Dorner. The policy signals, – specifically inclusion in federal proposals, CMS engagement and cross-sector collaboration between health care and industry, – are all progressing positively.

“It’s not a question of if, but when,” he stated. “And when it happens, the systems that have done the hard work will be ready.”

On its end, MGB is not solely advocating for the preservation of the waiver, but also for creating “augmented capacity” by providing patient care in their homes, allowing brick-and-mortar hospitals to meet the needs of those patients who need them most, according to Dorner.

Adapting to uncertainty

Despite waiver uncertainty, “smart” organizations will continue to expand HaH programs, according to Maniaci.

To do so, health systems are diversifying their HaH offerings, Maniaci said. Strategies include forming payer partnerships outside of fee-for-service Medicare, piloting bundled or value-based contracts and investing in care models that are flexible between waiver and non-waiver states.

For example, the Mayo Clinic has intentionally created a modular system, called Advanced Care at Home, that scales across various geographies and operates within different regulatory frameworks. It is also incorporating HaH into bed capacity planning and facility expansion strategies, Maniaci said.

“Across the country, hospitals are refining their models, integrating more deeply with health systems and demonstrating with real situational data that home-based acute care provides safer, more patient-centered outcomes,” Dorner said. “In our case, we’re evolving from a start-up phase into a core service line. That kind of shift might appear quieter from the outside, but it signals a lasting transformation that we and many others across the country are undertaking.”

Still, Maniaci admitted that uncertainty leads to tough decisions and that health systems that were undecided about HaH are hesitating. Others are stalling on capital investment.

The lack of permanence is creating a “wait and see” environment that hinders innovation, Maniaci said. Despite that, the organizations that view HaH as part of a long-term shift toward decentralized, digitally enabled care are continuing to push forward.

“For those who have already committed to HaH as a core system focus, it is full steam ahead,” Moskowitz said. “But this also includes adapting or creating HaH models that can function outside of the CMS waiver. This can happen by contracting directly with payers. Alternatively, we see models that focus on hospital avoidance, early discharge, skilled nursing care at home, and palliative care at home – approaches that shift high-acuity care options safely and effectively to patients’ homes instead of inpatient care.”",https://homehealthcarenews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/congerdesign-from-Pixabay.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:04:27.871244

Federal law enables the tripling of antitrust damages, and that’s what U.S. District Judge James V. Selna did in his judgment yesterday. A federal jury in Selna’s court in Central California hit J&J’s Biosense Webster business with a $147 million verdict last month.

The jury found in favor of Scottsdale, Arizona–based Innovative Health on all of the questions over whether J&J had violated sections of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and California’s Cartwright Act through tying and other anticompetitive practices, allegedly maintaining a monopoly on cardiac mapping catheters and squeezing out reprocessors such as Innovative.

“This is a seismic result,” Daniel J. Vukelich, president and CEO of the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors (AMDR), said in a news release.

“The court not only affirmed what the jury found — that Johnson & Johnson illegally monopolized and tied the market to undermine reprocessed medical devices — but took the additional step of tripling the damages, as allowed under antitrust law. This sends an unmistakable message to all device manufacturers: anti-competitive, anti-reprocessing tactics won’t be tolerated by the courts or by hospitals committed to cost savings, sustainability, and patient care.”

MassDevice has reached out to J&J for a comment.

In its lawsuit, which goes back to 2019, Innovative Health accused J&J of illegally tying access to its Carto 3 cardiac mapping system specialists with the purchase of brand-new catheters for the system, enabling the medtech giant to maintain a monopoly on the cardiac mapping catheter market.

Innovative Health’s lawyers said in their complaint: “Biosense possesses enough economic power in Carto 3 clinical support (the tying product market) to coerce its customers into purchasing their high-density mapping catheters and ultrasound catheters (the tied products) from Biosense.”

The Ansley Mall location’s lease ends this month, and its official last day is June 8.
Former Ansley Mall Starbucks shift supervisor Amanda Rivera, who now works for Workers United on the Starbucks campaign, believes that the company is closing its Ansley Mall location in retaliation for union activity, which would be illegal.
The Ansley Mall location has been open for decades.
“The physical location, sure, it’s gone, but Starbucks Workers United Ansley Mall is something that they carry with them, and they can build at their new store.” Ansley Mall employees agreed, saying they feel hopeful about the future of the union.","The Ansley Mall Starbucks will close this weekend, just three years after unionizing. The location was the second to unionize in the Atlanta area in June 2022.

The Ansley Mall location’s lease ends this month, and its official last day is June 8. A Starbucks spokesperson told Atlanta Civic Circle that the company is collaborating with Workers United to transfer the location’s 12 employees to other stores.

“We deeply appreciate the opportunity we’ve had to build and share connections with the members of this community over the last several years,” Starbucks spokesperson Phil Gee wrote to ACC in an email.

Former Ansley Mall Starbucks shift supervisor Amanda Rivera, who now works for Workers United on the Starbucks campaign, believes that the company is closing its Ansley Mall location in retaliation for union activity, which would be illegal. Because Ansley Mall is a popular location close to the Beltline, she doesn’t see a reason to close the store there. ACC asked a Starbucks spokesperson why the company is choosing to close that location, but they did not directly respond to that question.

“This store has been a very strong and passionate union store,” Rivera said. “A lot of the workers that work in this store have been here since the beginning, for the past three years, and they care about each other, they care about the conditions they work under, and they care about the community.”

Ansley Mall baristas Shabeen Khetani and Elexis Bernavil agreed, with Khetani pointing to the store’s deep roots in the community. The Ansley Mall location has been open for decades.

Starbucks announced the store’s June closure in May. Both Khetani and Bernavil say that the short notice was disruptive to employees’ lives. Being transferred will also change their commutes, which Khetani said will add stress to employees who are dealing with financial difficulties. “A lot of my coworkers, specifically at my store, they have no reliable transportation, so they have to rely on public transit,” Khetani explained.

Workers at Ansley Mall unionized due to a variety of issues, employees said, including a lack of communication between the company and its workers about things like increased wages and safety. “Everything was kind of shrouded in mystery, and the company was making decisions without asking us what would help,” Rivera, the Workers United staffer, said.

Khetani, who worked for four years at Ansley Mall, said unionizing helped resolve some of the issues workers faced. “We were able to hold our previous managers accountable,” Khetani said. “And we were able to get our broken equipment fixed.”

SBWU workers have held several strikes and protests at Ansley Mall in the three years since unionization. Workers had concerns about management, communication from corporate, and Starbucks’s new dress code, which Rivera said was not negotiated with workers before the company introduced it. Khetani said complying with the dress code required her to buy new work clothes, which she could not immediately afford.

Bernavil transferred to Ansley Mall in January 2025 because she wanted to work at a unionized store. She described that location as a welcoming, inclusive place, especially for queer and neurodivergent people, and she’s sad to see it close.

Rivera believes the Ansley Mall employees will continue advocating for workers’ rights wherever they go, though. “The workers are all going to other stores, so their knowledge and their experience is not gone,” Rivera said. “The physical location, sure, it’s gone, but Starbucks Workers United Ansley Mall is something that they carry with them, and they can build at their new store.”

Ansley Mall employees agreed, saying they feel hopeful about the future of the union. Khetani will transfer to a location on Howell Mill Road and hopes to revitalize the union there, which she said has declined in strength since it started in 2022.

Currently, there are nine other unionized Starbucks locations in the Atlanta area. “The company doesn’t realize that when you send all these union members out to other stores that they are likely going to unionize those stores,” Khetani said. “If they shut down Ansley, two or three other stores in Atlanta are going to unionize.”",https://atlantaciviccircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250530_amanda_rivera0012-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:06:45.277682

CosMc’s, McDonald’s hopes, could change all that.
“CosMc’s needs to stand on its own and not be compared to McDonald’s as it’s a completely separate proposition.
Worrying signs for CosMc’s McDonald’s, if anything, is doing it worst.
McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski has now revealed that some of CosMc’s beverages will be added to the main Macca’s menu in the US.","And yet, on the outskirts of Chicago, there is exactly that: a Macca’s without a pattie in sight. No Quarter Pounders, no McChickens, not even a hint of a fry, French or otherwise.

This is CosMc’s: a bold experiment by McDonald’s to capture consumers who are less into Happy Meals and more into the sugary desserts masquerading as drinks that you might find at Starbucks.

Selflessly, here at news.com.au, we’ve tried some of this espresso slushies and neon cordials as well as the decidedly un-Macca’s like bites, so you know what they’re actually like.

And some of the food items in particular are so fast-food fab, after trying one you wouldn’t mind if you never ate a Big Mac again.

Not everyone is convinced though, with one Macca’s lover telling news.com.au they “drove off” when they saw it wasn’t the real deal.

“The premium beverage space has been growing, and McDonald’s wants to play in the arena,” a retail analyst told news.com.au.

But, he warned, success will be “hard to accomplish” and, so far, the signs for McDonald’s new chain are patchy at best. There are growing signs that CosMc’s could end up being a failed experiment.

CosMc's first outpost

On the side of a highway in Bolingbrook, Illinois, an hour west of Chicago deep in suburbia, is a very standard McDonald’s.

Its drive-through and kids playground wouldn’t look out of place on the side of any main road in Australia.

Next to it though is something notable. On the site of a former rotisserie chicken restaurant is a mutant Macca’s: CosMc’s.

The famous golden arches logo is there, but it’s subtle. The store is not painted red and yellow, but vibrant purple and yellow. It has a kind of 1950s Jetson’s space age quality about it.

The name is derived from “CosMc’s” a McDonald’s mascot from TV commercials in the late 1980s, a robot with eight arms and a weakness for stealing hamburgers.

It’s here that the burger king wants in on coffee. While Macca’s sells some basic beverages, people don’t make a beeline for McDonald’s when they want a sugary slushie espresso.

Indeed, Starbucks has around 16,000 outlets in the US outnumbering McDonald’s 13,500.

CosMc’s, McDonald’s hopes, could change all that.

“McDonald’s core business in the US is a mature and saturated business and that limits growth,” Neil Saunders, the managing director, retail, of US research from Global Data, told news.com.au.

“CosMc’s operates in a completely different segment – the popular and fast-growing beverage space – and McDonald’s wants to see if it can grab some share of that market”.

Drinks are very sweet, food is spicy

When the first CosMc’s opened, just over a year ago, McDonalds’s said the new sub-brand was “rooted in beverage exploration, with bold and unexpected flavour combinations, vibrant colours and functional boosts”.

What that manifests itself on the menu is an eclectic range of slightly bonkers drinks.

Perhaps an Iced French Toast Galaxy Latte? An Iced Turmeric Spiced Latte?

Too normal sounding for you? CosMc’s also offers the Sea Salted Caramelactic Shaken Espresso.

Dazzling in an orangey pink hue is the Island Pick-Me-Up Punch, consisting of “punched up” berry flavoured “powered” lemonade with dried strawberries? All “natural,” the description assures.

Then there’s Sprite Moonsplash and Pomegranate Hibiscus Slush.

News.com.au tried the bright purple Tropical Spiceade. Tropical is a vague flavour. In reality it was a not very spice berry cordial. Sweet was the overwhelming taste.

The Churro Cold Brew Frappe was a cold creamy – and very sweet – Frappuccino adjacent brew which doesn’t taste of churros so much but does have a hint of cinnamon

Many of the drinks simply seemed to exist to be colourful and sweet – there was little to differentiate them aside from the hue.

You’ll give up Big Macs for this

The food was more interesting. Apple cinnamon pops were little doughnut balls which were, no surprise, sweet, but they had nice tangy burst of viscous apple sauce.

The closet you’ll get to classic Macca’s fare is a creamy avocado tomatillo sandwich.

Tomatillos are a Mexican fruit used in salsas. And it turns a bite that could have a passing resemblance to a bland bacon and egg McMuffin into a spicy delight within a brioche bun.

It’s got a kick and I’d happily kick a Big Mac to the kerb for good if these were readily available.

Other choices are less successful. The pretzel bites are bland – warmed dough with chunky salt crystals. But, then, that’s pretzels for you. But a spicy, creamy queso dip livens it up.

‘I drove off’

But customers appear to be confused as to whether it’s a Macca’s or not.

“I thought it was McDonald’s,” one CosMc’s customer remarked.

“But then I saw the menu and drove off.”

This could be an issue, said Global Data’s Mr Saunders.

“CosMc’s needs to stand on its own and not be compared to McDonald’s as it’s a completely separate proposition.

“The market is saturated with choice, so CosMc’s will need to establish itself.

“It needs to become a part of people’s routines and that can be hard to accomplish.

“At the moment it is still seen as something of a novelty; it needs to move beyond that.”

Mr Saunders added that “constrained consumer finances” likely “will not be good for discretionary spending on expensive beverages”.

Just look at Starbucks. In the first three months of 2025, its sales fell 2 per cent in the US. It’s put in place a turnaround plan. Awkwardly for CosMc’s that has actually seen it axe the number of sweet, creamy drinks after customers who simply wanted, you know, a coffee complained they were awaiting while sugar caffeine cocktails were whipped up.

Worrying signs for CosMc’s

McDonald’s, if anything, is doing it worst. Its US sales fell 3.6 per cent during the same period as consumers slowed down their splurging – even on fast food.

In January, it said it would close three of its larger CosMc’s locations. There were only eight in total to begin with. Aside from the Illinois outpost, they are all now in Texas in and around Dallas and San Antonino.

The fast food firm said the smaller branches allowed it to “test new, unique circumstances that are reflective of our customer base”.

Just this month, CosMc’s said the CosMc’s Club loyalty program would shutter – hardly a sign that brand is thriving.

McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski has now revealed that some of CosMc’s beverages will be added to the main Macca’s menu in the US. The Sour Energy Burst and Sprite Moonshine could be sold alongside Fanta and Coke.

So is CosMc’s just a test bed of its big brother after all? A mini Macca’s of bonkers beverages and intriguing eats to see what customers really want?

Mr Saunders wasn’t so sure saying he saw “little mileage” in having a small, expensive, chain simply as a testing ground for new drinks.

“McDonald’s is still in the experimental phase of CosMc’s.

“Over the next few years, they will either scale it (up),” he said.

“Or they will drop it.”",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ac65fa666fc5a53fae008b7010220759,N,,2025-06-06 18:06:28.208267

In key changes, McDonald’s stopped setting targets for hiring diverse staff and suppliers. It also started using the word “inclusion” instead of “DEI.” But the company kept other programs, such as offering groups where workers with similar backgrounds can meet and sharing public reports on staff diversity.

Addressing Immigration Concerns

Beyond DEI, companies are also dealing with the Trump administration’s focus on immigration.

Some McDonald’s locations have been raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In response, McDonald’s is supporting its franchise owners, who run most of its 13,500 U.S. restaurants, in understanding employee rights during these situations.

McDonald’s has a special team from HR, legal, and government relations that meets every week to track changes in immigration rules.

MCD Sees Analyst Downgrade

Loop Capital Markets analyst Alton Stump has downgraded MCD stock and lowered the price target to $315 from $346, citing concerns over U.S. same-store sales growth.

The analyst had expected McDonald’s new menu items to boost domestic sales, but its recent chicken strips launch received mostly negative customer feedback. This could hurt the upcoming snack wrap launch, since it uses the same chicken strips.

Stump was optimistic about McDonald’s ability to drive sales through these product launches, but with weak early reception, it now believes the company may struggle to regain momentum in 2025.

Is McDonald’s a Buy, Sell, or Hold Stock?

Turning to Wall Street, MCD stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and 12 Holds assigned in the last three months. At $331.70, the average McDonald’s stock price target implies a 7.24% upside potential.

In multiple social media posts across X and Reddit, some consumers reported an issue in which it appeared a GameStop in New York had stapled receipts to their Switch 2 packages and punctured the console screens.

“GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box, FML,” wrote X user Oadhan Lynch, sharing a series of pictures of the product after it had been opened. “Genuinely insane now I’m gonna have to wait 3 months for the restock. And yes we were there for the midnight release so I bet everyone in this line is gonna have this same issue.”

GameStop is “investigating this as we speak and will make the customers whole,” a spokesperson for the retailer said in an email.

By Thursday afternoon, Lynch, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, shared an update on X that the store had “made things right” by sourcing “around NY and NJ to provide replacements to everyone who this happened to.”

Others who made similar claims on social media didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The consumer reports, which appear to be regionally isolated, come as gamers continue to rush to get their hands on the coveted Nintendo console, which was released Thursday.

The base device sells for $449.99, or gamers can shell out $499 for the console and the new Mario Kart World. Prices didn’t deter fans and gamers who waited in long lines at stores across the country. The original Switch was released eight years ago, and the hype for a new console has continued to grow in recent years.

But some vying to get the Switch 2 may have a longer wait than expected, with some shortages already being reported just hours after the console’s official release.

“We’ve been working really closely with our retail partners to ensure there’s ample supply for not only the launch weekend, but well beyond,” Nintendo President and COO Doug Bowser told CNBC at the midnight launch party for the product at Nintendo’s store in New York’s Rockefeller Center.

Others online said their Walmart orders were canceled just hours before they were due to be delivered. Some said Target was still “preparing to ship” their orders.

At the launch event, Bowser told CNBC that he encourages those who weren’t able to snag a Switch 2 during the preorder period to contact their local retailer, adding that the company is continuing to work with the stores “to replenish through that launch period and all the way into the holiday period.”

In its sales forecast last month, Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million units of the Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, CNBC reported.

Those who were lucky enough to get the product on Day 1 of its launch appear enthusiastic about the new updates, which include a larger, crisper screen and Joy-Cons (controllers) that snap into the side of the screen.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250605-nintendo-switch-ew-355p-6062f9.jpg",N,,2025-06-06 18:05:26.385569

Tom Geiger, special projects director for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, or UFCW, said the vote Thursday night mostly involves workers Albertsons and Kroger stores in Western Washington .
Geiger said both parties, the union and grocery stores, agreed to extend the terms of the former contract during negotiations.
Some “97% rejected the offer and voted to authorize the strike,” Geiger said.
While the negotiations are separate, Albertsons and Kroger workers in Colorado and California also voted to authorize a strike on Thursday night.","The union that represents about 56,000 mostly grocery and health workers across Washington, North Idaho and northeastern Oregon voted Thursday night to authorize a strike of employees working at grocery stores owned by Albertsons and Kroger.

However, the vote simply authorizes a strike and does not immediately call for one. And, it does not involve workers of Rosauers, Safeway, Albertsons and Fred Meyer in the Spokane area because they authorized a contract that does not expire until next year. Safeway is owned by Albertsons and Fred Meyer is owned by Kroger.

Tom Geiger, special projects director for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, or UFCW, said the vote Thursday night mostly involves workers Albertsons and Kroger stores in Western Washington .

“We authorized a strike to fight for better wages, better staffing, and a fully funded healthcare plan so that we can deliver the kind of service our customers deserve,” Vickie Logerstedt, a cashier at Redmond Ridge QFC, said in a news release. “We have been more than patient for months, but these companies have offered nothing but crumbs and mealy language. Time has run out.”

Efforts to reach the corporate offices of Albertsons, which is based in Boise, and Kroger, based in Cincinnati, were not immediately successful on Friday.

The strike-authorization vote follows two major events: The UFCW launched major opposition to the now failed merger attempt between Albertsons and Kroger, and ongoing contract negotiations for workers in Western Washington, Colorado and California, Geiger said.

A federal judge in Oregon and a Washington state judge ruled against the merger in December 2024, The proposal would have been the largest merger of grocery store giants.

Had the merger gone through, it would have led to the loss of Safeway stores on the South Hill and Spokane Valley, based on a previously released list of store sales.

The two grocery companies first announced in 2022 merger plans to get bigger to take on retail competitors Amazon and Walmart.

That proposed merger spawned lawsuits from the attorneys general of Washington and Colorado, and the Federal Trade Commission filed a federal suit in Oregon. All sought to block the deal over concerns that it would reduce customer choices and bargaining positions of employees across the country.

Then in January , the UFCW began negotiating new contracts for workers of stores in Western Washington for a contract that eventually expired in the first week of May.

Geiger said both parties, the union and grocery stores, agreed to extend the terms of the former contract during negotiations.

But talks stalled after the company’s offer, said Rich Smith, communications director for the UFCW.

“The wages were insulting, staffing is a core issue and right now they are underfunding the health care,” Smith said.

Based on that offer, the union put two questions to its membership, Geiger said. It asked workers whether they approve the offer, and, secondly, do you authorize a strike.

Some “97% rejected the offer and voted to authorize the strike,” Geiger said. “We feel it is a pretty clear message. Often, they have boiler-plate statements that say ‘We believe the best way to reach a good agreement is at the bargaining table.’ We agree.

“But, we’ve been at the bargaining table for five months telling the employers what is needed,” he continued, “and they haven’t been good listeners.”

Despite the vote to authorize a strike, the extension of the former contract calls for a 72-hour notice before the workers can begin a strike, Geiger said.

The parties are scheduled to resume talks on a potential new contract on June 12, 13.

“Hopefully, we’ll see something change up next week,” Geiger said.

While the negotiations are separate, Albertsons and Kroger workers in Colorado and California also voted to authorize a strike on Thursday night. All told, if all the UFCW workers do decide to walk out, it could affect up to 100,000 workers across the western U.S.

To support this, fleets require tires that deliver long miles to removal, perform in high-scrub environments, and can be retreaded in order to maximize their investment.”

Fuel economy is another key issue for commercial fleets. “We’ve seen an increased demand for fuel-efficient tires,” says Angela Crivoi, Senior Market Planning Manager at Yokohama Tire Canada. “It’s the number one demand we’re seeing from fleets.”

Jim Garrett, Product Category Manager at Michelin North America says he’s seeing a similar trend. “Michelin continues to see lowering rolling resistance to be a trend,” he explains. “As tires are being replaced, the new ones generally have lower rolling resistance. This is due to advances in technology, rubber compounds and general tire design. This comes from tire manufacturers, truck OEMs and fleets striving to reduce their environmental impact.”

Last-mile delivery & e-commerce

Yokohama’s Crivoi notes that she is also seeing a growing demand for tires for the last-mile delivery segment of the market, especially since e-commerce is so big nowadays. “And since emissions are also a growing concern,” she adds, “we’re also seeing a growth in the number of electrified delivery vans, and the tires they need.”

Riley Johnson, National Director of Commercial Segment for Groupe Touchette agrees. “With the increase in e-commerce, we’re seeing a lot more trucks and trailers hauling across the nation,” he explains. “For example, we’re looking at a big expansion at the port in Vancouver, which will triple the number of containers coming into the lower mainland, and all that cargo is going to be hauled by trucks and trailers.”

As for electrification, Riley brings out that we’re seeing electric trucks on the road today, which calls for commercial tires that can handle the extra weight and torque these trucks are known for.

Price pressures

Today’s fleets are also demanding more bang for their buck, explains James McIntyre, SVP Sales Canada / Product Development North America, Sailun Tire Americas. “We’re seeing several important shifts in the commercial tire space—not just in product trends, but in how fleets are approaching tire purchasing and management,” he says.

Tariffs are a big part of the problem, McIntyre adds. “With the recent tariffs on imported tires from key manufacturing countries, the potential for price increases is real. As a result, now more than ever, fleets are being forced to take a closer look at their operating costs, and tires are a major part of that equation,” he says.

McIntyre notes that there seems to be a shift in fleet behaviour. “They’re investing in products that deliver longer tread life, better fuel efficiency, and ultimately, lower total cost of ownership,” he explains. “With the advancements we’ve made in compound technology and tire design, we’re now able to offer commercial tires that not only last longer but also help improve fuel mileage—and all at a significant price savings. That’s proving to be a very attractive value proposition for fleet operators navigating uncertain economic conditions.”

Tariffs

One of the big issues facing the total cost of ownership calculation is tariffs. “Commercial tire prices in Canada will rise this year, in part due to ongoing tariffs,” says John Hagg, Vice President Sales and Operations at Huayi Tire Canada. “These trade-related costs are putting upward pressure on the supply chain, from manufacturing to distribution. Additionally, factors like raw material costs, transportation, and inflation are contributing to overall pricing increases across the industry.”

That said, Mike Matesic, Product Segment Manager, TBR at Dynamic Tire explains that tariffs aren’t impacting all commercial tire manufacturers equally. “The industry has already seen an increase in pricing on tires that are coming from the U.S. due to reciprocal tariffs,” he says, “but for products coming from country’s other than the U.S., it’s business as usual. The only concern may be the strength of the Canadian dollar since tires are traded globally in USD.”

Impact on commercial tire sales

Tire retailers may well wonder if all this uncertainty will translate into a drop in commercial tire business this year. According to Huayi Tire Canada’s Hagg, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. “Tariffs are expected to continue having a negative impact on the commercial tire market in Canada, particularly for long-haul, north-south trucking operations,” he says. “Until there is an updated agreement or revision to the USMCA, this segment may face ongoing challenges. However, demand for last-mile delivery tires remains strong, and is likely to continue growing—at least as long as consumer spending stays robust.”

Dynamic Tire’s Matesic agrees, and offers a bit of hope. “If your customers’ primary business focus is cross-border hauling of any items that have substantial tariffs on them, then the short and simple answer is yes, your business will be impacted,” he says. “That said, the trucking industry is always changing to suit the needs of the market. If trucks don’t go south due to tariffs, there will be product coming and going from the ports, east and west, to accommodate the market changes and deal with tariffs. The trucking industry will always adapt, change, and survive!”",https://autosphere.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Daimler-AG.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:04:55.351649

We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, HP's Chief Financial Officer.

Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be

available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.

As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings

materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligations, and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's SEC filings.

During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. In addition, unless otherwise noted, references to HP channel inventory refer to Tier 1 channel inventory, and market share references are based on calendar quarter information. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.

Thank you, Orit. And thank you to everyone for joining today's call.

Against the backdrop of a highly dynamic landscape, we delivered another quarter of solid top line growth, driven by continued momentum in the Personal Systems Commercial business. However, due to additional tariff costs that could not be fully mitigated in the quarter, our non-GAAP operating profit fell short of expectations. Today, we will take a deeper dive into Q2 performance, the evolving external environment, and our outlook. I will also highlight new innovations we introduced to drive our momentum forward.

Let me start with our Q2 result. Overall, we delivered revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter with a 5% increase in constant currency year-over-year. We saw strong growth in Personal Systems, particularly in Commercial and high-value category, driving momentum in our key growth areas. These meaningful results show that our Future of Work strategy is working.

Nonetheless, the rapidly changing external landscape, including shifting trade policies and additional tariffs, had a net impact of approximately 100 basis points on our non-GAAP operating profit, mainly in April and primarily impacting Personal Systems. This resulted in a roughly $0.12 impact on our non-GAAP earnings per share. By net impact, we are referring to all tariff-related impacts after taking into account the mitigation actions.

We swiftly responded to these changing market dynamic, and were able to partially offset them in the quarter through cost actions, pricing and accelerating the transition of our manufacturing footprint. We continued to diversify our manufacturing locations so that we can best respond to geopolitical changes with agility. We have expanded our manufacturing footprint for both PCs and printers to different locations, and we recently increased our production coming from Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mexico, and the US.

By the end of June, we now expect nearly all of our products sold in North America will be built outside of China, significantly accelerating our previous plan. However, it takes time and investment to fully mitigate such impacts.

Let me now share more color on our business unit performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, above our expectation, driven by strong Commercial performance. PC Commercial revenue grew 9% year-over-year, including strong growth in North America and Asia.

As expected, we saw continued strength in AI PC demand and the Windows 11 refresh, and we believe that momentum will carry forward.

We drove share gains year-over-year in Commercial PC, particularly in premium, workstations, AI PCs and gaming. We drove growth in services with several new wins in healthcare, financial services and retail.

Personal Systems operating margin came in below our guidance, largely due to higher tariffs that were not fully offset by our actions in the quarter. We expect to successfully mitigate these costs and return to our long-term target range of 5% to 7% next quarter.

In Print, revenue declined 3% in constant currency, in line with our expectation. We saw revenue growth across home and office in Europe, helping to offset a slowdown in North America and continued weak demand in China. And we continued to drive momentum in home with units up 2%, fueled by strong Big Tank growth. We grew share year-over-year in developed market, optimizing profitable share, mainly in office A4 value and A3.

In our key growth areas for Print, we saw continued growth in Consumer Subscriptions and Workforce Solutions, and we drove another quarter of growth in Industrial Graphics, supported by the portfolio launched at Drupa, confirming the high adoption of our new product introductions. Our focus remains on what we can control, executing with discipline, supporting our customers, and making strategic decisions that position HP for the long term.

Now, let's turn to the significant strides we made in innovation. This quarter, we advanced our strategy to lead the Future of Work by delivering experiences that help businesses grow and employees find greater professional fulfillment. At our Global AMPLIFY Conference in March, we deepened relationships with over 1,100 partners and customers. We unveiled more than 80 new products and services, and the positive reactions from attendees reaffirmed our direction.

A key highlight was the global rollout of the HP Workforce Experience Platform. Combining AI with real-time insights, this software solution enables CIOs to boost productivity and address issues before they disrupt work. Feedback from our early adopters has been incredibly positive, highlighting the platform's impact on workplace efficiency and its role in improving employee satisfaction.

To accelerate the adoption of AI and bring its benefits to the mainstream, we introduced one of the most comprehensive AI PC portfolios in the industry. This portfolio features the redesigned HP EliteBook and EliteDesk engineered to help people work smart and faster while keeping their data secure. To enhance advanced workflows for data scientists and AI developers, we teamed up with NVIDIA to launch the HP ZGX AI Station, our high-performance workstation powered by Blackwell, and designed to accelerate productivity and enhance security.

In Print, we are leading the way in security with our new LaserJet Enterprise devices, the first printers in the world designed to guard against quantum computer attacks. And our industrial print team received five prestigious European Digital Press Awards, recognizing our bold vision to lead the industry for automation, productivity and sustainability. In April, we brought our latest generation of latest technology to life, engineered to simplify production and optimize printing processes.

Third, with our Print Hub software, print shops can now drive greater efficiency and control from a single platform. This innovation played a pivotal role in our recent collaboration with Scuderia Ferrari, where we've co-engineered

a high-performance car product that's up to 14% lighter and 17% thinner, translating breakthrough technology into real-world speed.

The advancements across our entire portfolio this quarter demonstrate our leadership in creating a secure and powerful AI stack that connects devices, data and workflows to drive meaningful productivity.

In Q2, we acted quickly to address tariff-related headwinds, taking decisive steps like accelerating our manufacturing rebalancing, redesigning our logistics network, shifting sourcing, and qualifying new product configuration. These efforts both strengthened our operational agility and led the foundation for continued resilience. We will carry this momentum into Q3 and Q4 as we further reinforce our supply chain and operational capabilities. Additionally, we have implemented price increases to help offset cost pressure. While these decisions are never taken lightly, they are essential to maintaining our financial discipline.

Looking ahead, the remainder of fiscal 2025 will be shaped by a range of factors, some of which remain uncertain. We have planned for today's tariff landscape. And if it changes, we will respond swiftly as we did in Q2. We continue to expect that PC market will grow in 2025, but softer than originally planned, driven by increased macro uncertainty. That said, we remain confident in our ability to grow faster than the market and gain share. In Print, we continue to expect the market to decline low-single digit for calendar year 2025.

We expect the actions we are taking to gain full traction in the second half, leading to sequential operating profit improvement. We are making progress with the execution of the Future Ready Accelerated Plan that we announced last quarter, and we are now expecting to exceed our goal and deliver at least $2 billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by the end of fiscal year 2025. These incremental structural savings will help mitigate macro and geopolitical uncertainties while continuing to support investments in strategic areas.

We are confident in our ability to navigate an evolving market. We have always excelled in managing complex environment. We have an incredible team capable of optimizing processes, implementing best practices, and achieving global efficiency. As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering sustainable growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. Our focus on harnessing the power of AI to make work more personal, productive and fulfilling will drive our success now and into the future.

Let me now hand it over to Karen.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone.

We delivered another quarter of solid top line growth, driven by continued momentum in the Personal Systems commercial business, aligned with our vision of leading the Future of Work. We executed our strategy across multiple fronts, including growing share in high-value categories across Personal Systems and Print, driving momentum in our key growth areas, and exercising disciplined cost management while continuing to invest in strategic initiatives.

However, against the backdrop of a dynamic geopolitical landscape, our non-GAAP operating profit fell short of expectations due to additional tariff costs that could not be fully mitigated in the quarter. As a reminder, our guidance for Q2 included tariffs in place at the time. While we plan for a range of scenarios in the quarter and we worked aggressively to respond to changes in the regulatory trade environment, the tariff increases announced in

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 28-May-2025

April were higher than expected. That said, as you heard from Enrique, we made meaningful progress expanding our supply chain and manufacturing footprint, and we accelerated actions on cost reduction and pricing.

However, as we indicated last quarter, the full benefit of these mitigating actions can take a few months' lead time depending on the scope. During the quarter, our operating margin was impacted by net tariff costs, mainly in Personal Systems.

Taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 3% nominally and 5% in constant currency, with growth across all regions. In constant currency, APJ grew 9%, Americas grew 5% and EMEA grew 1%. And while we made progress on the cost of good reduction actions we started at the beginning of the year, gross margin at 20.7% was down year-over-year, with increased tariff and commodity costs. We drove non-GAAP operating expenses down year-over-year to help offset, including driving Future Ready cost savings, continuing disciplined cost management, and reducing variable compensation. All in, our operating margin of 7.3% was impacted by roughly 100 basis points due to unmitigated tariff and related impacts, mainly in Personal Systems. Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was flat year-over-year, in line with our expectations, with lower short-term borrowing costs offset by currency losses.

Finally, with the diluted share count of approximately 956 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.71, reflecting the tariff and related impacts net of mitigations of approximately $0.12.

Now, let's turn to segment performance. We delivered another quarter of solid growth in Personal Systems with revenue up 7% nominally and 8% in constant currency, above our expectations, and driven by higher Commercial volumes and increased ASPs. We did see some demand pull forward, but estimate it was minimal, accounting for less than 1% of our revenue growth. As we signaled, we drove disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate increased tariff and component costs, and shifted mix toward premium categories. And momentum continued in our key growth areas, with strong performance in AI PCs, Advanced Compute and Workforce Solutions.

We also drove Commercial unit growth of 11%, gaining share overall and in premium categories as the market momentum and refresh activity continued. Commercial revenue increased 9% year-over-year with pricing actions and mix shift toward premium offset in part by currency impacts.

In Consumer, our results reflect our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to a more profitable mix. We saw 2% revenue growth on lower volume through favorable pricing and mix shift, including share gains in gaming.

Our operating margin in Personal Systems was 4.5%, below the range we guided at the beginning of the quarter and down year-over-year from higher commodity costs and tariff costs that were not yet fully offset by repricing and cost reductions. It's worth noting that excluding the impact of tariff costs, our PS margin would have been well within our 5% to 7% guidance range.

Turning to Print. Our results were in line with expectation as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement. We increased our market share in high-value categories, and drove overall hardware unit growth. Our key growth areas continue to gain momentum, including revenue and subscriber growth in Consumer Subscriptions and industrial growth fueled by both hardware and supplies.

Across Print, revenue declined 3% in constant currency on supplies declines and hardware softness in North America. By customer segment, we grew Consumer units 3% year-over-year, led by strong growth in Big Tank. In Commercial, revenue declined 3% year-over-year on a 2% unit decline. We continued our purposeful focus on profitable long-term unit growth, gaining share in the higher-value categories of A4 and A3. Supplies performed as

expected, down 3% in constant currency, and we drove favorable pricing and market share gains that were more than offset by installed base and usage headwinds. Yet we delivered strong Print operating margin, up year-over-year and above the high end of our range, reflecting rigorous cost discipline and pricing actions, as well as the favorable impact of grant funding received in the quarter. We continue to execute our accelerated Future Ready Plan across process efficiency, automation, portfolio optimization and operational excellence.

And as Enrique mentioned, we now expect to achieve cumulative gross run rate savings of at least $2 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025, with no change to our estimated restructuring charges of $1.2 billion for the program. These incremental structural savings continue to be a key lever to help offset macro and geopolitical uncertainties while also continuing to fuel investment in our key growth areas and AI innovation, all designed to position us well for long-term sustainable growth.

Now, let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Our cash flow from operations was roughly $38 million in the quarter. And as expected, free cash flow was slightly negative due to the timing of payments for intentional inventory actions we took in the prior quarter as part of our overall tariff mitigation. Those payments resulted in a decrease in DPO and corresponding increase in our cash conversion cycle in Q2, also as expected.

Lastly, we returned close to $400 million to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. A planned debt refinancing ahead of an upcoming maturity contributed to us finishing the quarter slightly above our target leverage range. So, in line with our stated policy, with a temporary increase in leverage, we limited our repurchase to offsetting stock compensation dilution.

As we look ahead, we will continue to navigate a dynamic environment that may be impacted by a continuing

evolution in global trade policy, broader macroeconomic trends and the associated impact on customer demand. For that reason, we believe it is prudent to moderate our guidance for the second half of the year to reflect this.

In our guide, we have accounted for the added costs driven by the current tariffs in place and associated mitigations, including leveraging our supply chain flexibility, Future Ready cost reductions and pricing action. We were able to mitigate part of these costs in Q2, and we are confident that we will fully mitigate them by Q4.

In Personal Systems, while we expect to continue to gain share, we now expect the PC market to grow low single digits for both the second half and full calendar year, given the uncertain macro environment. We still anticipate commercial PC catalysts, including the Win 11 refresh and AI PC adoptions to drive solid revenue growth in the back half of the year. And we expect the actions we are taking to offset the cost of tariffs to gain full traction in the second half, leading to sequential improvement in Personal Systems margins in both Q3 and Q4.

In Print, we continue to expect the market to decline low single digits for the calendar year, with the second half of the year declining closer to mid-single digits, in line with industry experts. We also expect our operating margin to continue to be near the top of our 16% to 19% long-term range for the year.

Beyond the segments, we expect Corporate Other to be slightly higher, approaching $1.1 billion, as we integrate the operations of our Humane asset acquisition into our technology and innovation organization.

With this all in, we now expect FY 2025 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3 to

$3.30 and FY 2025 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.62.

Turning to Q3. In Personal Systems, we expect revenue to grow high single digits sequentially as we continue to see strength in Commercial aligned with our Future of Work efforts and pricing actions. And we expect Personal

Systems margins in the lower half of the 5% to 7% range, improving sequentially as a result of the mitigation efforts we are driving.

In Print, we expect Q3 revenue growth to perform better than typical seasonality on incremental hardware placements and pricing actions. We expect operating margins solidly within our 16% to 19% range as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement, tariff mitigation and disciplined cost management.

With all of this, we expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.80 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.69.

In line with our revised earnings, particularly in Personal Systems, where we have a negative cash conversion cycle, we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $3 billion for FY 2025. With regard to working capital, we expect our cash conversion cycle to also be impacted by the timing of purposeful actions we are taking to mitigate the fluidity of the tariff situation.

It is important to note, however, that we not only expect the impact of these actions on working capital to be temporary, but as mentioned earlier, we also expect to fully mitigate the current cost of tariffs by Q4. And on our balance sheet and capital allocation, given the impact of tariffs, we expect our leverage ratio to continue to be above our target range in Q3. That said, we remain fully committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2 times, and we do not see more attractive investment opportunities.

In closing, we responded quickly to the changing market dynamics in the quarter to address headwinds from a rapidly changing trade environment. We remain focused on what we can control and are confident that the actions we are taking are the right ones to position us for long-term profitable growth.

With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Thank you so much for taking my questions. Enrique, maybe just to start. Can you maybe add a little bit more context around your expectations for the PC market in the second half of the year? What is causing the guide down? Is it large enterprises weaker? Is it small enterprise weaker

excuse me, SMB that's weaker? International markets weaker? You've talked about raising prices. So, I just love a little bit of context a little more context on kind of PCs in the second half of the year, including any channel inventory comments.

And then big picture, does this really mean that kind of Windows 11 refresher is really not a catalyst that we need to think about if we're growing low-single digits during the refresh period? Just a little bit more context would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Sure. Thank you, Erik. So, let me try to answer all the questions you have in your question. First of all, in Q2 and in the first half, we have seen strong demand on the PC side, especially in Commercial, as reflected in our results. When we think about the second half, though, we thought it was important to be more prudent in the estimation that we have for the market, given a few of the trends that we see.

First of all, we are, today, in a very different economic situation from where we were a few months ago in terms of both consumer and business confidence. Second, we have seen announcements across the industry for price increases in the second half, and we think the combination of both will potentially have an impact in the demand that we see.

We are not integrating any effect from channel inventory. All of them are under control or under good

in a healthy position. We think that the impact will be both for Consumer and Commercial. And again, it's more a matter of prudency as we look at the second half more than we saw any trends in Q2 that we thought were going to be impacting the overall market size in the second half. Our plan and our goal is to grow share in that market. And of course, if the market is bigger than what we are expecting today, this should be reflected in our results.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

And I would just add, Erik, that Win 11 does remain a catalyst for the back half. And if demand comes in stronger than our moderated guide, that will be reflected in our results.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Okay. Great. I appreciate all that color, guys. Thank you so much for that. And then maybe a follow-up. Enrique, I would just love if you could give a little bit more kind of high-level color for your growth businesses. I think it would help us all better understand kind of two key metrics there. First, just when you add up all of the growth

businesses that you alluded to in your presentation, how big are they? What percentage of revenue are Personal Systems or Print? Any color that you could share on the size there? And then how fast are they growing? I appreciate the commentary on sequential growth, but I assume many of these businesses have different seasonality. So, just how big are these businesses? How fast are they growing year-over-year? And how should we think about growth of these businesses, say, over the next one to three years? Would just love to get better context on that. Thanks so much.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Thank you, Erik. So, we haven't disclosed the overall size of the businesses. Let me tell you, the two key metrics we have shared before that continue to be true is they are growing faster than the core businesses, and the gross margin is also higher than the gross margin of the core businesses. So, these two key factors continue to be true. Within growth businesses, we include businesses like AI PCs where we have seen very solid growth, not only quarter-on-quarter, but year-on-year. We said that our goal is for AI PCs to represent more than 25% of the PC business by the end of year, and we are on track to meet that goal. Within growth businesses, we have also our Workforce Solutions business on services and consumer services. Both of them have very solid growth in the quarter. Within the growth businesses, we have workstations that had a very solid growth performance during the quarter, industrial print. So, overall, they performed well, they performed as we were expecting, and they're a significant part of why we continue to see the second half stronger than the first half because they will continue to drive growth for the company.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Got it. Thanks so much.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Thank you, Erik.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have just two, both in Personal Systems. First, just on Personal Systems margins, it's encouraging to hear that you'll return to the long-term range next quarter. I was just wondering if you're assuming that you'll be in that 5% to 7% range for the full year as well? And what are some of the key swing factors that you're watching for? And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could comment on whether you saw any Personal Systems demand pull-in in this past quarter ahead of any prospective tariffs and the current outlook there. Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question. In terms of PS margins, yes, we do expect our margins to be in the 5% to 7% range for the full year. Given the impact in Q2 for the full year, it's likely to be in the lower half of that range, but with good sequential improvement. And...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

And in terms of pull-in, we saw some pull-in in the PC space into Q2. But at the overall level, fairly small. Our

estimation, having look at achievement data, sell-out data, is that less than 1 point of growth was driven by pull-in. So, it's a relatively small number overall. Of course, if we look at North America sales, it would be bigger because it will represent a bigger percentage. But again, overall, at the company level, was less than 1%. And this is the case for PCs. We didn't see any pull-in for Print.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Thank you, Enrique. Thank you, Karen.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Great. Thank you very much. A couple ones. One, on just AI PCs. I know you're still pretty bullish on AI PCs. But if you can just help us understand what are some of the killer applications that you hear from your end customers on this mix shift towards AI PCs? And then within your expectations for PS Systems growth, how should we think about the impact of pricing and mix shift towards these AI PCs within your overall growth expectations for that segment? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Thank you. So, overall, as I said before, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in AI PCs. Our goal is that they will be more than 25% of the mix of PCs by the end of the year, and this continues to be the case.

In terms of key applications, what we have seen is a large number of software companies introducing solutions that utilize the capabilities of AI PCs. We had more than 100 ISVs supporting that now, and this number is only growing. And this is why we think that the penetration is going to continue to grow because if you are in the Commercial space and you buy a PC today, you want to be able to take advantage of those capabilities as software will be available. That's the key message we make to customers. And as you can see from the progress we are making is resonating.

In terms of the impact it will have, you 're correct, it will have an impact on average selling price. The goal that we have shared before is that they will represent around 50% of the total shipments of PCs three years after introduction, so about two years from now. We are on track to make that number. And at the average, they are between 10% and 20% higher price than regular PCs. But this, of course, will have an impact on the total value. Something relevant to highlight this quarter is that we introduced AI PCs for the mainstream. This was one of the major innovation announcements we made in Q2 that is going to continue to help to drive adoption and to drive growth in this category.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Okay. And then if I may

thank you for that. If I may on just free cash flow. I understand PCs are a negative cash conversion cycle and hence affecting. But just if you can help us understand the free cash flow margins ticking down a little bit this in terms of your guide, that would help a lot. And what are the drivers for that? Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yeah. No, thanks for the question. Our free cash flow guide that we revised does follow earnings. And so, in line with that earnings guide, we did reduce our free cash flow expectations for the year, but it's mainly driven by the reduction that we saw in earnings, which is really driven by the operating margin impact that we had this quarter. That, along with lower-than-expected working capital improvement, is what caused us to guide down. We still do expect working capital improvement, but just a little lower than we had anticipated given the fact that we're focused on doing everything we can to offset these trade-related costs. I would say it's important to note, though, that these working capital moves are temporary and they are purposeful actions really as we mitigate the fluidity of the situation.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Let me maybe provide some color on the working capital side. As we have said in the prepared remarks, we have diversified our supply chain, we have built factories in different places. And to operate those factories now, we need more working capital than we did in the past. Over time, we will optimize and we will make them more efficient. And this is what Karen was saying, this will be temporary, but we see a needed increase now as the supply chain has become more diverse.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Yeah. Thank you. I was wondering if you could share a little more color on some of the mitigation impacts that you're putting in place. How much of this tariff impact you expect to offset from pricing? So, maybe some thoughts around what those price increases could look like and which areas of the market would you be targeting versus cost actions versus potentially moving supply chain? Any quantification there would be helpful. And I have a follow-up.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Let me provide more color on that, and maybe Karen also wants to complement. So, we have taken a lot of actions during the quarter to mitigate the change of the trade environment. Let me start by, we accelerated the shift of factories out from China into Southeast Asia, into Mexico, to a certain extent in the US, to mitigate the impact of the change.

A quarter ago, we shared that our goal was to have less than 10% of the products in North America being shipped from China by September. We have accelerated that, and we shared that now almost no products will be coming from China sold in the US by June. This is a very significant acceleration of the plan that we have.

We have also changed our logistics network. And for example, we have removed the US as a distribution hub for products that will be going to Canada or to Latin America, which I will avoid them having

we will avoid us having to pay tariffs. We have also taken additional cost actions, as Karen mentioned in the call. And also in a very targeted way, we have also taken price actions across the full portfolio, both in Personal Systems and Print to reflect the cost that we have seen. This, we have seen the market and the rest of competitors taking similar actions across the two industries. So, we see this as an industry change that will be being put in place at the end of Q2 and now in Q3.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

And I would just add that we're not going to quantify what comes from price versus supply chain moves versus other cost actions. But on our Future Ready program, we did talk about driving an additional $100 million more in savings. And those are really

we targeted higher goals for many of the savings opportunities that we're already working on. That included the consolidation of some of our teams under our new TIO organization, also driving more simplified management layers and locations, and reduction in IT applications throughout. And as a result, these actions are now yielding more upside than we initially anticipated and will be realized sooner than planned. And then lastly, I would just note, as we said before, that by the time we exit this year in Q4, we expect to fully mitigate the cost of these current tariffs.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Okay. Thanks for that color. And as my follow-up, you are actively moving the supply chain away from China, but you also noted like areas like Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, Philippines. What gives you confidence that your moves, given sort of we still don't know where reciprocal tariffs might end up, that these moves are going to be optimal. What are some of the things that you're thinking through? And how quickly would you be able to shift production between these areas as you think about what might happen potentially with reciprocal tariffs? Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yeah. I think you're right. We are in a fairly fluid environment, so I think I don't want to speculate on what could happen and what changes we will do. I think what you have seen is we have reacted very fast to the changes that we saw in April. We have been able to rebalance supply chain and accelerate some of the plans that we have.

We will be fully compensating for that in about two quarters by Q4, as Karen just said. And we will respond in a similar way to whatever changes happen going forward. We will look for the opportunities, we will optimize the supply chain, and we will respond swiftly to those changes.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Thank you very much.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Question. And maybe if I can start off with the Print margins in the quarter, again very solid margins. Maybe if you can just help us with sort of the driver of the margin out performance you had there? How much of that is maybe some business drivers versus the Future Ready cost actions that you're taking? And particularly in relative to the guidance you have for 3Q, you talked about above seasonal revenue growth as well, but moderating the margin expectations. So, is there a certain one-off driver there that we should think of or is that more just in terms of business mix to sort of really play out in the quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thank

y..o...u.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yeah. Thanks, Samik, for the question. So, on our Print margins, we were pleased with the fact that they were

it continued to be high and above the high end of our range, and that reflects rigorous cost discipline as well as the pricing actions we were taking to offset the trade-related costs. And we mentioned the favorable impact of a grant funding received in the quarter. It was a multi-year grant from the Economic Development Board of Singapore, and that was in support of activities that we've had there for over 20 years. I would just say it's a long-term grant, and it was signed in Q2, but it was retroactive to the beginning of the calendar year. So, the amount booked in Q2 was a little higher than the quarterly rate that we will see going forward.

And in terms of our confidence in Print margins going forward, we do expect margins to be solidly within our 16% to 19% range in Q3, and that's really because we expect to drive some incremental hardware placements. But then we also expect sequential improvement in Q4 with a higher supplies mix that we typically have in that quarter, along with the full benefit of the traction that we're making on trade-related actions and Future Ready cost savings. So, hopefully, that helps.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Yeah. No, thank you for that. And the second question is just a clarification on the PS margins and the sequential improvement to expect in Q3 and Q4. From your prepared remarks, Q3 does have a part quarter benefit from the supply chain changes that you're making. But as we look from Q3 to Q4, is it really the improvement, the realization of a full quarter benefit of the supply chain changes or is there incremental benefit from pricing as we move from Q3 to Q4 as well? Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yeah. So, we are expecting strong improvement in Q4, and I'll start with the fact that Q4 is typically our strongest quarter for both Print and PS. And this year, we do expect continued momentum in the PC market, driven by Commercial. We also see Q4 as typically our highest season with an increase in consumer demand tied to back-to-school and the holiday purchases. And we have many new products for customers to choose from.

And then also, we talked about the cost side. We've implemented these moves in the manufacturing supply chain that are going to take broader traction as we proceed through the year. And then we're on track to achieve the additional $100 million to achieve the $2 billion in broader cost savings as we exit our Future Ready program at the end of the year. And of course, pricing will play a role too. Altogether, we expect our PS margins to be in the lower half of the 5% to 7% range in Q3 and improve sequentially. So, hopefully, that helps.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Yeah.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

And I think it's probably important to highlight that based on the guide that we are providing that we have high confidence for, we will be exiting Q4 with both the company with revenue growth at the company level and with both businesses within the long-term ranges that we have shared before, which is a sign of confidence for the future.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. I guess maybe just to start off with Enrique, what you were talking about the end right now. You're sort of embedding a very sizable step-up in earnings in your fiscal Q4. I think the implication is you'll do $1 for earnings power in Q4. Can you just touch on how much of that ramp-up from, call it, the $0.70 run rate you have right now to $1, how much of that is revenue driven versus driven by all the cost reduction initiatives that you have in place? Would be good to understand just how much of this is controllable versus not perhaps.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Thank you. It's a combination of both. In Q4, as Karen just said, we expect to see a strengthening of demand compared to Q3. And if you look at normal seasonality, this is what happens, for example, in the Consumer space, driven by both back-to-school and the holiday season. Q4 is a very strong quarter. And in the Commercial side, we continue to expect to see the demand that we have seen in the previous quarters, driven by Windows 11, driven by the refresh of the installed base, and driven by AI. All this will have an impact on the demand side.

And then on the margin side, on the cost side, both the pricing actions that we are taking, but also all the work on costs, both redesigning supply chain, the impact of Future Ready will have an impact in the margins on Q4 sequentially, and this is what gives us confidence that we'll be able to achieve these numbers.

As I said at the beginning, we have moderated our growth expectations for PS especially, but we continue to expect that the PS business will grow in the second half compared to where it was a year ago.

Karen?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

I would just reiterate that much of our confidence is because of the actions that we're taking today that we know just take time and will gain full traction in Q4.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Fair enough, and that's helpful to just kind of understand those dynamics. You've also talked about a couple of issues that are impacting your fiscal 2025 EPS guide, right? It's about 40% impact right now. At a very high level, is there a way to think about how much of the 40% impact is from just the direct trade tariff-related issues that you have versus demand potentially moderating? Is there a way to think about those two buckets and how big of an impact each one is causing?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yeah. I would think about it this way, that the impact that we had in this quarter of 100 basis points on our margin and $0.12 of EPS was due to the tariff-related impact that we weren't able to fully mitigate. And as we look ahead in the back half, the reduction in our guide is mainly driven by us choosing to prudently moderate our growth expectations given the macroeconomic environment.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Great. Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

But in an indirect way, also the change of expectations is related to the new trade environment and to the new trade situation, not directly on cost, but just on demand.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Fair enough. Thanks.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And your next question is from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

....moving the manufacturing to avoid the near-term tariffs, and you've noted that you expect higher working capital. But my question is, what are the longer-term impacts from these changes, particularly to your expense structure and margin for the new configuration versus the prior configuration in fiscal 2026 and beyond?

Thanks.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Hello. As we said before, we expect to finish the year within the range that we had provided before. And at this point, this continues to be the expectation for the year 2026 and beyond. We think that we can compensate the cost impact on tariffs. It takes us this time a couple of quarters, and this continues to be the assumption that we have going forward.

Q

Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Maybe just on the first one on PC, one on Print. On the PC side, can you just talk a little bit about kind of price elasticity and what you've seen in prior cycles? It sounds like there might be some upward ASP pressure due to tariffs and everything else. If you could just talk about what you've seen traditionally in this time, do you think because of AI PC and enterprise and maybe an aged base, it's not as much of an issue?

And then second, on the Print-related businesses, could you just talk about competitive landscape and any kind of Yen movement that might have impacted or might be impacting competition either way there? Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Yes. I think in terms of elasticity, it's hard to compare the situation to previous situations given what is driving that. We have built some of that into our estimation for the second half and the more conservative plan or estimation for the market that we have put in place. And I think this is the best way to reflect kind of the changes and elasticity that we see.

In terms of Print, what we have seen quarter-on-quarter is that pricing has been more stable, so we haven't seen an improved repricing environment, but it has stayed stable versus what it was a quarter ago. And during the last weeks, most of the Print competitors announced price increases related to the changes in the trade environment. So, this will be reflected in the overall pricing environment in the market in Q3 and in Q4.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And our final question comes from the line of Alek Valero with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. This is Alek, on for Ananda. So, my question, I actually have one more on PC pull-in. So, I know you mentioned you saw a very small impact during the quarter, but I wanted to see if there's any impact to second half of the year.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Again, the impact was so small that, again, the company level has a very minimum impact. If we look at the US, it had more just because of mathematics of dividing the pull-in versus a smaller market. And we have reflected on that in the guide that we have for the second half and in the estimation that we have for the market.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call

Q

Got it. Thank you for that. Just a quick follow-up. Also on PCs, are you seeing customers buy richer PC configurations yet, specifically for the purpose of GenAI?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Well, we have seen significant growth of the AI PC category and the mix continued to improve, of course, year-on-year, but especially quarter-on-quarter, which is more relevant at this stage. So, clearly, they are having

customers are valuing the new functionality, the new performance of these products, and this is driving the improvement in mix.

Q

Got it. Thank you.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Thank you. So, I think that we are approaching the end of the call. So, again, thank you, everybody, for participating and joining the call today.

I would like to close the call confirming our confidence in three areas. First, the confidence in our Future of Work strategy to continue to drive growth. Second, the confidence in the team on how to respond and how to navigate any type of environment, responding quickly and decisively. And finally, our confidence in our ability to continue to create shareholder value.

Thank you, everybody, for joining today, and looking forward to continue the conversation in the coming weeks. Thank you.

A California judge has entered his judgment in Innovative Health’s lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster division, which now goes by the name Johnson & Johnson MedTech. A jury previously ruled in Innovative Health’s favor, ordering Johnson & Johnson MedTech to pay approximately $147 million in damages for withholding clinical support to healthcare providers using reprocessed catheters. Now, however, the judge has tripled the damages from $147.4 million to $442.2 million.

Judge James V. Selna of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California made his decision final on Thursday, June 5.

Background on this ruling

Arizona-based Innovative Health is a medical device reprocessing company focused exclusively on cardiology. Nearly 10 years ago, Biosense Webster stopped offering free support to customers that use reprocessed Carto 3 catheters. After that, the company only provided the service when the catheters were purchased directly from Biosense Webster. Innovative Health filed a lawsuit at that point, claiming the new policy was in violation of state and federal antitrust laws.

When the jury’s ruling on Innovative Health LLC v. Biosense Webster Inc. was announced back in May, a Johnson & Johnson MedTech representative told Cardiovascular Business the company was “disappointed” with the jury’s decision.

“We continue to believe our actions are pro-competitive and meet our responsibility to ensure patient safety and product performance,” the representative said. “We are carefully reviewing the verdict and evaluating all legal options, including appeal. Johnson & Johnson MedTech remains committed to upholding the highest standards in how we support customers and deliver critical care solutions.”

‘A seismic result’

The Association of Medical Device Reprocessors (AMDR) celebrated the update, highlighting what this represents for the medical device industry going forward.

“This is a seismic result,” Daniel J. Vukelich, president and CEO of AMDR, said in a statement. “The court not only affirmed what the jury found—that Johnson & Johnson illegally monopolized and tied the market to undermine reprocessed medical devices—but took the additional step of tripling the damages, as allowed under antitrust law. This sends an unmistakable message to all device manufacturers: anti-competitive, anti-reprocessing tactics won’t be tolerated by the courts or by hospitals committed to cost savings, sustainability, and patient care.”",https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2023-09/microsoftteams-image_40.png?h=0cc63e52&itok=XGeMhQL_,N,,2025-06-06 16:08:03.188307

National TV advertising revenue (broadcast/cable network and syndication) is estimated to sink 11.4% to $35.3 billion this year -- with national pure-play connected TV platforms such as premium streamers rising 26% to $7.8 billion, according to projections from Madison and Wall.

Total national TV advertising revenue (including CTV) will fall 6.3% in 2025 (6.1% excluding political advertising) to $43.2 billion.

Although Brian Wieser, media analyst of Madison & Wall, sees the advertising revenue share of connected CTV for national TV networks rising to a 23% share in the fourth quarter 2025 versus 17% share in the fourth quarter 2024, he says:

“For the year, CTV will be relatively flat because of last year’s political spending, but excluding its growth should be closer to 10%. Overall, including national, local and connected TV ad inventory, we continue to expect a low single digit level of ongoing declines on an ex-political basis for the medium.”

Wieser’s pure-play CTV platform data estimates exclude YouTube.

Local broadcast and cable TV advertising revenues -- will see major declines as expected, coming off the big political Presidential election 2024 year -- dropping 27.2% to $17.3 billion for all of 2025. Taking out political ads, the decline is just 3.5%.

In 2024, local TV took in $6.6 billion in political advertising. This year -- an off-political season with significantly less political advertising -- $750.6 million is projected.

Going forward, Wieser believes a better measure for TV in general is to look at all legacy TV businesses -- national, local, digital platforms (including CTV) -- in total.

“Because of the increasingly blurry lines between what is considered national and what is considered local -- a connected TV buy on a national platform may tap into the local markets that local stations otherwise served exclusively -- we are increasingly of the view that the combined local and national total, ex-political, is the right headline number for the medium.”

For that view, national/local TV/CTV advertising for the entire year of 2025 is estimated to sink 13.5% to $60.5 billion -- down 5.4% -- without the big political advertising revenues of a year ago.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/06/06/ustvadrevs-600_pQMtKPs.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 16:07:17.318435

It is the central component of ArcelorMittal’s US$1.8 billion expansion project in Liberia – bringing the company’s total investment in Liberia to date to approximately US$3 billion – which will see production increase from current levels of 5Mt of iron ore a year, to 20Mt, alongside a significant improvement in product quality to higher-grade, higher-value iron ore.

Speaking at the event, Liberia's President commented: “This level of expansion of investment is a testament to the increasing confidence in the security and well-being of the state, as well as the current state and future direction of this country’s investment climate. This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation. We are informed that this has already created over 5,000 on-site construction jobs and is expected to generate 1,000 permanent job roles upon its completion.""

The expansion project also involved investment in accompanying infrastructure assets. The railway from Tokadeh to Buchanan is being upgraded, while a new pier has been added at the port of Buchanan, along with associated material handling infrastructure.

5,000 contractors have been brought in to support the project, in addition to the 2,000 people permanently employed by ArcelorMittal in Liberia.

Part of this contribution has related to significant infrastructure upgrades, including roads, townships and power generation, which I hope will have a broader positive impact on the local economy.

How to determine if you have a recalled air conditioner?","A home appliance company whose window air conditioners were chosen as the New York Times’ best units has recalled 1.7 million of the devices due to possible mold growth leading to sickness.

The New York Times (NYT) listed the Midea U Window Air Conditioner as the number one contender on the newspaper's list of six best air conditioners of 2025, while the U+ model won runner-up. The units were recently recalled because pooled water in the air conditioners may not drain quickly enough, leading to mold growth and possible health issues.

“Mold exposure poses risks of respiratory issues or other infections to some consumers,” according to Midea.

The recall was issued on June 5, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). About 1.7 million of the devices have been recalled, and about 45,900 were sold in Canada, according to the announcement.

There have been at least 152 reports of mold in the air conditioners, including 17 reports of customers suffering from respiratory infections, allergic reactions, coughing, sneezing or sore throats from mold exposure, Midea said.

Where were the recalled air conditioners sold?

The recalled air conditioners were made in China and Thailand and sold under brand names such as Comfort Aire, Danby, Frigidaire, Insignia, Keystone, LBG Products, Mr. Cool, Perfect Aire and Sea Breeze.

The units were sold at Costco, Menards, Home Depot, Best Buy and other stores nationwide and online at Midea.com, Amazon.com, Costco.com, Menards.com, HomeDepot.com, Lowes.com, Walmart.com, BJs.com, BestBuy.com, and other websites between March 2020 and May 2025. The unit prices were listed between $280 and $500.

""This U-shaped Midea air conditioner is the quietest model we’ve ever tested, and it’s designed in a way that still allows you to open your window. But the installation process isn’t fun,"" the New York Times wrote about the U model.

Regarding the runner-up U+ model, the NYT said the ""Plus has improved efficiency and some minor feature upgrades. A redesigned bracket improves the installation process (slightly).""

The NYT added an editor's note once the paper got wind of the recall.

How to determine if you have a recalled air conditioner?

The recalled air conditioners were designed to fit in windows, and they were sold in three sizes of cooling power, including 8,000, 10,000 and 12,000 British Thermal Units (BTU).

The air conditioners measure about 22 inches wide and 14 inches high, and the model number can be found on a label on the front right side of the unit, Midea said. The units have remote controls and can also be controlled with a mobile app.

Impacted model numbers include:

What is Midea doing to fix the issue?

Customers with recalled air conditioners must contact Midea, the company said, for a free repair or a full or prorated refund based on the purchase date or the date the product was made.

Customers who want a refund will have to send the unit back to Midea using a free shipping label or submit a photograph showing that they cut the unplugged power cord of the unit.

Those who want their units repaired must contact Midea so a technician can install a new drain plug or send customers a repair kit that includes a new drain plug and bubble level, depending on the unit model.

Customers who continue using the air conditioners while awaiting a repair should visit www.MideaUrecall.expertinquiry.com for instructions on how to inspect their unit prior to continuing use.

What should I do if I have one of the recalled units?

Consumers have multiple options to contact the company, including:

But though the award is meant to celebrate the iPhone maker’s iconic body of advertising work over the years, it comes as Apple faces backlash over recent campaigns.

It's the second time that Apple has received the Creative Marketer of the Year award, first winning it in 2019. The honor went to Unilever in 2024 and to AB InBev in 2023.

“Apple has fostered a culture that prioritises creativity and innovation, and that shows up in its deep understanding of meaningful marketing,"" said Simon Cook, Lions' CEO in a statement announcing the award in March.

Recent misses: Though it’s a notable award for Apple, its creative marketing has received rare, vocal backlash over the last year.

Apple's May 2024 iPad Pro ""Crush!"" ad campaign featured a hydraulic press slowly demolishing a wide variety of creative and musical tools including cameras, a piano, and an arcade cabinet. The ad caught wide-ranging criticism for its perceived destruction of artistic devices.

Last July, Apple was criticized across social media for a promotional video set in Thailand that many viewers felt did not represent the modern experience of the country.

Apple apologized for both ads. Tor Myhren, vice president of marketing communications at Apple, told Ad Age that the company ""missed the mark"" with the ""Crush!"" spot. And Apple expressed regret for ""not fully capturing the vibrancy of Thailand today” in a statement for the promotional video.

Additionally, Apple was hit with a false advertising lawsuit this spring. The class action suit alleges that in delaying its Apple Intelligence features, the tech giant falsely advertised them by saying they would be available in the upcoming iPhone lineup.

The big picture: Advertising hiccups aren't the only headwinds Apple has experienced over the last year.

President Donald Trump's tariffs have shaken up Apple's supply chain, and CEO Tim Cook said they expect the trade war will cost them $900 million in the current quarter.

Last month in Epic Games' longstanding antitrust case against Apple, a federal judge ordered Apple to loosen its control over its App Store and allow developers to offer alternative payment options.

The bottom line: From Apple's classic ""1984"" commercial to its long-running iPod ""Silhouette"" campaign, the tech giant has made an undisputed mark on the advertising landscape. Even if the last year has been uneven.","https://www.emarketer.com/content/storage/socialsharingdefault/default-image-share.png?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=628",N,,2025-06-06 15:07:58.043328

FEATURED PANELISTS Keith Bendes – Linqia Linda Bethea – Danone","At a time when culture moves quickly and content is ubiquitous, Danone is redefining the marketing playbook along with Linqia, its agency of record and one of the largest influencer agencies in the world.

Linqia’s chief strategy officer, Keith Bendes, sat down with Danone’s chief marketing officer, Linda Bethea, and executive creative director, Eric Flinn, at ADWEEK’s 2025 Social Media Week in May to discuss their ever-evolving marketing strategy and philosophy.

For Danone, creator marketing is an important part of its current strategy because the path to purchase for younger consumers has changed.

“The traditional linear marketing funnel is dead,” Bethea said, calling brand engagement a “continuous loop of discovery” thanks to the rise of social media and influencers.

Bethea sees her job as making sure the consumers are targeted throughout the whole loop: “I need to make sure that our content and our brands are engaging with them at the right moment, at the right time, in the right place.”

Embracing failure in creator marketing

Interestingly, part of Danone’s influencer marketing playbook is trial and error, which includes failure. But Bethea doesn’t see it that way.

“We believe that you have to take risks to get rewards,” she said. “You should be just as proud of the [content] that sucks because you learn from them and do better next time.”

“It’s probably the only space in the company where there’s more appetite for failure, in social,” Flinn agreed.

In embracing the possibility of failure, Danone has created a system to turn creative risk into an advantage.

“We have a system of green, yellow, red—like what are the things that make [content] more risky,” Flinn said. “That way, when the moments pop up and things are timely, it’s easier to make those [decisions] based on some frameworks and guardrails.”

Finding the right creator

Being nimble and able to respond in the moment means that Danone seeks influencer partnerships that are organic and authentic.

“We have a portfolio of over 20 brands, and it’s important that we understand the brand purpose, the brand positioning, and the target audience for each,” Bethea said.

By doing so, Danone can bring a brand to life in an authentic way.

One example of this was partnering Oikos, a Greek yogurt brand, with powerlifter influencer Anatoly. In the video, Anatoly pretends to be a lowly janitor cleaning a gym, but after eating just a spoonful of Oikos, he’s able to lift more than the gym’s beefiest guys.

“Oikos is a brand known for strength,” Bethea said. “So, this absolutely made sense for this brand.”

Flinn welcomes the rise of non-celebrity influencers, and Linqia helps Danone keep track of under-the-radar creators so they can move quickly. When there’s a cultural moment to be capitalized on, they already know who the right creators are to respond.

“You have to move very fast,” Flinn said.

An evolution in sampling

Digital creator marketing is also changing how sampling is done, and Danone is already thinking ahead. Flinn remembered that they used to do a “sampling tour” at a brick-and-mortar location, but now they make it content.

In several “person on the street”-style videos, influencers ask random people about several Danone products. It’s charming and fun, and Flinn sees this as gamifying sampling by creating a human connection, rather than traditional sampling methods.

Even Bendes of Linqia chimed in, saying there’s been a high level of engagement with those styles of content: “It just looks different, feels different, stops the scroll.”

“Why not bring efficiency to everything we do,” Flinn said, agreeing. “And it’s authentic because it’s out there in real life, not just produced behind the camera.”

It’s clear Danone is changing with the times, staying ahead of the curve to bring world-class marketing to its family of brands. But it comes down to a simple idea, according to Bethea.

“It goes back to understanding the role of social and influencers in your overarching marketing strategy, because everything is playing a specific role,” Bethea said.

Airbnb is shaking up its marketing leadership team, naming a new head marketer while a veteran of the company moves into a new role.

The company appointed Rebecca Van Dyck CMO, while Hiroki Asai, who has served as Airbnb global head of marketing since 2020, takes on the title chief experience officer.

Van Dyck began working with Airbnb in a consultative capacity earlier this year.

“As a lifelong traveler, I have personally experienced how Airbnb has changed the way we travel,” Van Dyck said in a statement.

She will report to Asai, who will continue to oversee marketing, design, product and community teams for Airbnb, while embedding more within Airbnb’s product roadmap.

Van Dyck is a veteran marketer who most recently spent two years as COO, Reality Labs at Meta, following stints as CMO for the company’s Reality Labs AR/VR and the Oculus Rift VR headset prior to that. She first joined Meta back it was known as Facebook, arriving as vice president of consumer and brand marketing in 2012 after spending about a year as CMO for Levi Strauss & Co.

Wells Fargo grabbed the spotlight after S&P Global upgraded its outlook to 'positive' following the removal of a $1.95 trillion asset cap, sparking a rise in the bank's stock.

What does this mean?

The US Federal Reserve slapped an asset cap on Wells Fargo in 2018 to promote responsible practices and improve governance. Now, with notable strides in governance, risk management, and compliance, S&P Global has upped the bank's outlook. This recognition sent Wells Fargo's stock soaring to a three-month high, gaining 8.3% this year, while the S&P 500 remained steady. With these chains off, Wells Fargo is gearing up to bolster its commercial and investment banking divisions.

Why should I care?

For markets: A path clear to expansion.

Wells Fargo's newfound freedom could shake up the banking competition. With plans to expand in commercial and investment sectors, it might challenge the dominance of top rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, who thrived while Wells Fargo was sidelined.

The bigger picture: Banking's balancing act.

This move highlights the importance of strong governance for financial stability and winning back regulatory trust. As global economic challenges continue, Wells Fargo's makeover could inspire others to prioritize governance reforms, showing that patience and strategic improvements can yield rewards in big finance.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L3N3S915Y.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=0ea541e0bbf3d4481d3b203ecd7ce7e9,N,,2025-06-06 17:08:39.999095

A 2022 study from the European Commission found that 97 percent of popular EU websites employed at least one type of dark pattern.
In Germany, consumer group vzbv identified what it classifies as “hyper-engaging dark patterns” on SHEIN’s platform, combining gamification and urgency to keep users clicking and buying.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has warned that dark patterns are not only deceptive but often illegal, especially when they impair consumer choice, obscure material terms, or undermine cancellation rights.
In its 2022 report, Bringing Dark Patterns to Light, the FTC identified the growing use of these tactics across e-commerce and digital services, stating it would pursue enforcement against firms using dark patterns to extract consumer consent, money, or data without genuine transparency.","As one of the most downloaded shopping apps globally and a dominant force in the ultra-fast fashion economy, SHEIN has built a business model around real-time data, rapid production cycles, low pricing, and relentless consumer engagement. But beneath the surface of its sleek digital storefront lies a system of design tactics that is coming under fire, with experts characterizing SHEIN’s model as engineered to manipulate behavior, drive overconsumption, and potentially breach consumer protection laws.

Known as “dark patterns,” these tactics range from countdown timers and low-stock alerts to emotionally manipulative prompts like “Are you sure you want to leave?” They are not unique to SHEIN – but according to the European Consumer Organisation (“BEUC”) and 25 member groups across 21 countries, the platform exemplifies the most aggressive use of such strategies in the fast fashion space. In a complaint filed with the European Commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network, BEUC asserts that these interface choices aren’t merely clever marketing – they may constitute unfair commercial practices under the EU’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.

The Psychology of the Scroll

Dark patterns – also called deceptive design – are digital techniques that distort user decision-making through interface manipulation rather than explicit misinformation. Examples flagged in SHEIN’s platform include confirm-shaming, persistent pop-ups, “flash sale” pressure, and FOMO-inducing messages such as “2k+ sold” or “Only a few left.” These designs capitalize on what psychologists call “System 1” thinking: the fast, emotional, instinctive part of decision-making that is more vulnerable to nudges and pressure.

A 2022 study from the European Commission found that 97 percent of popular EU websites employed at least one type of dark pattern. But SHEIN’s scale and intensity stand out. The Fédération Romande des Consommateurs in Switzerland found that SHEIN used 18 of 20 manipulative patterns studied – more than H&M, Zara, or ASOS. In Germany, consumer group vzbv identified what it classifies as “hyper-engaging dark patterns” on SHEIN’s platform, combining gamification and urgency to keep users clicking and buying.

This issue has also attracted the attention of regulators in the United States. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has warned that dark patterns are not only deceptive but often illegal, especially when they impair consumer choice, obscure material terms, or undermine cancellation rights. In its 2022 report, Bringing Dark Patterns to Light, the FTC identified the growing use of these tactics across e-commerce and digital services, stating it would pursue enforcement against firms using dark patterns to extract consumer consent, money, or data without genuine transparency.

Beyond Interface: The Externalities of Fast Fashion

These design practices extend beyond digital rights concerns; they fuel a physical chain of environmental and public health costs, according to BEUC. In 2022, SHEIN launched an estimated 315,000 new product listings – more than 45 times as many as Zara. The result is a glut of low-cost garments with short lifespans, much of which ends up as textile waste. Several BEUC members also documented hazardous chemicals in SHEIN’s clothing, including illegal PFAS in jackets and phthalates in children’s slippers.

At the labor level, BEUC highlights that investigations in 2024 and 2025 revealed severe labor rights concerns at SHEIN suppliers in China, including excessive working hours, underpayment, and in some cases, child labor. These findings challenge the company’s claims of sustainability and responsible sourcing, and raise questions about the true costs behind the app’s “limited-time deals.”

The complaint filed by BEUC urges EU authorities to require SHEIN to cease the use of dark patterns across its EU-facing platforms. It also calls on regulators to demand proof that claims like “low stock” or recent purchase activity are genuine – or prohibit them if not. Importantly, the complaint does not stop with SHEIN: it urges a broader crackdown on similar practices across the fast fashion industry, including platforms like Boohoo, H&M, and Zara.

A Model Under Scrutiny

This legal push comes amid the EU’s development of a proposed “Digital Fairness Act” that could codify restrictions on dark patterns and algorithmic manipulation more broadly. If regulators act, the implications may extend well beyond one retailer, prompting a rethink of how consumer protection law applies in a platform-dominated economy. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the FTC’s work signals a growing consensus among global regulators that dark patterns are no longer a grey area – they are increasingly being recognized as a form of digital misconduct requiring legal redress.

SHEIN’s model is built on speed, scale, and stickiness – qualities that, in the EU and U.S., are increasingly being viewed through the lens of legal compliance and ethical design. The complaint against SHEIN is not just about e-commerce tricks. It is a challenge to the architecture of digital retail itself: one where data-driven persuasion meets environmental degradation, and where the cost of a €2 top may be far higher than it seems.",https://www.thefashionlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/highxtar-shein-del-anonimato-al-imperio-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 20:06:58.636132

This state-of-the-art facility, nestled in Nimba County, is now one of the largest private sector investments in Liberia since the end of the civil war.

The inauguration underscores Liberia’s growing profile as a destination for long-term, high-impact investment and showcases its evolving role within global iron ore markets. With the plant scheduled to commence full operations later this month, stakeholders anticipate broad-based economic dividends and industrial growth.

A Project Years in the Making

Originally conceived in 2012, the concentrator project encountered delays due to the 2014 Ebola outbreak, forcing a pause in construction. Work resumed in 2021, following updated engineering designs and the integration of modern mining technologies that bring the plant in line with global standards.

Now completed, the facility is expected to enhance ore processing efficiency, facilitate the production of high-grade iron ore concentrates, and significantly boost Liberia’s export capabilities.

President Boakai: A Vision of Confidence and Transformation

Speaking at the commissioning ceremony, President Boakai hailed the plant as a “testament to the resilience of Liberia and the enduring confidence of international investors.”

“This level of investment is a strong vote of confidence in Liberia’s stability, our economic policies, and the potential of our people,” President Boakai declared. “We are not just building infrastructure. We are building hope, jobs, capacity, and national pride.”

President Boakai, who toured the facility alongside ArcelorMittal executives and government officials, said the impact of the project extended well beyond capital inflows.

Economic Impact and Job Creation

The Mt. Tokadeh expansion has already yielded more than 5,000 construction jobs, with the plant expected to create over 1,000 permanent employment opportunities in operations, engineering, logistics, and support services.

President Boakai emphasized that the true measure of this project lies in its impact on people’s lives.

“This brings relief to our economy. Families now have breadwinners, young people are gaining skills, and communities are seeing growth,” he said.

He encouraged further local hiring, skill development initiatives, and inclusive growth strategies that will help integrate Liberians into long-term roles across the mining value chain.

Beyond the Plant: A Broader Investment Roadmap

President Boakai called on ArcelorMittal Liberia to continue advancing its additional investment commitments, including:

Railway Expansion to boost ore transport and regional integration

Port Enhancement to increase export capacity at Buchanan

Power Plant Installations to support energy independence and industrial scaling

“We commend ArcelorMittal Liberia for this bold step, but we are equally focused on seeing the full investment roadmap realized,” the President noted. “These projects are not just national infrastructure—they are regional catalysts.”

Corporate Social Responsibility: A Shared Obligation

Highlighting the critical role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), President Boakai urged ArcelorMittal to scale its outreach and deepen its investments in education, healthcare, local commerce, and infrastructure.

“A project of this magnitude must not only benefit shareholders, but it must enrich the lives of our people—through schools, clinics, and market development,” he asserted.

He emphasized the value of sustainable development and community inclusion, adding that corporate success and national progress must go hand-in-hand.

Government Commitment to Investment Stability

In his closing remarks, President Boakai offered gratitude to engineers, workers, community leaders, and investors, acknowledging their vital role in transforming the long-awaited project into a reality.

He reaffirmed the Liberian Government’s commitment to protecting investments, honoring agreements, and fostering a peaceful, enabling environment for both local and foreign businesses.

“We want to assure you that the full benefits of this project will be realized by our people. We are committed to ensuring there are no disruptions—only progress, unity, and shared prosperity,” he concluded.

About the Project

The Concentrator Plant will process iron ore into high-grade concentrate suitable for export, positioning Liberia as a more competitive player in the global steel and ore markets. As part of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II expansion in Liberia, the project will also lead to the development of critical auxiliary infrastructure, including transport and energy systems—laying the groundwork for future industrialization in the country.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/20_11_2023_14_56_29_860235.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 15:08:05.112638

Data from Placer.ai shows that May traffic at the chain was up just 0.5% versus May 2024.

Conversely, McDonald’s A Minecraft Movie Meal and A Minecraft Movie Happy Meal launch April 1 had the opposite effect — driving a 12.2% year-over-year visitation lift in its early days and a 3.9% bump in April overall.

Notably, McDonald’s traffic was -1% year-over-year in March and up 2.1% in January (February numbers were skewed by last year’s Leap Day).

Placer.ai head of analytical research R.J. Hottovy said the timing of the McCrispy Strips launch may have impacted some traffic numbers.

“The Minecraft Meal was very successful. It’s hard to do back-to-back promotions, especially following ones that are successful,” he said.

The flat traffic also indicates an increasingly crowded space as more chains shift their focus to chicken. Taco Bell, for instance, brought back its Crispy Chicken Nuggets April 24, just ahead of McDonald’s launch.

“Chicken is getting more competitive, there is no doubt about that,” Hottovy said. “More chains are relying on chicken products to differentiate themselves. It is versatile, it can be used for both value and premium, you can innovate with sauces. There’s a lot of growth in chicken and it’s only going to get more competitive.”

That said, Hottovy is bullish on McDonald’s second quarter given strong April numbers. Some analysts, however, seem less optimistic. In a note published Friday, Loop Capital analyst Alton Stump wrote, ""Our contacts pointed out that the new chicken strips had far less breading, which created a superior taste profile for the chicken meat itself, but also a product that was less attractive and smaller in appearance compared to (McDonald’s) previous offerings as well as chicken fingers on the menu currently among most of the company’s top competitors.”

Regardless, the McCrispy Strips were a necessary launch, Hottovy said, as they set the base for the much-anticipated return of the chain’s Snack Wraps July 10. Though consumers have been demanding their return for years, that doesn’t mean it will be an automatic win for McDonald’s. The competition for wraps is just as intense, with Popeyes, KFC, Burger King, Sonic Drive-In, Wendy’s, and more throwing their hats in the ring.

The chicken category has continued to drive much of the industry’s growth of late, including a nearly 15% sales increase for the top 500 chicken chains in 2024, according to Technomic data. That is compared to the overall industry, which grew by just over 3%.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltea7aee2fca050a19/blt5b20c2d7ed85c5e5/6814f67882960b014910b8c0/McCrispy_strips.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-06 17:08:24.433351

What you may have missed

Nike names Tony Bignell chief innovation officer

About a week after a Nike internal memo revealed long-term veteran John Hoke would retire as chief innovation officer, the brand has found his replacement. Tony Bignell, vice president of running and footwear, will take over the position and begin transitioning into the role with the help of Hoke effective immediately. Hoke does not officially retire until October.

Bignell, who has spent more than 20 years at Nike and nine leading its footwear innovation team, will report to Chief Innovation, Design and Product Officer Phil McCartney. McCartney himself took on his current role just last month. Bignell has already been a part of the development of key Nike franchises, including VaporMax and Joyride, and led a reset for Nike’s running business, according to an internal memo.

In the new position, Bignell will be responsible for innovation across brands, products, sports and platforms. His replacement as vice president of running and footwear will soon be announced.

Huda Beauty founder buys back brand

Huda Beauty founder and co-CEO Huda Kattan has bought back her equity in the brand, giving her full control of the company.

TSG Consumer Partners in 2017 acquired a minority stake in Huda Beauty.

""Taking back full ownership of Huda Beauty is a deeply very important moment for me,"" Kattan said in a statement. ""It says that while many of us dreamers have visions that we are told are too big or not possible to do alone, in actuality, you have all the power you need to change the world yourself! This brand was built on passion, creativity, and a desire to challenge the beauty industry. As we step into this new chapter, I'm more committed than ever to pushing boundaries, staying true to our roots, and showing up for our incredible community every step of the way.""

Kattan will serve as co-CEO with her husband, Christopher Goncalo, while her sister, Alya Kattan, will lead the brand’s social strategy.

Prose launches West Coast customization center

AI-powered custom hair and skin care DTC brand Prose opened a new customization center in Commerce, California to serve its customer base on the West Coast.

Prose invested $9 million into the customization center, which mirrors the company’s flagship Brooklyn location and spans 43,000 square feet.

""This expansion marks a significant step forward in Prose's evolution, enabling us to meet growing demand from customers across the U.S. and Canada,"" Prose CEO and co-founder Arnaud Plas said in a statement. ""We look forward to leveraging this new state-of-the-art customization center to further drive personalized beauty solutions and set a new standard for the industry.""

Opening the center will cut carbon emissions in half and reduce shipping time, according to the brand. The automated system for the made-to-order manufacturing process also minimizes excess waste and reduces the company’s carbon footprint, per Prose.

Take home a piece of ‘Twin Peaks’

After passing earlier this year, items from American filmmaker David Lynch’s estate are now up for auction. “The Collection of David Lynch” auction will take place June 18 online and live in Los Angeles, according to the late visionary’s official Facebook account.

The auction features almost 450 pieces from Lynch’s personal archive with items like his director’s chair, prop diner menus from “Mulholland Drive” and Lynch's personal 35mm print of his debut film “Eraserhead,” to name a few.

When I dip, you dip, we dip

Hellmann's Mayonnaise is kicking off summer nuptial season by hosting a giveaway to one lucky couple of a dip-inspired wedding in Las Vegas.

The event will be held ahead of national chicken tender day, and honors Hellmann’s new chicken tender dips, including buttermilk ranch, spicy ranch and garlic Parmesan.

The wedding experience includes a ceremony officiated by Hellmann’s mascot, Manny Mayo, a reception featuring a chicken tender tower, a professional photographer and a $5,000 stipend to go toward travel expenses.

What we’re still thinking about

8.5%

That’s how much net revenue decreased year over year at Lands’ End in Q1, coming in at $261.2 million. Net loss was $8.3 million, an increase of 28% compared to the year-ago quarter, according to a company press release.

“This period marked significant progress in strengthening the resiliency of our diversified supply chain, positioning us to maintain momentum throughout fiscal 2025,” CEO Andrew McLean said in a statement regarding the quarter.

The apparel retailer is currently exploring strategic alternatives including a sale or merger, but is not making any further public comment on the process until it determines that disclosure is appropriate.

2%

That’s how much PVH Corp.’s revenue increased year over year in Q1, coming in at $1.98 billion. Tommy Hilfiger’s revenue was up 3%, while Calvin Klein was flat. The company swung to a net loss of $44.8 million, compared to a net income of $151.4 million in the year-ago quarter.

“Looking ahead, we’re focused on what we can control, stepping up our actions to scale the impact of our stronger product, next-level cut-through campaigns, and sharper marketplace execution across both brands,” CEO Stefan Larsson said in a statement. “This will both strengthen the back half of this year, and continue to move us toward our long-term goal of building Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world.”

What we’re watching

What a security breach means for Victoria’s Secret – and retail more widely

After postponing its Q1 report due to a cybersecurity breach affecting its information technology systems, Victoria’s Secret will release its results Wednesday.

The episode interfered with the retailer’s Memorial Day sale and added to the headwinds buffeting its turnaround, per emailed comments from Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow. The lingerie retailer is already under “tariff-induced margin pressure and an increased recession risk for a sensitive consumer discretionary business,” Boruchow said.

Victoria’s Secret is not alone. Retailers and brands here and abroad in recent weeks have suffered cybersecurity attacks, including Adidas and The North Face. In April, retail was the seventh most attacked industry in the U.S, and over the past six months retailers faced more than 950 cyberattacks per week on average, according to Check Point Research.

Adam Marrè, chief information security officer at cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf, sees “a pattern that suggests a deliberate campaign against the retail sector.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xgUIQbchh-Kc3XSPF7B9zDEWONmWB8_t1JInN2U1BiI/g:nowe:477:0/c:3554:2007/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUctMTU3MS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-06 14:11:47.476015

By Maggie Mancini

Work-related stress exerts a greater influence on the mental health of Hong Kong’s workforce compared to the global average, according to research from AXA. Among the affected demographics, young millennials and Gen Z face the most severe mental health challenges. They experience higher rates of stress, anxiety, and depression and take sick leave more frequently due to mental health-related issues.

The study presents a concerning picture of Hong Kong’s workforce grappling with elevated stress levels and mental health challenges, with 80% of the working populations citing multiple factors influencing their well-being, including uncertainty about the future in a rapidly changing world (58%), financial instability and job insecurity (58%), difficulty achieving work-life balance (53%), and loneliness and social isolation (45%). Work-related stress is particularly acute in Hong Kong, higher than the global average (56%).

Pressure at work has become an invisible burden, impacting both mental and physical well-being. Approximately 84% of the working population indicates that work-related stress interferes with their daily lives, citing issues such as sleep disturbances (36%), decreased motivation (33%), physical symptoms (26%), mood swings or irritability (25%), difficulties in concentrating (22%), and changes in appetite (19%).

The study finds that 23% of the working population has taken sick leave due to mental health issues. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations, with 40% of Gen Z having done so — the highest among all age groups. The rate declines noticeably with age: 33% of young millennials, 26% of older millennials, and 20% of those ages 45 to 54 — only half the rate of Gen Z.

With the growing prevalence of technology, 29% of respondents report using mental health applications or services to manage their well-being. The tools they are most interested in include AI-driven sleep tracking apps (66%), digital journaling (60%), mindfulness and meditation apps (59%), and AI-powered virtual therapist chatbots (57%). Usage rates show significant generational differences: Gen Z has the highest adoption rate (46%), followed by younger millennials (41%). In contrast, only 15% of respondents aged 55 and above use AI for mind health management, highlighting the greater popularity of digital mind health tools among younger generations.

Notably, around 60% of working individuals expect companies to implement more comprehensive mental health workplace policies. This demand is particularly pronounced among younger generations, with 70% of Gen Z and 82% of younger millennials expressing such expectations.",https://www.hrotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Axa.png,N,,2025-06-06 14:10:47.832967

Dive Brief:

Clothing brands H&M and Eileen Fisher achieved the top ranking on a new scorecard that evaluated how some of the biggest fashion companies are progressing on phasing out fossil fuels.

The scorecard from climate group Stand.earth graded 42 fashion brands on a scale of “A+” to “F” based on progress they made to decarbonize their supply chains between 2021 and 2023. The group accounted for impact across five areas: clean energy transition; sustainability commitments and transparency; climate advocacy and engagement; use of low-carbon materials and circularity; and adoption of green shipping methods.

H&M led the list with an overall score of “B+,” followed by Eileen Fisher with a “B-.” Meanwhile six brands earned an “F,” including fast fashion retailers Shein and Boohoo and sports apparel producers Under Armour and Columbia.

Dive Insight:

The report is the follow-up toStand.earth’s 2023 Fossil Free Fashion Scorecard; the climate group did not publish an edition last year. H&M ranked first in the previous scorecard as well, with an overall score of “B-,” while Eileen Fisher had a “C” and has since moved up due to its progress in sustainable strategy and decarbonization across its operations.

Stand.earth’s latest report noted that production of clothing linked to fossil fuels contributed at least 4% of global emissions in 2024,echoing other comments sustainability experts have made about the fashion industry’s impact on global warming and increased emissions.

“The fashion industry must urgently correct course by ending its dependency on fossil fuels for manufacturing, transportation, and raw materials,” the June 3 report said. “Rapid, just, and worker-centered action by brands has never been more essential for an industry that remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Stand.earth’s analysis of the brands’ environmental impact found that Shein increased its scope 3 emissions by over 170% in a span of just two years, overall emitting almost as much pollution as the entire country of Lebanon. The report also said clothing brands Abercrombie & Fitch, Aritzia and Columbia had yet to set a target for scope 3 emissions, a void that put them behind their competitors and “dangerously out of step with climate action.”

The climate group said the lack of any brands scoring an “A” grade “reflects the reality that the industry has a lot of work left to do to end its close symbiosis with the harmful fossil fuel industry.”

A 2021 World Economic Forum report found that the fashion industry and its supply chain were the world’s third-largest polluter. A separate study from the European Parliament states that the sector emitted almost 10% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions annually, more than those generated by international flights and maritime shipping combined.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mEedzXjtru3RKq23XQkIS3E0FqUW2uCsLEpc_HiwSYc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDA1ODcwOTAxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-06 15:08:40.473276

It's handing its global media planning and buying business to Publicis, covering international campaigns, including those for major film franchises.

The entertainment giant is reportedly planning a Transformers release next year.

The U.S. media for streaming service Paramount+ will now be managed by Interpublic Group’s Mediabrands.

Horizon Media previously oversaw that portion.

Together, the reassigned media accounts total around $600 million in annual billings.

The decision, described as cost-driven and abrupt, comes as the entertainment company positions itself for an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.

Cost-Cutting Measures Ahead of Skydance Deal

This change occurred without a formal agency review process, surprising many internally.

According to Deadline, the company informed only select staff and partners before word began to circulate.

Industry insiders point to operational streamlining as a key driver, as Paramount navigates prolonged merger proceedings and growing budget pressure.

Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have already signed off on the Skydance deal, but the FCC has yet to begin a substantial review.

The unresolved legal dispute with President Donald Trump, who is suing Paramount-owned CBS News, adds another layer of uncertainty.

The pending litigation accuses the news division of misrepresentation during coverage of former Vice President Kamala Harris and could influence merger timelines.

With its media buying and planning business now split between two major holding companies, Paramount signals that it's prioritizing tighter financial control.

This decisive agency realignment sets a precedent for media conglomerates facing similar pressures to adapt swiftly to market dynamics.

It shows the importance of agility and cost-effectiveness in agency partnerships, potentially influencing industry standards for media account management.

Our Take: Smart Move or Just Cost-Cutting?

This looks less like a routine vendor switch and more like a calculated move to reset priorities ahead of big changes.

Agencies should take note. Long-term relationships are no longer safe if they don't show clear value.

Publicis and IPG likely won this business because they offered tighter budgets, clearer workflows, or both.

For entertainment brands, this is a cue to reevaluate agency partnerships. Ask questions like:

Where are the dollars working? Where are they not?

Are we getting full transparency on media buying costs and performance?

Is our agency proactively optimizing spend based on real-time data?

With streaming margins under scrutiny and consolidation looming, cost control and execution speed will only become more important.

The Michaels Companies announced on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of Joann's intellectual property and private label brands — in an acquisition that arrives as the Texas-based arts and crafting chain works to expand its own fabric, sewing and yarn offerings.

“We’re honored to have the opportunity to welcome JOANN customers into our creative community and are committed to delivering the selection, value, and inspiration they are looking for at Michaels,” Michaels CEO David Boone said in a statement. The deal, he added, allows the company to better “respond to rising demand” among both new and existing customers.

Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The Associated Press reached out to Michaels for further information on Friday.

With roots dating back to a single Ohio storefront in 1943, Joann had grown into a destination for generations of sewers, quilters, knitters and lovers of other crafts for more than 80 years. But more recently, operational challenges continued to pile up — with the retailer pointing to sluggish consumer demand, inventory shortages and rising competition.

Joann announced it would be going out of business back in February, just one month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year. At the time, the company said financial services company GA Group, together with Joann’s term lenders, had been selected as the winning bidder to “acquire substantially all of Joann’s assets” and conduct going-out-of-business sales at all store locations.

Michaels on Thursday said that its purchase of Joann's IP and private brands included the acquisition of “Big Twist” yarns, which had become a staple in Joann stores over the years.

Those “Big Twist” labels are now being developed as part of Michaels' portfolio — and will be available in-stores and online later this year, the company said. In the meantime, Michaels has also dedicated a landing page to welcome former Joann customers online.

And as part of its overall expansion into fabrics, Michaels said on Thursday that its adding more than 600 new products from new and existing brands — including quilting supplies and fabrics, specialty threads, sewing machines and more.

Michaels, founded in 1973, currently operates 1,300 stores across 49 U.S. states and Canada. Its parent company also owns Artistree, a framing merchandise manufacturer.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has warned that semaglutide-based drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus may increase the risk of a rare eye condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), which can cause permanent vision loss. The EMA’s safety committee (PRAC) launched a review in January and found that NAION is a “very rare” side effect, potentially affecting up to 1 in 10,000 users. People with diabetes taking semaglutide face a twofold increased risk. The EMA has recommended updating product information to reflect this risk, pending final approval from the European Commission.

The economic slowdown in China, combined with growing uncertainty in global trade, has further diminished South Africa’s competitive position in steel manufacturing.
On June 4, the Portfolio Committee on Trade, Industry and Competition held an engagement with stakeholders in the steel industry regarding the progress and outcomes of implementing the Steel Master Plan, launched in 2021.","The main contribution from the steel value chain to South Africa’s GDP comes from machinery and automotive production, along with the construction industry. From this standpoint, maximising the developmental impact of localisation requires a focus on these relatively advanced industries, Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies (TIPS) senior economist Dr Neva Makgetla has said.

Speaking as part of an expert panel during a TIPS webinar on June 5 that sought to explore options for the future of South Africa’s steel industry, she stated that crude steel production in South Africa was undergoing a structural crisis, driven by stagnant domestic and export demand combined with rapidly rising costs at ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA), the country’s only integrated steel producer.

AMSA's local sales have declined sharply and the company has written off various assets after recording losses in seven of the past 12 years.

These challenges had been compounded by increased imports, particularly from China, which benefits from cheaper access to iron-ore and coking coal. Makgetla added that the shift toward lighter materials and digital technologies had reduced the steel intensity of South Africa’s GDP.

She noted that the export parity prices for iron-ore, coal and basic steel had increased, placing additional pressure on domestic producers. She argued that the justification for government support of crude steel production was weak from an economic standpoint, but there were strong grounds for supporting downstream steel-based manufacturers, particularly those producing inputs for machinery, vehicles and construction.

While the steel industry’s direct contribution to GDP, employment and exports remained limited, she said it remained essential to public infrastructure and to the health of advanced manufacturing sectors.

The panellists, which included International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa chief commissioner Ayabonga Cawe and Cape Gate Mill chairperson Oren Kaplan, agreed that several strategic decisions and difficult trade-offs needed to be considered to stabilise and expand the domestic steel industry within a rapidly shifting global trade landscape.

Kaplan specifically noted that AMSA's struggles were ""haunting"" the steel industry and required good solutions instead of bailouts.

Makgetla estimated that upgrades at AMSA to bring it into a position of true industry competitiveness could cost about R15-billion, which was a significant investment in light of limited budget resources.

The consensus between the panellists was that any potential support for AMSA should be highly conditional on significant restructuring of the company, and that the funds should be focused on technological upgrades.

Moreover, any assistance needed to be carefully aligned with broader industrial policy goals and aimed at supporting downstream manufacturers.

Makgetla noted that the US’s recent imposition of a 50% tariff on all steel imports in early June had introduced further volatility to global markets, which in turn put more pressure on the local steel market.

US President Donald Trump indicated that the move was designed to protect and rejuvenate the US industry, though the policy had drawn criticism from international partners.

Concurrently, China, the world’s largest steel producer, reduced its steel output by 7% in April as demand waned and overcapacity continued to weigh on the sector. The economic slowdown in China, combined with growing uncertainty in global trade, has further diminished South Africa’s competitive position in steel manufacturing.

In the EU, steel import volumes have surged as a result of global trade distortions. The European Commission’s 2025 import surveillance report identified a significant increase in low-cost imports of stainless steel and related products, triggering concerns among domestic producers.

In this global context, Makgetla and other panellists emphasised the need for South Africa to adopt a multipronged strategy developed in collaboration between policymakers and industry stakeholders.

The first component of this strategy should be the development of a comprehensive national plan that realistically assesses the current and future size of the market, supports the growth and competitiveness of downstream manufacturers and prioritises technological upgrades and innovation across the value chain.

Second, the implementation of flexible policy mechanisms is identified as crucial. These should provide temporary support for transitioning technologies while promoting cost reductions throughout the industry. They should also allow market dynamics to drive competitive outcomes without excessive intervention.

Third, the panel stressed the importance of targeted investments in strategic areas. These will include the development of special steel production capabilities, the adoption of green steel technologies in line with global decarbonisation trends and the reskilling of the workforce to meet the demands of technological transformation.

Fourth, the panel urged a pragmatic approach to trade dynamics. South Africa should maintain targeted, time-bound tariff protections to shield vulnerable sectors, while actively exploring regional market opportunities within the Southern African Development Community.

The panel concurred that policymakers should also respond strategically to international trade shifts to ensure local industry is not undermined by external volatility.

Finally, fostering continuous dialogue among industry players, researchers and government bodies is deemed essential to ensure that strategies remain adaptive to changing technological, economic and geopolitical conditions.

Makgetla said the overarching objective needed to be a flexible and forward-looking policy framework that balanced the short-term needs of the steel industry with long-term goals of economic competitiveness and innovation.

The urgency of revitalising the sector has grown more pressing amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Steel Master Plan. On June 4, the Portfolio Committee on Trade, Industry and Competition held an engagement with stakeholders in the steel industry regarding the progress and outcomes of implementing the Steel Master Plan, launched in 2021.

During this session, they proposed options to reinvigorate the plan, many of which aligned with the recommendations discussed during the TIPS webinar.

Dive Brief:

G-III Apparel Group posted a first-quarter fiscal 2026 net sales decline of 4% to $583.6 million year over year, according to a Friday press release.

Net income rose nearly 40% to $7.8 million compared to the same period last year. In addition, the company’s total debt decreased 96% to $18.7 million this year compared to $426.4 million last year after G-III redeemed $400 million in senior secured notes in August 2024.

The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2026 net sales outlook of around $3.14 billion, down about 1.3% over the prior fiscal year. However, G-III withdrew its previously issued fiscal 2026 net income and adjusted EBITDA guidance due to “uncertainty around tariffs and related macroeconomic conditions,” per the release.

Dive Insight:

Despite solid Q1 results, G-III is expecting challenging financial headwinds ahead that could hurt its financial performance for the rest of the year.

Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s chairman and CEO, said in the release that the company’s Q1 performance was “fueled by double-digit growth of our key owned brands, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld and Donna Karan” and added that the performance of those brands “largely offset the exit of the Calvin Klein jeans and sportswear businesses.” He added that the results “underscore the strong demand and desirability of our brand portfolio.”

But the company said in Friday’s release that its first-half fiscal 2026 sales are expected to be lower compared to the previous year, with acceleration expected in the second half of fiscal 2026.

In addition, G-III said tariff rates in place as of June 5 would result in an additional expense of about $135 million, primarily weighted toward the second half of the year. In order to offset these costs, the company said it planned to diversify its sourcing mix and vendor discounts, as well as initiate “selective price increases and … other cost saving initiatives.”

Second-quarter net sales are expected to decline about 12% to $570 million, compared to $645 million for the same period last year, impacted in part by supply chain challenges. The company expects net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to plummet by nearly 75% to 96% to a range between $6 million and $1 million, down from $24.2 million for the second quarter last year.

In reaffirming the company’s 2026 net sales guidance, Goldfarb said G-III was “working diligently to mitigate the impact of tariffs.” He added that the company’s management team “has a proven track record of successfully navigating periods of uncertainty, and we view the ongoing disruptions as an opportunity to strengthen our competitive position and capture incremental market share.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/h1N3SW3jdhztKTmWepC7yrVTH9Shf8rzXvAGz7gzYrw/g:nowe:0:134/c:3200:1807/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTczNTAwNjE1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-06 16:08:39.747038

In a first step, the French lender plans to close around 80 branches this year and another 120 next, according to people familiar with the matter. Headcount in the branch network is expected to decline by 5 per cent a year, while staff would be added in online and phone banking.

Negotiations with labour unions, which were first informed of the strategy for the business in March, are set to continue in the coming days, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Affected employees will be offered new roles, and BNP Paribas is also counting on natural attrition to avoid layoffs, according to the people.

“We presented in March an ambitious growth plan to trade unions that outlines a strategic roadmap and related investments for our Commercial & Personal Banking in France,” a spokesperson for BNP Paribas said in an emailed statement. “Every employee of the bank has their place in this project.”

Fixing the unit is a key focus for Bonnafe, after he built up the trading business and propelled the asset management arm into the top ranks with the takeover of Axa’s investment arm agreed last year. BNP Paribas last year named Isabelle Loc to run the business, which has struggled as local regulations, costly interest rate hedges and the European Central Bank’s decision to no longer remunerate mandatory reserves weighed on earnings.

The unit is now “at a pivotal point,” chief financial officer Lars Machenil said in an interview in February. The “headwinds are basically behind us.”

Loc took over the business after its former head, Marguerite Berard, left BNP Paribas last year and went on to run Dutch lender ABN Amro Bank. She is counting on the digital unit Hello bank! as well as its private banking assets in France to grow the business.

BNP currently has around 1,500 branches in France. Under Loc’s plan, some of the business in the branches will be transferred to remote customers centres, where employees will be offered new jobs, the people said. Others may be offered positions in areas such as private banking, they said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/d080e96651d9c85a19f60994e957a98316cd9fbe9459839586ed3e9953f03098?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-06-06 13:06:40.941581

Time is overdue to curb harmful PBM practices.","As a physician, I have witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies in our health care system that make it harder for patients to access the care they need. One of these complexities patients now have to navigate is a growing industry of insurance middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), whose practices meddling in our local health system increase health care costs and block access to critical medications.

PBMs work between health insurance companies and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug prices for the health plans they represent. Their function and influence in the health care industry have evolved significantly, and today, PBMs operate with very little oversight or transparency and their decisions are often based on what is most profitable for a health plan rather than what is best for a patient.

PBMs wield significant influence over what treatments patients can access and how much they will be required to pay. These middlemen receive significant rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers for the cost of medications and treatments after negotiations, but they don’t pass those savings on to patients receiving the care, increasing what patients are required to pay out of pocket when they pick up their medication at the pharmacy counter.

PBMs can also require only certain drugs be covered by a health plan, impose arbitrary rules around access to provider-prescribed medications, and PBM revenue is often directly linked to the list price of a medicine, so PBMs are incentivized to recommend treatments that would yield the most profit.

The three largest PBMs – CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx – manage nearly 80% of prescription drug claims for 270 million people across the country. To make matters worse, PBMs are increasingly integrating and consolidating with other health care services, including distributors and pharmacies, making the influence PBMs hold over the health care system even larger. As these for-profit entities merge and collaborate, it’s unclear if the system is actually functioning in the best interest of patients regarding quality and cost of care.

PBMs have flown under the radar for far too long, but scrutiny of these middlemen and their impact on our health care system has rightfully grown in recent years, with many federal and state policymakers and regulators calling attention to the outsized role PBMs play in driving up health care costs. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that PBM integration with chain pharmacies and insurers has allowed them to dominate the broader health system and that PBMs have significant control over what drugs are available to patients and how much they are required to pay.

The FTC even filed suit against the three of the nation’s largest PBMs, citing their anticompetitive tactics as a barrier to health care access. In addition, numerous investigations found that PBMs often act in their own financial interest, including pushing patients toward drugs with higher out-of-pocket costs because it’s more profitable for the PBM.

Access to consistent treatments is necessary for Louisiana patients, particularly those living with chronic health conditions or hard-to-treat illnesses such as cancer. Each year, more than 25,000 Louisianans receive a new cancer diagnosis. Alleviating access and financial barriers to care is a necessary step to improving health outcomes for patients.

It is overwhelmingly clear that we must take action to reform PBM practices to improve access to care for patients and stop letting middlemen meddle in our health system. There has never been a time when we can do more for patients as doctors, but at the same time, there has never been a time when we have more complexities in the health care systems impede healthcare access and affordability. This “profit over patients” business model is putting critical care out of reach for many Louisiana patients. Time is overdue to curb harmful PBM practices.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/health-care-stock-image-2048x1235.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 13:06:54.206980

India’s auto industry is staring at a fresh wave of disruption, with growth projections for 2025 now under threat due to China’s export curbs on rare earth magnets.

As on Jun 6, 2025 3:57 PM

According to Puneet Gupta, Director of India & ASEAN Auto Market at S&P Global Mobility, any production halts triggered by the restrictions could push the industry toward negative growth. “When 2025 began, OEMs were already expecting low single-digit growth. Now, any production halts could push the industry toward negative growth,” Gupta told CNBC-TV18.

He said the sector is facing yet another supply chain crisis, coming on the heels of the semiconductor shortage and pandemic-induced disruptions. “One thing is clear, the auto industry is facing yet another crisis,” he said, warning that while June may pass under stress, July could see production stoppages.

Gupta noted that large-volume OEMs like Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motors are particularly vulnerable to the latest disruption. These companies could face greater risks due to their scale of operations and reliance on timely delivery of critical components.

Inventory buffers with tier-2 suppliers may not offer much relief either. Gupta explained that while some suppliers hold three to six months of inventory, even a single supplier running low can create a bottleneck across the chain.

As for alternatives to sourcing from China, Gupta cautioned that the options are limited in the short term. “Right now, there’s a rush to procure even sub-assemblies from other countries if possible. But alternatives can’t be adopted immediately, they may reduce performance, and homologation is required before changing any components,” he said.

He called for swift diplomatic intervention and industry coordination to fast-track approvals and shipments from China.

The impact, he stressed, is not limited to electric vehicles. Even ICE two-wheelers and three-wheelers could be hit, as rare earth magnets are used in common components like speedometers, catalytic converters, and lighting systems. Gupta said, “It’s not just EVs, the impact spans across all vehicle segments.”

Higher-end variants of vehicles, which depend more heavily on sophisticated components using rare earth elements, could be affected first. OEMs may even consider shifting their focus to mid-range or base variants to manage the crisis.

Sub-assemblies from other markets might offer a short-term cushion, Gupta added, but the broader risk of disruption remains high until alternative supply chains are established or China’s restrictions are eased.

Women now run 11% of companies on the 2025 Fortune 500 list, the publication said this week.

The small gain came as six female CEOs either exited their roles or saw their company drop out of the ranking. Nine women CEOs joined the list when they were hired or their companies were elevated into the top 500 over the last year.

Despite the bigger number for 2025, “the pace of change remains stubbornly slow,” Jennifer McCollum, president and CEO of Catalyst, a workplace gender equity organization, told Fortune for a post on its website. “This minor uptick, while positive, is not a signal that we can ease off our efforts; if anything, it shows the deep-seated nature of the barriers that still exist.”

Among the departures, CVS Health in October 2024 parted ways with CEO Karen Lynch, who led the health care business for almost four years; CVS Health, ranked at No. 5 on the Fortune 500 in 2025 with $372.8 billion in revenue, was the largest company ever led by a female CEO. Lynch’s successor was David Joyner, who previously headed the company’s pharmacy benefits business.

Duke Energy’s CEO Lynn Good retired in April after more than 20 years at the company. Lori Ryerkerk and Barbara Rentler stepped down from Celanese and Ross Stores, respectively. CEO successors at all of those businesses were men.

Last month, Gina Boswell stepped down as CEO of Bath & Body Works—and the company didn’t make the Fortune 500 this year due to a drop in revenue. Neither did Clorox, which was ranked at No. 485 in 2024 and is still headed by Linda Rendle.

The nine who joined the list, the majority of whom were promoted from within their companies, include Kathleen Quirk, promoted to CEO from CFO at Freeport-McMoRan, Deanna Strable-Soethout, promoted from president at Principal Financial and Kecia Steelman, moving up from COO at Ulta Beauty.

J.B. Hunt Transport and U.S. Bancorp tapped their respective presidents Shelley Simpson and Gunjan Kedia as president and CEO. Marathon Petroleum named its executive vice president and CFO Maryann Mannen president and CEO, while Albertsons appointed executive vice president and chief operations officer Susan Morris to helm the company.

In November 2024, Marina Cheung became president and CEO of S&P Global, after serving as president of S&P Global Ratings.

The company already hauls freight for companies like Canadian Tire and has been in talks with several forestry companies to try and drum up more business.
Still, the forestry industry may not be immune to a growing backlash against autonomous trucks.
The Public and Private Workers of Canada, which represents some forestry workers, says it is closely monitoring the issue of self-driving trucks.
“Over the past several years, forestry workers—particularly in the pulp and paper sector—have faced tremendous uncertainty,” national president Geoff Dawe told The Logic.","Deep in the wilderness, where the roads are covered by evergreen needles, a semi truck cab carves a path through the snow, slowing as it approaches a one-lane bridge. The only warnings of the gully ahead are two black-and-orange striped signs. A wrong move and the truck careens into the gulch below.

The situation would be anxiety-inducing for a human, but this truck cab is driving itself. It’s using a system developed by NuPort Robotics, a Toronto-based autonomous-driving startup. Right now, it’s just a test run—but one day, Canada’s north could be criss-crossed with self-driving trucks hauling huge loads on dangerous roads.

These experiments are, in some ways, an industry’s attempt to outrun a crisis. Canada’s wood-product companies are among the first and hardest hit by issues like the climate crisis and trade wars, while recruitment challenges and gruelling logistics threaten one of the country’s most iconic industries.

“Just transporting that log is a challenge,” says David Elstone, a professional forester and managing director of the supply chain firm Spar Tree Group. The country’s vast terrain makes it hard to compete with the U.S., where transportation is much simpler, he said. “In the U.S. South, mills are quite centralized, and there’s ample amount of timber everywhere. It’s a huge cost disadvantage in Canada.”

It’s been a tough supply chain issue, as seasonal logging firms struggle to compete with oil and mining companies for trained drivers. In 2022, Alberta-based trucking and forestry companies said that they would have hired another 305 drivers that year but couldn’t find candidates, according to a government-funded survey by Trucking HR Canada. The shortfall caused the firms’ revenue to fall by about 15.4 per cent, on average, the survey found.

Still, those in the industry are split on whether the same artificial intelligence systems powering robotaxis in big cities are ready for the back roads of the Canadian wilderness. Here, distances are long, roads are unpaved and often steep, and turns can be precarious and slick. “On the B.C. coast, we have a lot of mountains, steep terrain, twisty switchbacks,” said Elstone.

It’s the type of challenge that could be a coup for people like NuPort Robotics CEO Raghavender Sahdev, as the tech industry strives to prove that AI can make a difference in the physical world. The company already hauls freight for companies like Canadian Tire and has been in talks with several forestry companies to try and drum up more business. They’re looking for help, he said, to relieve driver fatigue, determine which complicated maneuvers can be automated, and which, like strapping logs to trucks, must be done by humans. NuPort is also testing how the technology reacts to unexpected issues like a log falling into the road—not the type of thing that’s common on a regular highway.

While Sahdev would not reveal the location of the trials or which companies he’s in talks with, the project builds on years of research by companies like Chantiers Chibougamau, Resolute Forest Products, Interfor, West Fraser and Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries.

Those companies, as well as NuPort, have all been working on ways to automate trucking with FPInnovations, a research and development non-profit funded by both federal and provincial governments, as well as over 50 forest-product companies. Christoph Schilling, a manager of business development at FPInnovations, said the increasingly heavy payloads and niche applications make it hard to get the right products off the shelf.

Since Canada is the world’s most active trader of wood products, there are high stakes to get lumber from mill to market efficiently.

These days, that’s an ask as big as Paul Bunyan himself. While tariffs are a new word for many workers, trade duties go back decades in the softwood lumber industry, and have taken a turn for the worse. That’s after historic wildfires forced sawmills to close over the past few summers, a harbinger of the climate crisis challenges ahead. Meanwhile, supply chain disruptions, like rail stoppages, have hit the sector in 13 of the last 14 years.

Automation is one of the many tools that companies are hoping will help the industry keep up. West Fraser began running trials of autonomous forklifts at mills in 2019, while companies like Kodama can operate skidders remotely. T-Mar Industries, based in Campbell River, B.C., designs log yarders that can be operated by remote control.

Still, the forestry industry may not be immune to a growing backlash against autonomous trucks. Unions oppose plans to use the technology in the Prince Rupert port, where some timber lands before being shipped overseas.

The Public and Private Workers of Canada, which represents some forestry workers, says it is closely monitoring the issue of self-driving trucks. Despite the struggles reported by hiring managers, logging truck drivers say that they like their jobs, even with days starting as early as 1:30 a.m., a University of Washington study found. The study also found that neither inclement weather nor the time of day was correlated with severe truck crashes, perhaps owing, the researchers suggested, to the skill possessed by trained operators of such large vehicles.

“Over the past several years, forestry workers—particularly in the pulp and paper sector—have faced tremendous uncertainty.”

PPWC says that it recognizes the safety and efficiency that could come with automation; it also needs to protect jobs. “Over the past several years, forestry workers—particularly in the pulp and paper sector—have faced tremendous uncertainty,” national president Geoff Dawe told The Logic. “We’ve seen multiple sawmill and pulp mill closures across British Columbia, with devastating ripple effects on workers, families, and rural communities.”

Schilling of FPInnovations said that their project is far from mass deployment, but is being received well in early discussions with workers. Elstone, from the supply chain firm, acknowledged the tension in an industry that faces such wild conditions that it swings from labour shortages to job losses.

“There has been a perennial skilled labour shortage, a critical skill labour shortage facing the B.C. logging industry for a number of years,” he said. “The only offset to the issue in British Columbia is the fact that we have a shrinking industry. Not the best way to find relief for your skilled labour shortage.”

Gord Magill, a trucker from Hamilton with experience in the logging industry, has been a vocal skeptic, calling automation a “relentless push to make truckers extinct.” In particular, he worries that drivers could actually be in more danger if their focus is encouraged to wander from the road as technology takes over.

Unlike highway driving, logging roads are often unmarked and unpredictable, and drivers have to exit the cab and adjust when loads shift during transit. He’s skeptical of claims that the technology is focused on protecting truckers’ safety, rather than just saving companies money by cutting staff.

“People should understand that trucking is way more than driving,” Magill said. “The claims of the autonomous truck makers, some of them are true, and some of them are fantasy, and some of them are omitting a lot of the complexities about the job.”

Magill is particularly puzzled by technologies like truck platooning, which involves programming a convoy of trucks to follow a lead human driver from harvesting sites to sawmills, sometimes in off-road conditions.

FPInnovations has been testing the technology on Billy-Diamond Road near Matagami, Que., a project it said has been paving the way for the autonomous driving trials going on today. California-based Kratos, a defence and security company, and Maryland-based autonomous vehicle startup Forterra both recently wrapped up a platooning trial hauling timber a few hours north of Montreal, near Resolute sawmills. Both companies said limited internet connectivity, dusty roads and unexpected appearances from wildlife, like a Canada lynx, required creative combinations of sensors beyond the traditional cameras or Lidars used by robotaxis.

Magill, the trucker, said his position is still evolving, but he isn’t sure such technology will be more useful than analog alternatives like road trains, where multiple trailers are hitched to one truck.

Snowflake Acquisition Expands Postgres Capabilities Of Its AI Data Cloud

Snowflake tops this week’s Came to Win list with its acquisition of Crunchy Data, a provider of open-source PostgresSQL technology, products and support services, in a bold move to expand the Postgre database services of its AI Data Cloud platform.

With the acquisition, Snowflake will offer Snowflake Postgres, an “AI-ready, enterprise-grade and developer-friendly” PostgreSQL database on the company’s AI Data Cloud, Snowflake said in an announcement on the eve of the company’s Snowflake Summit 2025 annual conference in San Francisco.

PostgreSQL is a popular open-source database for developing and running data-intensive, enterprise-scale applications and, more recently, AI applications and AI agents.

Snowflake Postgres will provide developers with the full capabilities of the PostgreSQL database combined with the governance, security and operational standards needed for building and running mission-critical AI applications, according to the company.

The acquisition news came on the eve of Snowflake Summit 2025, the company’s annual conference being held this week in San Francisco.

“We’re tackling a massive $350 billion market opportunity and a real need for our customers to bring Postgres to the Snowflake AI Data Cloud,” said Vivek Raghunathan, Snowflake senior vice president of engineering, in a statement.

NWN Acquires AWS Superstar InterVision To Fuel AI-Powered Managed Services Acceleration

Speaking of strategic acquisitions, solution provider NWN this week made its biggest move yet to dominate the AI-powered managed services era by acquiring AWS AI partner InterVision Systems, a leader in AI customer experience solutions.

The acquisition accelerates NWN’s rapid ascent in AI. InterVision is an AI customer experience leader which last year received the top prize in the inaugural AWS GenAI Builder Bonanza contest.

“InterVision has been a market leader in delivering cloud customer experience solutions with AWS Connect and other AI cloud solutions,” NWN CEO Jim Sullivan said in an interview with CRN. “The capabilities that we are getting to accelerate what we have already built is a great game changer for us.”

The deal builds on NWN’s own innovative intelligent virtual agent AI customer experience and device-as-a-service offerings.

The acquisition brings extensive AI cloud customer experience capabilities in AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud to NWN and provides the company with the ability to offer a full suite of GenAI-powered managed services with intelligent virtual agents from the desktop with device-as-a-service, to the data center, to the cloud.

Workday Looks To Expand Its AI Agent Partner Ecosystem With New Program

Agentic AI is hot. So HR and finance cloud application giant Workday wins applause this week for launching a new partner program that encompasses the company’s ecosystem of technology and channel partners who are building AI agents that connect with Workday’s Agent System of Record platform.

The new Agent Partner Network marks Workday’s latest expansion of its channel efforts. One year ago the application company launched Built on Workday, a program to recruit and assist ISV and development partners who build applications and software add-ons and extensions that run on the Workday platform and sell them through the Workday Marketplace.

Workday, which held its Workday DevCon 2025 event in Las Vegas this week, also unveiled Agent Gateway, new agent-to-agent technology that customers use to connect and manage AI agents from Workday and partners joining the Agent Partner Network.

While the Workday Agent Partner Network is under the broader Workday partner program umbrella, Matt Brandt, Workday senior vice president of global partners, told CRN that the initiative recognizes that partners developing AI agents have unique technology and support needs. The new Agent Gateway is a key component and agent developers can offer their products on the Workday Marketplace.

“Our customers know that [AI] agents are going to be an important part of the future and we want to give them a responsible and trusted way to manage all that,” Brandt said. “I think a lot of customers now don’t really know what’s happening and what’s going to happen in the agentic world.”

(And in this busy week, an extra shoutout to data management startup Diliko for launching its inaugural partner program to recruit systems integrators, analytics service providers and data management consulting firms to work with the company’s agentic AI data management and optimization platform that launched in November.)

Ciroos.AI Emerges From Stealth, Raises $21M To Scale Agentic AI Tool For Operations Teams

Did we mention that Agentic AI is hot? AI startup Ciroos.AI emerged from stealth mode this week with ambitious plans to help enterprises find and resolve application issues across multiple domains with its extensible, AI-powered site reliability engineering (SRE) assistant.

Ciroos.AI also announced that it raised $21 million in a funding round led by Energy Impact Partners, which will go towards growing the business, recruiting talent, and driving customer adoption of the company’s AI SRE Teammate, Ciroos’ Co-founder and CEO Ronak Desai told CRN.

Ciroos’ AI SRE Teammate lets overwhelmed site reliability engineers, DevOps and operations teams automate, augment and drive autonomous operations to cut incident response time by 90 percent, or hours to minutes, Desai said.

AI SRE Teammate, which uses a multi-agent system, will help enterprises initiate investigations into anomalies proactively, often before any administrator is aware of an issue. The tool employs “human expert-like reasoning” to understand and correlate large amounts of cross-domain interactions and data to identify problems, the company said.

AMD’s Acquisition Spree To Battle Nvidia Continues With Brium Buy

Returning to the subject of strategic acquisitions, chip designer AMD this week continued its acquisition spree to challenge Nvidia’s AI computing dominance with the purchase of a startup that specializes in AI software optimization.

On Wednesday AMD announced that it had acquired Brium, which AMD said is made up of “world-class compiler and AI software experts with deep expertise in machine learning, AI inference and performance optimization.”

Anush Elangovan, AMD corporate vice president of software development, said Brium’s advanced software capabilities will “strengthen our ability to deliver highly optimized AI solutions,” including AMD’s Instinct GPUs that have been key to its competitive fight with Nvidia.

“Their work in compiler technology, model execution frameworks and end-to-end AI inference optimization will play a key role in enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of our AI platform,” Elangovan wrote in a blog post.

The major advantage AMD sees with Brium is the startup’s “ability to optimize the entire inference stack before the model reaches the hardware,” according to Elangovan.

The Brium acquisition will also help “accelerate the open-source tools” underlying AMD’s AI software stack and advance its mission to support the specialized needs of customers in verticals ranging from health care and life sciences to finance and manufacturing.",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/media_15a2229b4adcebabe2f2983c4961f1f2089172273.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-06-06 15:08:43.079557

The redeployment of capital into higher-growth businesses and markets through improving efficiency is a multifaceted approach to boosting profitability.","Barclays PLC BCS has been taking steps to divest unprofitable/less profitable operations and save expenses through business streamlining, while deploying the capital into higher revenue-generating areas.

In February, Barclays sold its consumer finance business in Germany. Last year, the company transformed its operating divisions and divested its Italian mortgage portfolio and $1.1 billion in credit card receivables.

Through these efforts, Barclays recorded gross savings of £1 billion in 2024 and £150 million in the first quarter of 2025. The company targets to achieve gross efficiency savings of £0.5 billion this year. By 2026, management expects total gross efficiency savings to be £2 billion and the cost-to-income ratio to be in the high 50s. Its first-quarter 2025 cost-to-income ratio was 57%.

The company is deploying these savings in high-growth businesses and markets. This April, Barclays entered into a partnership with Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. to transform its payment acceptance business with plans to inject roughly £400 million. In March, the bank had announced a capital injection of more than INR2,300 crore (£210 million) into its India operations, following an injection of almost INR3,000 crore (£300 million) in 2021. Last year, the company acquired Tesco’s retail banking business, which complements its existing business. In 2023, Barclays acquired Kensington Mortgage, which bolstered its mortgage business.

The redeployment of capital into higher-growth businesses and markets through improving efficiency is a multifaceted approach to boosting profitability. Barclays remains committed to this approach, which is likely to help improve profitability over time.

“From a top-down view, what lies ahead for Indian advertising is not just growth, but leadership.
That's the scary reality of network consolidation – not just today but for decades.
AI is a strong reason for this reality and for network consolidation.
It was good to see nearly all key agencies participate, and in fact to see more agencies – both network agencies and independents – do better than in past editions.","Several key themes dominated the event. Although the ongoing wave of network consolidations surfaced mostly in muted conversations, official discussions were largely taken over by one dominant topic: the growing impact of artificial intelligence on the advertising and marketing landscape.

AI is now arguably the most prolific force shaping the industry. Speaking at the inaugural session, Rishad Tobaccowala, author and senior advisor to Publicis Groupe, remarked: “AI will be like electricity – essential but not a differentiator – and true advantage will come from HI (human ingenuity).” He called for an upgrade to our “mental operating system”, just as we regularly update our phones. “The future,” he noted, “does not fit in the containers of the past.”

The Drum spoke to a group of advertising leaders on the sidelines of Goafest to better understand what lies ahead as agencies grapple with technological disruption and structural transformation.

Jitender Dabas, CEO, Cheil X (part of Cheil SWA)

“These are defining times for the advertising industry as we’ve known it, and for agencies as we’ve known them.

“Whenever technology collides with the core of any industry, it leads to seismic shifts in economics – and therefore structures. What’s in store for Indian advertising isn’t very different from what’s happening globally. There will be a power shift on the other side of the AI-led disruption. If knowledge and craft become free, then what will we charge for? That’s something we need to ponder.

“The consolidation moves are, at best, protective – geared more to please shareholders than to transform the industry.

“One thing is certain – agencies still defining their value at the top end of the funnel will have to make way for those with ecosystems that partner clients throughout the journey. That’s where clients are seeing more value now. Meanwhile, platforms and publishers continue to command both power and revenue.

“My thought: by the next Goafest, things could look very different.”

Rana Barua, group CEO, Havas India, South East & North Asia (Japan & South Korea)

“The festival closed with a powerful reminder of India’s momentum: the news that we are now the fourth-largest economy in the world. The action is here. The ambition is here. And most importantly, the future is being shaped here.

“From a top-down view, what lies ahead for Indian advertising is not just growth, but leadership. I genuinely believe that Indian advertising is heading for the most defining decade, as we will be building the brands that will take India forward.”

Raj Kamble, founder and CCO, Famous Innovations

“For many, when they go to bed, they work for one agency. When they wake up, they work for another. And they find out in the news. That's the scary reality of network consolidation – not just today but for decades.

“Indian advertising is entering a decisive transition. The top-down view reveals a dual pressure: network consolidation is shrinking the playground for creative autonomy, while AI is rapidly redrawing the lines of production and ideation.

“There’s a huge recession predicted in the US, but people are not talking about it. In New York, for example, they are allowing weed stores on every corner to generate income for the city. The crime rate is so high that today, if you’re dealing with a theft of less than 1,000 USD, you can’t even file a police complaint. AI is a strong reason for this reality and for network consolidation. It hasn’t hit India in its full force yet.

“The sun will set on the old school of advertising amidst this reinvention, and the next big AI and tech-friendly generation will take over the advertising agency.

“There are 600 million people under 35 in India, and they’re not choosing the traditional arts, commerce, or science. They are going towards creativity, tech and new media. So that wave will hit our industry soon. India just has to wait a few years.

“I always believed in human intelligence and laughed at the word ‘artificial’ intelligence, but today AI is having me eat my words.”

Ashish Khazanchi, managing partner, Enormous

“After three days of sharp conversations, rain-soaked nostalgia and flashes of future-facing thinking, one walks away sensing that Indian advertising is at an inflection point.

“The consolidation at the network level feels less like a threat and more like a clearing of the playing field – making space for sharper, faster, more entrepreneurial creative engines.

“At the same time, AI is no longer just a buzzword; it’s a co-creator, pushing us to rethink the very craft of storytelling. But the core remains unchanged – our ability to connect emotionally, culturally and meaningfully. The ones who will win are those who marry tech with simple human truths, scale with soul, and a deep understanding of the Indian heartbeat.”

Dheeraj Sinha, group CEO – India and South Asia, FCB (part of IPG)

“This year’s Goafest was more about the spirit of returning to Goa to celebrate the industry and the work. It reminded us that beyond the awards, this festival is about the industry coming together. Each element – from knowledge sessions and masterclasses to networking and celebrations – shapes the industry’s collective energy.

“Notable sessions included Rishad Tobaccowala’s talk on staying relevant in an age of machines, and a fireside chat with Luke Coutinho on holistic nutrition and well-being. Over the last few years, we’ve consciously expanded the agenda to include sessions catering to personal and professional development.

“Masterclasses led by D&AD, Google and Meta brought practical skills and future-facing thinking to the fore. Together, these moments reaffirmed Goafest’s role as a space for reflection, learning and collective growth.

“AI is becoming integral to our day-to-day workflows – powering everything from storyboarding and task management to content creation, personalisation, targeting, ad delivery optimisation and performance analysis. It frees us from the mundane and sharpens our focus on creativity and strategic outcomes.

“The future will demand more agile, collaborative and outcome-driven workflows. We shall witness greater investment in talent that can bridge technology and creativity, and a growing appetite for ideas that win awards and solve real problems.”

Amitesh Rao, CEO – South Asia, Leo (Publicis Groupe)

“Goafest 2025 turned out to be a strong marker of a healthy advertising industry in India, in more ways than one. It was good to see nearly all key agencies participate, and in fact to see more agencies – both network agencies and independents – do better than in past editions.

“Both the quality and quantity of entries were better than before, and the fact that a wide body of work across brands did well was an excellent sign.

“More importantly, the formal and informal conversations across Goafest were dominated by the transformation that the industry is going through – not just in terms of consolidations, but in terms of capabilities, talent, technologies and business models. These are signs of an industry that is walking the talk – something that is very welcome.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/news/356152/goafest1.jpg?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-06-06 12:18:27.040489

Best Buy initiated a major restructuring effort within its health business in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, incurring $109 million in restructuring charges.
“The strategy of the health business is enabling care at home for everyone,” said CEO Corie Barry, on a recent call to discuss the company’s earnings.

“I think all of us would agree, we absolutely see a future where more of your health care is taken into your own hands using technology and technology devices,” she said.","MINNEAPOLIS – Best Buy remains committed to its health business, but parts of it are taking longer to scale than expected, company execs say.

Best Buy initiated a major restructuring effort within its health business in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, incurring $109 million in restructuring charges.

“The strategy of the health business is enabling care at home for everyone,” said CEO Corie Barry, on a recent call to discuss the company’s earnings. “As you think about the business – we have active aging or our Lively business or even just some of the care-at-home business – these remain very viable business models for the future.”

Best Buy’s early moves into health care include its 2018 acquisition of Great Call, a provider of connected health and personal emergency response services to the aging population, and its 2021 acquisition of Current Health, a health care technology platform.

That was followed by several partnerships with leading health systems such as Mass General Brigham, Geisinger and Atrium Health to offer in-home care and remote monitoring to patients with chronic health conditions.

But those partnerships have been slower to scale, say execs, amid uncertainty about how long hospital-at-home waivers will remain in place. First begun by CMS in November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the waivers have been extended several times, most recently through September 2025.

“The adoption of hospital-at-home solutions at scale (is) slower because, partially, the health-at-home waiver has been caught up in a lot of the administration's budgeting conversations, and it's been inconsistent in terms of how long that waiver will be in place,” said Barry.

Growth has also been slowed by financial struggles for other health care providers over the past few years, said Barry.

“I think all of us would agree, we absolutely see a future where more of your health care is taken into your own hands using technology and technology devices,” she said. “You can already see it across our assortment and across how people are choosing to take care of their own health, and we will continue to lean into that part of the strategy.”",https://www.hmenews.com/uploads/blog/a587d9f2d2eb087c0621a580d1e99eb4.gif,N,,2025-06-06 12:16:34.936674

Cox and his co-conspirators misled seniors into providing personal information through deceptive advertising and offshore call centers, then used DMERx—a digital platform—to create fraudulent prescriptions. These orders were exchanged for illegal kickbacks from pharmacies, DME suppliers and telemedicine providers. The fraudulent prescriptions falsely claimed doctors had examined patients, when in reality, physicians were paid to approve orders without proper evaluation. Cox and his team hid the scheme using sham contracts and doctored language to avoid scrutiny. Medicare and other insurers paid more than $360 million based on these fraudulent claims. “The defendant orchestrated a scheme to defraud government health care benefit programs on a massive scale, creating fraudulent doctors’ orders used to bill insurers over $1 billion,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Americans are all too familiar with junk mail and spam calls that target seniors to steal their personal information and promote waste, fraud, and abuse in our economy.” Cox was convicted on multiple charges, including conspiracy to commit health care fraud, wire fraud, and receiving kickbacks. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the most serious charge, with sentencing scheduled at a later date.

Australia’s regulatory authority sues Philips over CPAP devices

CANBERRA, Australia – The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia's regulatory authority for therapeutic goods, has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against Philips Electronics Australia Limited (PEAL) for the alleged unlawful supply of medical devices that did not meet Australian safety and performance requirements. These included devices used by people at home who suffer from sleep apnea and devices used by patients who need help breathing. The devices, which were recalled in 2021, contained a polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) foam used for noise suppression that had a real risk of degrading, allowing particulates to be inhaled or ingested by the patient, TGA says. Potential harm from short and intermediate exposure included skin, eye and respiratory tract irritation, inflammatory response, headache, asthma, effects on the user’s reproductive system and neoplasia, it says. Potential harm from long-term exposure included cytotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects, it says. TGA alleges that, due to the risk of the PE-PUR foam degrading, the devices supplied from June 2, 2019, to Oct. 13, 2022, were unsafe, did not perform as intended and were therefore unlawfully supplied. TGA alleges that there were more than 44,000 separate instances of unlawful supply of devices in that period.

CMS awards RAC contracts to Cotiviti

WASHINGTON – CMS in April named Cotiviti GOV Services the new Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) for Region 3, 4 and 5.

CHcc launches tools to promote hospital-at-home programs

BOSTON – The Connected Health Collaborative Community (CHcc), which is co-hosted by the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe) and the Consume Technology Association, has launched its inaugural open-source resources to help scale hospital-at-home (HaH) programs to equip stakeholders with free tools to transition HaH from a temporary policy initiative to a permanent, sustainable model of care. Resources include:

A patient journey map

Technical and operational considerations

Program evaluation and reimbursement pathways, and

Pillars of successful implementation

“At a time when government funding for health care is being reduced, hospital-at-home programs offer a lifeline to maintain access to essential services,” said Benjamin Vandendriessche, chief delivery officer, DiMe. “By delivering high-quality care in the home at a fraction of the cost of traditional hospital stays, these programs help health systems preserve critical services. Hospital-at-home is not just a cost-saving measure, it’s a sustainable model that protects patient care, supports frontline staff, and ensures communities continue to receive the care they need, even in a time of economic and policy uncertainty.” CHcc counts UMass Chan Medical School’s Program in Digital Medicine as founding Impact Sponsor.",https://www.hmenews.com/images/og-default-image.png,N,,2025-06-06 12:18:23.213945

Zacks Investment Research The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Innovation lies at the heart of Nomad Foods Limited’s NOMD management strategy, driving long-term growth and competitive advantage. In the first quarter of 2025, despite retailer inventory destocking and modest sales, NOMD grew its gross margin by 90 basis points year over year to 27.8%. While this growth was driven by supply-chain productivity gains and favorable year-over-year inventory effects, it reflects NOMD’s broader strategy of pairing operational efficiency with long-term innovation in high-margin categories like fish.

The relaunch of sub-brands like Fish Bar in Italy, featuring snack-sized fish fingers for younger and higher-income consumers, showcases how the company uses innovation to unlock new occasions and drive category penetration. Early results are compelling, the company’s retail sales of fish products in Italy rose 9% year over year in the first quarter. Additionally, the new Captain’s Discoveries line in the United Kingdom aims to spice up traditional frozen meals with modern flavors, appealing to evolving consumer palates. As a result, innovation is on track to increase as a percentage of sales again in 2025, reinforcing NOMD’s ability to support margins even as input costs tick up.

Rather than cutting investments, Nomad is doubling down on advertising and product upgrades. NOMD is confident that its innovation-led flywheel can keep gross margins resilient. The company’s execution in transforming traditional frozen fish into an exciting, modern meal option is evidence that its innovation pipeline is not only working, but helping buffer margin pressures.

How Are NOMD Rivals CAG & KHC Approaching?

While NOMD sharpens its margin edge through targeted innovation in frozen meals and fish, Conagra Brands CAG and The Kraft Heinz Company KHC are intensifying their own innovation strategies to stay competitive.

Conagra continues to modernize its portfolio. Recently acquired FATTY Smoked Meat Sticks is enhancing its leading position in the high-growth, high-margin meat stick category. Conagra also focuses on aligning its frozen and snacks offerings with evolving consumer needs, emphasizing convenience and flavor.

Kraft Heinz is leveraging global trends by expanding bold flavor profiles across sauces and launching wellness-centric products like Mio & Wine, a zero-sugar hydration brand. Kraft Heinz's innovation strategy is broad, spanning global flavor fusion, ready meals and functional beverages.

UFCW Local 367 represents grocery and retail workers in South Puget Sound and Southwest Washington; the proposed strike could affect 37 stores and nearly 4,500 Local 367 workers.
The union represents thousands of workers at Fred Meyer, QFC, Albertsons, Safeway, Haggen and Saars in Washington state.
Is that too much to ask?” Media representatives for Albertsons/Safeway did not respond to an emailed request for comment Thursday.
Fred Meyer, in a statement Thursday evening sent through its media representative, said that “The allegation put forward by UFCW Local 367 of an unfair labor practice is unfounded.","Pierce County and area grocery workers represented by UFCW 367 have voted to authorize an Unfair Labor Practice strike against Kroger brands Fred Meyer and QFC, as well as Albertsons and Safeway.

In a release issued Thursday evening, the union said the action “comes in direct response to the companies’ unfair labor practices triggered by their failure to provide crucial information to union negotiators, and limiting workers’ concerted activity in front of some stores.”

It added that “Workers are calling for compliance with labor laws, fair treatment, and respect as they negotiate a new three-year labor agreement.”

Alongside the local action, tens of thousands of grocery workers represented by UFCW in Southern California, Colorado and Seattle also were voting on strike authorizations.

UFCW Local 367 represents grocery and retail workers in South Puget Sound and Southwest Washington; the proposed strike could affect 37 stores and nearly 4,500 Local 367 workers.

UFCW 3000 union members also voted to reject their employers’ latest contract. The union represents thousands of workers at Fred Meyer, QFC, Albertsons, Safeway, Haggen and Saars in Washington state.

In a release, Fred Meyer and QFC corporate officials said that while they acknowledged the outcome of the unions’ strike authorization votes, it sought to emphasize that the “procedural step does not mean a strike is inevitable,” and stores remain open.

The companies said they remained committed to reaching an agreement “that rewards associates by improving wages and keeping groceries affordable for customers.”

“A strike at this stage is an unnecessary and disruptive action—especially given the meaningful wage increases and industry-leading healthcare we’re offering at the bargaining table,” Todd Kammeyer, president of Fred Meyer, said in a statement. “We remain committed to continuing negotiations in good faith and urge union leadership to do the same.”

Joann Gardner, an Albertsons employee represented by Local 367, said in a statement that “My co-workers and I are committed to holding these companies accountable to bargain in good faith. All we’re asking for is the information we need to negotiate honestly and the freedom to inform the public about our needs. Is that too much to ask?”

Media representatives for Albertsons/Safeway did not respond to an emailed request for comment Thursday.

Fred Meyer, in a statement Thursday evening sent through its media representative, said that “The allegation put forward by UFCW Local 367 of an unfair labor practice is unfounded. We remain actively engaged in good faith bargaining with UFCW 367 because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption.”

It added that “Our current offer reflects that commitment, including up to 8.28% wage increases for top-rate associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.”

According to the UFCW 367’s website, the workers seek wages and raises that keep pace with cost of living and consistent scheduling that gives workers the hours they need to qualify for healthcare. They also seek improvements to address understaffing, enforcement of safety protocols and “ensuring management takes action to protect workers and customers alike.”

No strike date has been set.

Quarterly PC Sales Lenovo: $11.8 billion, up 12.9 percent year over year HP: $9.02 billion, up 7 percent year over year Dell: $12.5 billion, up 5 percent year over year Dell saw its PC sales grow five percent, year over year on sales of $12.5 billion.
On the consumer side, however, Dell’s PC sales plummeted 19 percent year over year, dropping from $1.81 billion to $1.46 billion.
HP saw overall PC sales in the quarter grow to $9.0 billion or seven percent year over year.
PC Market Share (Jan 1.","The three biggest PC makers announced quarterly earnings at the end of May, giving analysts a peek inside the Windows end-of-life-driven product refresh that is projected to replace the devices bought during the pandemic-led PC boom.

While the refresh is arriving, it isn’t yet a tide lifting all boats as commercial buyers are ahead of consumers, said HP CEO Enrique Lores during the company’s May 28 second quarter earnings call.

“In personal systems, revenue grew eight percent in constant currency above our expectations driven by strong commercial performance,” he said. “As expected, we saw continued strength in AI PC demand and the Windows 11 refresh and we believe that momentum will carry forward. We drove share gains year over year, in commercial PCs particularly in premium, workstation, AI PC and gaming.”

Dell – which has been projecting a PC refresh since June 2023 – said its arrival is still “behind prior cycles,” but is expected to come in the coming quarters.

“While the PC refresh remains behind prior cycles, we are seeing indicators that the installed base is upgrading to new Windows 11 PCs, many of them AI PCs,” Dell COO Jeff Clarke said. “The consumer market remains challenged. Consumer revenue declined 19 percent. And the industry pricing remained competitive.”

Lenovo’s Intelligent Device Group – which includes PCs, tablets and smartphones– saw its sales grow 13 percent. The company said that increase was driven by the sale of premium PCs. Following its May 22 earnings, Ryan McCurdy, who’s in charge of North American sales for Lenovo, told CRN the refresh is coming in now and it’s going to continue well past the Windows 11 refresh date.

“The installed base is enormous. We have hundreds of millions globally ready to refresh, and so that is still the opportunity,” he said during a video call. “Has it pushed to the right? Yes, but October is the date. And I do not think October is the end. I think there is already see some momentum in the business today.”

In terms of overall PC sales worldwide, Needham, Mass.-based industry tracker IDC ranks Lenovo first with a 24.5 percent market share. HP Inc. comes in second with 19.9 percent share and Dell ranks third with 14.4 percent.

IDC said last month that it projected the PC market will grow four percent this year, led by the Window’s 11 device migration and in spite of tariffs: “After recording strong results in the first quarter of 2025, IDC is increasing its traditional PC forecast for 2025 — this comes despite the significant impact that US tariffs have had on its trading partners’ market sentiment. Global PC volume is now expected to reach 274 million in 2025, growing +4.1% over the prior year.”

The analysts predict those sales could cool in coming quarters.

“Beyond 2025, IDC forecasts a slight contraction in 2026 due in part from volume stabilization following Windows 11 migration and to a more difficult comparison given a stronger market in 2025,” the company predicts.

Here’s how the three vendors stack up in terms of PC revenue, total sales and market share as well as earnings per share and projected PC growth.

Quarterly PC Sales

Lenovo: $11.8 billion, up 12.9 percent year over year

HP: $9.02 billion, up 7 percent year over year

Dell: $12.5 billion, up 5 percent year over year

Dell saw its PC sales grow five percent, year over year on sales of $12.5 billion. That growth was driven by its commercial business, which rose nearly 9 percent, from $10.1 billion in the year ago quarter to $11.04 billion this year. On the consumer side, however, Dell’s PC sales plummeted 19 percent year over year, dropping from $1.81 billion to $1.46 billion.

Lenovo’s PC division — the Intelligent Devices Group, which includes smartphones and tablets — grew nearly 13 percent year over year on sales of $11.8 billion. That segment further enlarged its PC market leadership and expanded the gap to the number two player year-on-year by a further point, the company said.

HP saw overall PC sales in the quarter grow to $9.0 billion or seven percent year over year. The surge was driven by commercial sales, which rose to $6.75 billion, up 10 percent in that time frame, while consumer sales came in at about $2.25 billion, down 7 percent.

PC Market Share (Jan 1. To March 31)

Lenovo: 24.1 percent

HP: 20.2 percent

Dell: 15.1 percent

According to Needham, Mass.-based industry tracker IDC, as a whole PC makers increased their global shipments during the first quarter by 4.9 percent, with a total of 63.2 million devices.

“In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year,” Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, said in a statement. ""Evidently, commercial demand remained strong in the first quarter, but the new round of US tariffs announced on April 2nd could have a direct inflationary impact on the PC market that could result in delayed IT spending for the remainder of the year”

From January 1 to March 31, Lenovo dominated the category – which includes workstations, notebooks and desktops – with 15.2 million units shipped, reaching a 24.1 percent share of the market, according to IDC numbers released April 8.

HP Inc. shipped 12.7 million devices, holding on to the number two spot with a 20.2 percent share.

Dell Technologies meanwhile sent 9.5 million PCs into the market to claim third place with a 15.1 percent share overall.",https://www.crn.com/news/computing/2025/media_1e2a2e24da50c5355e0d2bea93365ab7b9a4d4c66.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-06-06 12:17:11.372332

Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at the research firm, issued the warning during a presentation at WardAuto’s AutoTech 2025, calling the tariffs a serious blow to U.S. competitiveness in the global auto market, particularly in the electric vehicle sector.

“We are shooting ourselves in the foot… with respect to having to deal with these short-term issues and navigate them,” Robinet said, referring to the unpredictable pace of new tariffs. He noted that Chinese automakers, who already hold an advantage in the EV race, are continuing to gain ground without facing similar trade policy instability.

S&P Global, which provides economic forecasting to the auto industry, has been forced to update its guidance weekly to keep up with shifting White House trade decisions. These changes include the recent doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%, adding further cost pressure on automakers already managing supply chain realignments and EV production targets.

The Trump administration’s 25% tariff on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico has prompted some manufacturers to consider relocating production to the United States. However, Robinet cautioned that such moves are far from simple, especially on the short timelines being imposed. He added that Asian automakers such as Toyota, Honda and Hyundai have little to no excess production capacity in the U.S., leaving only Nissan with significant unused factory space—though demand for Nissan vehicles lags behind its competitors.

Battery-electric vehicle makers face an additional layer of uncertainty. China controls 90% of the rare-earth metals needed for EV batteries and motors, making ongoing trade tensions especially risky for U.S. and European manufacturers.

Robinet said many automakers are fast-tracking production and consumers are accelerating purchases to stay ahead of expected price increases and possible rollbacks of federal EV tax incentives.

Forecasting challenges are compounded by broader economic concerns. “We are still convinced that inflation is going to rear its ugly head,” Robinet said, citing the impact of tariffs on interest rates, unemployment and GDP.

One of the biggest regulatory blind spots, according to Robinet, is that automakers have never been required to track value-added content on vehicles built in North America, making it difficult to apply new tariff rules retroactively.

Robinet said many automakers are delaying investment and production decisions due to the uncertainty.

Medtronic is recalling certain tracheostomy tubes because of the risk that the devices could dislodge, causing an emergency where the patient cannot breathe or their airway is blocked, according to a Thursday Class I recall notice from the Food and Drug Administration.

The company sent a notice to customers on Feb. 26 asking them to quarantine and return all unused tubes from the affected lot. The recall applies to the Shiley adult flexible tracheostomy tube with taperguard cuff reusable inner cannula.

Medtronic began the recall after receiving reports from customers that the flange used to secure the device may become disconnected. Patient harm was reported in some cases, but no deaths have been reported to date, a company spokesperson wrote in an email Thursday.

Dive Insight:

Medtronic’s tracheostomy tubes are used to help patients breathe. They can also be used during a procedure to create an opening in the neck to place the tube. For the recalled devices, the securement flange may become disconnected, which can cause the tube to become dislodged and affect a patient’s breathing.

Using a device that has a disconnected flange can cause respiratory failure, airway tissue injury, choking, respiratory tract infection, tightening of the airways, treatment delay or death, according to the FDA notice.

For patients with affected devices already in place, a replacement is required, according to a March 25 entry in the FDA’s recall database. The product removal applies to 780 devices distributed outside of the U.S. in countries including France, Germany, South Africa, Spain and Taiwan, according to the entry.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IJXbvLTCEB04c1n9ojQGjUZNnkECCMTDqEeEHL18qQw/g:nowe:0:29/c:1000:564/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9NZWR0cm9uaWMuNC4yNi4yNC43XzEwMDAuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-06 12:18:12.997165

It made me feel less guilty about eating fast food and honestly, they were pretty tasty. Apparently, I’m not alone in that thinking.

In a raw and stripped back post on X, McDonald’s announced the return of the Snack Wrap, coming July 10.

The message begins, “i don’t usually do this, and i didn’t run this by brian from legal (sorry brian). but i have something to say. not as mcdonald’s but as the person behind the mcdonald’s account.”

Already hooked.

It continues:

“yes, i could post about the Snack Wrap, tease you with tweets like “bring back ___” (knowing exactly what you’d say), and even manifest for its return. but i couldn’t bring it back. you know who could bring it back? YOU. YOU commented under every post. YOU made petitions.

“YOU asked for it back in the DRIVE THRU!? YOU tweeted every day for 100 days straight. YOU rallied. you organized. and i saw it all. thanks to you, the Snack Wrap will be back. i cheered you on from behind the screen and made it my mission to never stop fighting for you. i made 486 decks on “reasons why to bring back the Snack Wrap” (i counted). your endless comments, tweets, and posts were the fuel i needed to keep on going.”

The post went live on Thursday. As of this morning, it has 16.5 million views.

Why it matters: Right from the start, this post gets you. It has the feel of an account takeover instead of a carefully curated PR campaign. It diverts from the witty, dressed up McDonald’s announcements we know and recognize – and often love.

Suddenly, it’s not the brand consumers see. It’s a person. A human. And what a time to be human amid so much tech talk. This is smart and it connects consumers to the message. It’s simple and to the point.

McDonald’s Director of Social Media and Influencer Amanda Mulligan said it best in a LinkedIn post following the announcement: “Brands build bold, unhinged personas to entertain and stand out. That works until the moment comes when you want to speak sincerely, and you realize how hard it is to shift gears.

“We debated whether we should do it this way. Whether we should shorten it. Whether we should be this vulnerable. And we debated whether anyone would even care.”

This is a scenario that really worked. And as it turned out, millions of people cared.

Editor’s Top Picks:

Barkbox CEO Matt Meeker apologized to consumers via Instagram after an internal message from Slack was leaked saying that it was not a great idea to market some of its Pride merchandise. The Wall Street Journal reports that the message said, “pushing this promo risks unintentionally sending the message that ‘we’re not for you’ to a large portion of our audience.” As Pride month gets underway, this has been a dilemma for large brands in the midst of a tricky political climate. Meeker addressed the message saying, “I apologize. A few days ago, an internal message from a BARK team member was released on social media. The message was disrespectful and hurtful to the LGBTQIA+ community, and as the CEO of BARK, I’m responsible for that.” He went on to say he doesn’t agree with the message and he’s “deeply sorry it happened” adding a link to the brand’s Pride merchandise. This is the best way to address PR snafus. Be honest. Be to-the-point. Be sincere. Meeker’s message comes across as sincere and he doesn’t try to backtrack or place blame on anyone else. There will still be some damage, and the brand may take a hit, but he got the message out swiftly and tried to make amends for the incident.

There was a time when “Stanley Cup” meant hockey. And then Stanley 1913 tumblers went viral in the fashion of Rae Dunn dishware a few years back – and pshh, forget about hockey. While the brand has been around since 1913, its moment was heightened this past year by the craze for the cups. But brands have to think in longer terms to stay relevant. “We so outperformed on what the original vision was,” Kate Ridley, Stanley 1913’s chief brand officer said to the WSJ, “and what got us to that moment today is not what we need for the next 10 years.” Moving forward, Stanley is thinking about its long-term brand strategy, how it can use the viral moment to expand to new markets and how it can associate itself within cultural moments and influencers. This includes diversifying its product line into more than houseware. Stanley plans to expand its hydration market to include health and protein products as well as cafe and bar culture with products for wine, beer and cocktails. Trends are great. They don’t last. It’s important to use momentous occasions to, not pause and celebrate, but keep the momentum going.

The Biden-era AI Safety Institute is being rebranded as The Center for AI Standards and Innovation, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this week, according to Deadline. “The rebrand reflects a more hands-off approach that the Trump administration has taken to AI, after President Joe Biden often addressed AI by spotlighting the need for guardrails around the technology, and lined up major AI companies to agree to a set of voluntary commitments for ‘responsible innovation’,” the article said. Rebrands can be chances for renewal and modernization. The approach should reflect core values. It’s clear that this administration’s take on AI is more attuned to innovation rather than safety and that is reflected in the name change. Lutnick addresses the rebrand by framing it as a positive approach to allow creators to have freer reign around AI innovation. It’s important to have clear messaging that aligns with brand strategy or you’ll risk losing trust.

From partnering with more health systems to testing a generative AI-powered health assistant, here are seven of Amazon’s healthcare moves reported by Becker’s since January:

On June 3, Amazon Pharmacy rolled out new features aimed at easing the burden of medication management, particularly for caregivers and older adults with complex prescriptions. These features include allowing verified family members or trusted individuals to manage medications for loved ones through their own Amazon accounts and expanding access to its PillPack service for Medicare Part D beneficiaries.

Trent Green, CEO of One Medical since 2023, left the primary care company in March for a new role at National Research Corp., a healthcare analytics and services provider. Amazon acquired One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2023.

New York City-based NYU Langone Health became the first system to install Amazon’s palm-spanning technology for patient check-ins.

In February, New York City-based Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center partnered with Amazon Web Services to accelerate cancer innovation and research through AI, high-performance computing and cloud technologies.

In January, Bronx, N.Y.-based Montefiore Health System partnered with Amazon’s One Medical to expand access to primary care. As part of the collaboration, One Medical will open its first primary care clinic in Westchester County, N.Y., next year, in affiliation with the 10-hospital academic system.

In the first quarter of 2025, despite retailer inventory destocking and modest sales, NOMD grew its gross margin by 90 basis points year over year to 27.8%. While this growth was driven by supply-chain productivity gains and favorable year-over-year inventory effects, it reflects NOMD’s broader strategy of pairing operational efficiency with long-term innovation in high-margin categories like fish.

The relaunch of sub-brands like Fish Bar in Italy, featuring snack-sized fish fingers for younger and higher-income consumers, showcases how the company uses innovation to unlock new occasions and drive category penetration. Early results are compelling, the company’s retail sales of fish products in Italy rose 9% year over year in the first quarter. Additionally, the new Captain’s Discoveries line in the United Kingdom aims to spice up traditional frozen meals with modern flavors, appealing to evolving consumer palates. As a result, innovation is on track to increase as a percentage of sales again in 2025, reinforcing NOMD’s ability to support margins even as input costs tick up.

Rather than cutting investments, Nomad is doubling down on advertising and product upgrades. NOMD is confident that its innovation-led flywheel can keep gross margins resilient. The company’s execution in transforming traditional frozen fish into an exciting, modern meal option is evidence that its innovation pipeline is not only working, but helping buffer margin pressures.

How Are NOMD Rivals CAG & KHC Approaching?

While NOMD sharpens its margin edge through targeted innovation in frozen meals and fish, Conagra Brands CAG and The Kraft Heinz Company KHC are intensifying their own innovation strategies to stay competitive.

Conagra continues to modernize its portfolio. Recently acquired FATTY Smoked Meat Sticks is enhancing its leading position in the high-growth, high-margin meat stick category. Conagra also focuses on aligning its frozen and snacks offerings with evolving consumer needs, emphasizing convenience and flavor.

Kraft Heinz is leveraging global trends by expanding bold flavor profiles across sauces and launching wellness-centric products like Mio & Wine, a zero-sugar hydration brand. Kraft Heinz's innovation strategy is broad, spanning global flavor fusion, ready meals and functional beverages.

McDonald's U.S. president Joe Erlinger confirmed on ""Good Morning America"" in December 2024 that the fan-favorite Snack Wrap would be making a comeback sometime in 2025. In April 2025, the chain's social media accounts shared another clue to the wrap's official return date.

Finally, McDonald's confirmed to USA TODAY on June 3 that the Snack Wrap will officially be coming back to restaurants permanently beginning Thursday, July 10.

The company said the Snack Wraps will feature one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips – a juicy chicken strip made with all white meat – topped with crisp shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, all wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.

Popeyes, meanwhile, announced on June 2 it is introducing Chicken Wraps to its menu for a limited time, giving customers the ""craveable flavor of Popeyes, now wrapped and ready to go wherever you do,"" according to a news release.

The wraps feature Popeyes hand-breaded and battered chicken tenders with crispy lettuce, shredded cheese and crunchy pickles, all in a warm tortilla that's inspired by the flavor of Popeyes biscuits, according to the company. The new item will cost $3.99 and will be available with your choice of a Classic, Spicy, or Honey Mustard spread.

Chicken wraps send social media into a tizzy

Popeyes appeared to instigate the latest fast food chicken battle on May 30 when it took a jab at McDonald's X post from April 15 hinting at a possible return date for the Snack Wrap.

McDonald's post from April 15 read: ""snack wraps 0x.14.2025,"" hinting that the menu item would return on the 14th day of an unidentified month in 2025.

""Chicken wraps 0x.02.2025,"" Popeyes said on May 30.

On June 3, McDonald's posted ""snack wrap 07.10.2025"" on X, followed by a long post giving a behind-the-scenes look at how the company made the decision to bring the Snack Wrap back.

Popeyes responded to that post on the same day with another jab at McDonald's.

Popeyes also took to another social media platform, Instagram, to poke fun at McDonald's. Popeyes was among the first to comment on McDonald's post announcing the Snack Wraps, saying ""glad we could make that happen,"" with a smirking emoji.

In addition to the brands going at each other on social media, customers are also expressing excitement about both menu items.

Other chains with chicken wraps

Although not a part of the chicken wrap war happening currently, fast food chains like Wendy's, Chick-Fil-A, and Dairy Queen all have the offering on their menus. Places like Burger King and Taco Bell did venture into chicken wraps at one point, but eventually discontinued them from the menu.

Zaxby's does not have a chicken wrap, but they had this to say about the current war between McDonald's and Popeye's: ""Snack wraps are back?! See you at Zaxbys in 15 min when you're still hungry.""

Even so, there are signs that many if not all of those unpurchased Rite Aid locations will simply cease being drugstores.
CVS said last month it is getting prescription files from 625 Rite Aid stores in the 15 states where Rite Aid operates.
Since Rite Aid went back into bankruptcy on May 5, it has announced around 360 closures nationwide, including 19 Rite Aid stores and five Bartell stores in Washington.
As of early May, the site showed around 39 Bartell locations, down from 68 shortly after the Rite Aid sale.","For Seattle-area shoppers watching the systematic dismemberment of Bartell Drugs and its bankrupt parent Rite Aid, the math has been pretty discouraging.

Drugstore rival CVS said last month it was acquiring 64 Rite Aid and Bartell locations in Washington, Oregon and Idaho as part of a court-approved fire sale to repay Rite Aid’s massive debts after a failed turnaround.

But CVS hasn’t said which locations it’s buying. And in any case, those 64 stores represent barely a third of the nearly 190 Rite Aid locations in the three states; Washington alone has 95 Rite Aid stores and around 39 Bartell Drugs.

That gap does not bode well for customers of the roughly 120 Rite Aid and Bartell locations that CVS isn’t buying, experts say. They point to the apparent lack of other buyers, not to mention the steady stream of Rite Aid and Bartell closures, including 11 more announced last week in Washington.

“It looks to me like the stores that have not been picked up by CVS were underperforming locations (and) are slated for closure,” said Daniel Gielchinsky, a Florida bankruptcy attorney who has closely followed the Rite Aid saga since its first Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2023.

Like other industry observers, Gielchinsky worries that additional closures will leave many communities with even fewer pharmacy options.

Rite Aid didn’t respond when asked Thursday about the fate of unsold Rite Aid or Bartell locations, or if other sales were planned.

CVS also declined to share much in way of detail about plans for the 64 stores it is buying.

That will need to wait until after the proposed “transactions start closing,” said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault. The deals “are still going through federal and state reviews and numbers may shift during the review process,” she added.

Even so, there are signs that many if not all of those unpurchased Rite Aid locations will simply cease being drugstores.

As part of the liquidation process, Rite Aid said last month that, in addition to selling a number of actual stores, it had agreed to the “transition” of “pharmacy assets” — including customers’ prescription files — from more than 1,000 Rite Aid locations to CVS and other competitors.

CVS said last month it is getting prescription files from 625 Rite Aid stores in the 15 states where Rite Aid operates.

CVS declined to say which stores’ prescription files it was acquiring and didn’t respond when asked if the transfer of those prescription files meant a location would be closed.

Gielchinsky thinks the transfer of prescription business means those locations “will most likely not be pharmacies anymore.” He says customers will likely be “getting notices saying, ‘now your closest location is going to be here …’ because this one doesn’t exist anymore.”

At several to-be-closed Rite Aid and Bartell locations in the Seattle area, employees said their customers’ prescription files were being moved to nearby Rite Aid or Bartell locations that were slated to become CVS stores.

Pharmacy assets from 200 or so Rite Aid stores weren’t purchased at all, according to media reports, although the location of those stores isn’t clear.

Because the full extent of the Rite Aid closures isn’t yet known, it’s hard to say how the company’s liquidation will contribute to the larger trend of declining pharmacy accessibility and so-called pharmacy deserts. But it’s almost certain to accelerate that decline.

In Washington, 1.2 million people lived in census tracts with low access to pharmacies, as of 2022, according to a study by the University of Washington.

A “low access” tract was defined as one where at least a third of residents lived a certain distance from a pharmacy — a mile or more in an urban tract; 5 or more miles in suburban tracts and 10 miles or more in rural tracts.

Several factors have fueled the shrinking number of brick-and-mortar pharmacies.

Pharmacy profits have narrowed under competition from online rivals, such as Amazon. They’ve also been squeezed by the growing power of intermediaries, known as pharmacy benefit managers, that largely dictate prices paid to pharmacies by insurance companies.

At the same time, nonpharmacy, “front of store” sales have been hurt by competitors ranging from Amazon to Dollar Stores, and by problems like shoplifting and the loss of customers due to remote work during the pandemic, especially in urban areas such as downtown Seattle.

That has all been compounded by the fact that many drugstore chains, including Bartell, expanded rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. By the 2010s, the industry faced hundreds of locations that were unprofitable or barely breaking even.

All these changes were especially devastating for Bartell Drugs, which depended heavily on its front-of-store sales, and contributed to the Bartell family’s decision to sell the regional chain to Rite Aid in 2020.

Nationally, nearly 30% of the pharmacies that were open between 2010 and 2020 had closed by 2021, according to a study published last year in the journal Health Affairs.

The study noted that the “risk for closure for pharmacies in predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods was higher than in White neighborhoods.”

The pace of closure appears to have quickened since. One driver, clearly, was the pandemic, but another was the ongoing failure of Rite Aid, which was struggling even before it bought Bartell in 2020 for $95 million. Over the next several years, it shuttered hundreds of stores, including many Bartell locations, in an effort to cut costs.

Of the 81 pharmacies Washington state lost between January 2023 and March 2024, 26 were Bartell stores and 25 were Rite Aid stores, according to the Washington State Pharmacy Association.

That trend shows no sign of slowing anytime soon.

Since Rite Aid went back into bankruptcy on May 5, it has announced around 360 closures nationwide, including 19 Rite Aid stores and five Bartell stores in Washington.

Closures are also mounting at other chains. In October, Walgreens said it planned to shutter 1,200 stores over several years.

CVS, which had more than 9,000 stores in 2021, closed around 900 of them between 2022 and 2024 and recently confirmed plans for an additional 270 closures, according to a report in USA Today.

Adding insult to injury, where Rite Aid proclaimed its intent to keep not only the Bartell name but also the Bartell business model, CVS hasn’t commented on the future of the 135-year-old Bartell brand, which most retail experts think is effectively dead.

Instead, in a statement last month, CVS said it is “excited to introduce” former Rite Aid customers “to our best-in-class front store and pharmacy offerings.”

As of Thursday, Bartell Drugs is no longer honoring Bartell Drugs or Rite Aid gift cards or accepting returns or exchanges, according to notices at Bartell locations and on the Bartell website.

The online Bartell store locator appears to be disabled. As of early May, the site showed around 39 Bartell locations, down from 68 shortly after the Rite Aid sale. With the latest closure announcements, that would fall to around 34.

Gielchinsky, the bankruptcy attorney, says it’s still possible that another company could buy some or all of the unpurchased Rite Aid and Bartell stores.

Prospective buyers have until June 18 to bid on remaining assets, though it’s unclear whether that includes retail locations.

But Gielchinsky thinks any such sale is a low-odds prospect, given that potential buyers have had months to look over Rite Aid’s stores and pharmacy operations.

If a sale were going to happen, he said, “I think it would have happened by now.”

Hiroki Asai, who has acted as the platform’s global head of marketing since 2020, is moving into the newly created role of chief experience officer, where he will oversee Van Dyck.

Van Dyck’s resume includes past stints at Meta, Apple, Levi Strauss and creative agency Wieden + Kennedy. She departed Meta in 2022 after acting as chief operating officer of its Reality Labs division dedicated to developing virtual reality products and the metaverse. The executive began working with Airbnb earlier this year in a consultative capacity.

The Washington Department of Ecology fined 23 plastic producers a combined $277,000 for not complying with a 2021 state law requiring them to use a minimum amount of recycled material in single-use beverage containers and trash bags.

The penalties were based on the amount of plastic each company sold in Washington in 2024, and how far from the minimum recycled content requirements they were. Ecology reviews annual reports submitted by the covered product producers to identify those that are not meeting the minimum recycled content requirements.

Fines for the 23 companies ranged from $194 to $54,868. Some producers may receive penalty reductions if they requested and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with Ecology after receiving the first Notice of Violation.

Since 2022, companies that produce plastic trash bags must include a minimum of 10% recycled content, while the producers of beverage containers are required to include at least 15% recycled content. In 2025, the recycled content minimum for trash bags increases to 15%, and more types of plastic bottles are covered.

“Several producers made applaudable gains last year increasing their recycled content in spite of not reaching the required minimum amount,” said Ecology’s Solid Waste Program Manager Peter Lyon. “These and other producers will need to expand those efforts in the coming years as the law continues to cover a wider range of products with increased minimum recycled content requirements.”

By 2036, Washington’s law will cover many types of common consumer packaging and require at least 50% recycled content.

Last year, Ecology issued its first penalties totaling more than $416,000 to 35 companies that failed to comply with this law.

Producer compliance and penalty amounts

Under the law, plastic packaging producers are required to report the weight of new and recycled content plastic for covered products sold in Washington. Producers that fell short of the recycled content requirements were issued penalties based on the minimum requirement, the recycled content achieved, the weight of plastic resin sold in the state, and a 20 cent multiplier.

The table below shows the producers that received penalties, the amount of recycled content they achieved, and the penalty they were issued for not meeting the minimum requirements.

Washington’s plastic imports

According to 2024 data from plastic manufacturers, almost 170 million pounds of plastic trash bags and beverage containers were sold in Washington – 75% of it made from virgin material, while the remaining 25% was recycled. And that’s only counting the containers and bags already required to report under the law.

The UK’s Energy sector is under increasing pressure to do more for those who need it most. In its refreshed Customer Vulnerability Strategy, Ofgem made its expectations clear: companies must improve how they identify vulnerable customers, use data more intelligently, and deliver meaningful, inclusive support. This includes helping those struggling with bills, enhancing customer service for at-risk groups, and driving innovation that leaves no one behind.

But meeting these expectations is no small feat – especially in a landscape shaped by rising inflation, surging energy prices, and a growing number of people facing financial, physical, and digital vulnerabilities. Today, nearly one-third of the UK population is considered financially vulnerable, and an estimated 6.1 million households are living in fuel poverty, according to National Energy Action*. From pensioners and people with disabilities to those facing language barriers or living in non-traditional housing, the definition of vulnerability is evolving. It is no longer a static label but dynamic, multifaceted, and often hidden.

As the energy transition accelerates, vulnerable customers risk being left behind – unable or unwilling to engage with new technologies or benefit from flexibility schemes designed to lower energy bills. When the decision is between heating or eating, the choice for vulnerable people is clear.

How can we, as an industry, tackle these challenges for those that need our help?

We know that identifying and supporting these vulnerable customers isn’t just a regulatory requirement, it’s a passion driven by many in individual organisations across the industry.

Each of the challenges facing the Energy sector – rising fuel poverty, hidden vulnerabilities, digital exclusion, and the complexity of the energy transition – requires tailored, thoughtful responses. But underpinning all of these is a common thread: the need for better data and smarter systems to pave the way for the sector to provide stronger support for vulnerable customers.

Here’s how:

1. Identifying vulnerable customers with precision

For a long time, we’ve relied on the Priority Services Register (PSR) as a proxy for identifying consumers in vulnerable situations. But this traditional method of identifying vulnerability – based on age, income, or disability – is no longer sufficient. Because vulnerability is shifting and hard to pin down, and many circumstances or characteristics aren’t captured by the existing codes included in the PSR.

In its refresh strategy, Ofgem recognises that some suppliers operate their own ‘PSR+’ which goes above and beyond the industry agreed needs codes. However, it’s not a common or standardised mechanism.

With the right data strategy, you can go beyond surface-level indicators to build a more complete, real-time picture of who needs support. By integrating diverse data sources – such as payment history, PSR enrolment, housing type, and even weather data – AI models can detect patterns and flag customers who may be at risk before they reach crisis point. This enables proactive outreach, not just reactive response.

2. Planning for vulnerability, not just reacting to it

Once vulnerable customers are identified, the next step is to plan for their needs. This means embedding vulnerability into operational planning, by:

Ensuring customer service agents know a customer is vulnerable from the second a call/chat is connected and how to tailor advice to that customer’s specific vulnerability

Making available appropriate advice based on a customer’s specific circumstances

Outage responses

Infrastructure investment

For example, if a power cut is forecast in a certain area, AI can instantly identify which customers in that zone are vulnerable and trigger automated workflows to ensure they receive timely support—whether that’s a welfare check, backup power, or alternative accommodation.

3. Delivering personalised, scalable support

AI-powered segmentation allows companies to tailor communications and services to different types of vulnerability. Someone with limited digital access may need a phone call, while another customer with low financial resilience might benefit from targeted payment support or energy efficiency advice.

This is where platforms like Salesforce come in. As the leading CRM in the energy and utilities sector, Salesforce enables organisations to:

Unify customer data across systems for a 360° view

Automate workflows for proactive support

Track and report on vulnerability metrics

Coordinate across teams and partners to deliver joined-up services

4. Driving behavioural change during the toughest times

Data and AI can play a pivotal role in designing more effective campaigns, especially during critical periods like winter. By analysing past campaign performance and customer behaviour, organisations can refine their messaging, target the right audiences, and shift the focus from heating homes to heating people. Additionally, AI can help identify and align with key trigger points – ensuring that timely, relevant advice reaches customers exactly when they need it, increasing engagement and uptake. This approach also builds long-term resilience by helping customers reduce energy use and access support earlier.

5. Embedding vulnerability into the energy transition

As the energy system evolves, we must ensure vulnerable customers, and their needs, are adequately considered. Climate change impacts us all but the people who are vulnerable are impacted the most by it and they might not be able to move to escape it. Companies must ensure sustainability and suitability for everyone in the networks they build.

Keep an eye out for our next blog, in which we’ll take a closer look at vulnerability in the energy transition.

Let’s collaborate to drive the change

No single organisation in the Energy sector can tackle the complex challenge of vulnerability. It requires a united effort across suppliers, networks, regulators, tech providers, and community groups to ensure no one is left behind.

Initiatives like shared data trusts, vulnerability registers, and partnerships with local services can accelerate progress. Especially when grounded in trust and community connection.

Data and AI are key enablers. When used ethically and collaboratively, they offer a fuller picture of customer needs, enabling smarter, faster, and fairer supply.

By working together, we can pool insights, co-develop solutions, and align standards – from data-sharing protocols to definitions of vulnerability. Together, we can drive long-term change.

We’re working with Salesforce to build solutions that do exactly this – combining world-class technology with deep sector expertise to support those who need it most. If you’re facing similar challenges and are driven by the same passion for your customers, we’d love to collaborate.",https://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/01/GettyImages-1491213756.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 15:08:25.161330

It is driven by creative thinkers who can create cultures of creative thinking and not cultures of creative craft,” he highlighted.
How Leo is cracking the Gen Z code In a time when agencies lament the revolving-door nature of young talent, Leo is quietly flipping the script.
“Talent respects talent.
Where the agency itself is the star.” For Rao, the legacy of a creative agency isn’t built on momentary brilliance.","New Delhi: When Amitesh Rao took charge of Leo South Asia 18 months ago, he inherited what he calls “a fantastic agency… extremely successful, very healthy, with a very strong culture and DNA.”

The mandate was not rescue but acceleration—building new muscle on a proven frame so the shop could claim, and keep, the global top spot.

“To get to No. 1 in the world—and then stay there—takes a very different orientation from simply scaling a peak and sliding down,” said Rao, CEO of Leo South Asia.

That orientation has already produced visible markers. Leo finished 2024 as the world’s No. 1 agency on the WARC Effectiveness Index and No. 3 on the Global Effie Index.

Yet Rao insisted that awards and recognition are “only outcomes.” His own scorecard, he said, tracks the everyday choices that make those outcomes inevitable.

Transformation as a daily discipline

Rao’s definition of success starts with continuous reinvention:

Relentless capability-building: “You have to keep on changing, keep on growing, keep on embracing new technologies, new ways of working, new kinds of talent—every day, every month, every year.”

Strategic heavy-lifting: A concerted investment in strategy has “put a very strong strategic grounding under every idea,” which Rao credited for the agency’s Effie surge.

A broader craft palette: Over 18 months, Leo has layered technology, digital, commerce, and experiential onto its traditional creative core.

Partnership mindset: The shop now collaborates “a lot more with entities around us within Publicis Groupe and outside,” including a creative-intelligence partnership with Google.

“Being in permanent build-mode is what drives growth,” Rao emphasised.

What actually fuelled 2024’s numbers

With the industry growing in healthy double digits, Leo’s Indian operations expanded at almost twice that pace, Rao claimed. He pinpointed three engines:

Why the global push matters

Indian agencies have rarely been tapped to lead creative thinking for overseas markets, but Rao believes that should change: “Indian creative and strategic talent is some of the best in the world. Leo is at the vanguard of proving that, and I want the entire market to become a fertile ground for global work cracked out of here.”

Culture, not just capability

Rao argued that talent expectations, employment structures and agency hierarchies are shifting just as fast as technology. Leo’s task, therefore, is as cultural as it is commercial: create an environment where diverse specialists—strategists, technologists, commerce planners, and experiential designers—can “flourish” under a single creative idea.

Leadership changes over the past year, he added, have “dramatically accelerated both the pace of growth and the quality of work.”

Looking to 2025, Rao’s biggest challenge is consistency. “If you stop moving, you’re actually sliding backwards,” he said. The plan is to keep the agency in permanent build-mode, extend its overseas footprint and deepen partnerships at home—so that next year’s trophies remain, as ever, mere by-products of a system built to improve itself every day.

“Growth comes from partnering, not protecting turf”

For decades, advertising networks carved their authority out of fenced-off expertise: media in one silo, Creative in another, public relations in another, and digital in a third. Rao argued that the playbook is now reversed. “This is a collaborative economy. Growth is coming from collaboration, not from territorialism. The world of ‘I’ll do everything’ is gone,” he told BestMediaInfo.com

Rao points to the broader corporate landscape to make his case. “Forget advertising—look at Microsoft,” he said. “It transformed from a company that tried to do everything inside Windows to one that now collaborates with OpenAI, Intel, NVIDIA. Their growth is coming through collaborations.”

The same dynamic, he added, defines modern start-ups and unicorns in India and abroad: “Their stories are stories of collaboration.”

Why advertising must give up its moat mentality

Historically, creative agencies have guarded their domains. Rao called that stance obsolete.

“Creative companies have always said, ‘This is my area; I don’t want anyone else involved.’ That’s an old way of thinking.”

The future, he contended, lies in stitching together outside capabilities—technology vendors, shopper-marketing specialists, experiential partners, PR outfits—so the client receives “a solution that is much closer to reality.”

Building a culture and a commercial model for partnership

Leo’s internal systems have been rebuilt around that philosophy. “We’re a collaborative agency. We work with technologists, PR people, shopper experts, experiential designers, and commerce teams—lots of different capabilities. We cannot sit and build everything in-house,” Rao said.

The agency’s job now includes finding the right culture fit and structuring commercial arrangements that let external and internal talent share the same brief without friction.

Investing in “creative thinkers,” not just writers and art directors

One visible outcome is the hiring pattern of the past 18 months. “We have onboarded creative technologists and creators,” Rao shared. But the definition of creativity has widened far beyond ad-school resumes:

Lawyers who understand the narrative power of regulation

Even dentists, whom Rao labels “pure creative minds”

“Creativity is not the prerogative of a writer,” he stressed. “Ten years ago, you had to write well or visualise well to be considered creative because that was the only way to express ideas. Now technology lifts that burden, which means anyone with imagination can contribute.”

Rao positions this infusion of diverse talent alongside the agency’s parallel investment in deeper strategy. “The other big area of investment has been in creative technologists—part of our broader push to expand creative thinkers,” he said. Together, strategic rigour and tech-enabled expression form the bedrock of the collaborations Leo pursues with outside partners.

“It’s time to separate creativity from craft,” emphasised Rao

In an industry where words like ""craft"" and ""storytelling"" are often held up as sacred, Rao is unafraid to challenge the very foundation of modern advertising thinking.

“The belief that advertising is a craft has to be deeply questioned,” Rao said bluntly. “That world is gone.”

It’s a provocative stance, especially coming from the leader of one of India’s most awarded creative agencies. But Rao’s argument isn’t about diminishing the role of artistry; it’s about unbundling it from the evolving definition of creativity in the age of scale, speed, and systems.

Historically, advertising creativity was synonymous with individuals who could write beautifully or visualise with flair. That model, Rao argued, is outdated.

“Craft was the prerogative of a few personalities—great writers, brilliant visualisers. But today, it’s about imagination, not execution,” he explained. “Creative thinking now exists independent of craft. And we need to separate the two.”

Rao envisions the agency of the future not as a collective of star talent but as a system designed to generate ideas from anyone, anywhere.

“I think the agency of the future is not driven by a personality or an individual or a group of individuals who are great at craft. It is driven by creative thinkers who can create cultures of creative thinking and not cultures of creative craft,” he highlighted.

How Leo is cracking the Gen Z code

In a time when agencies lament the revolving-door nature of young talent, Leo is quietly flipping the script. At the heart of it is a cultural reset—one that reframes the entire conversation about what it means to “retain” the next generation of creative minds.

“Retention is not the goal. It’s the outcome,” said Rao. “The real question is—how do you create an environment where talent can flourish?”

It’s a deceptively simple idea that Rao believes will define the agency model of the future. For him, the conversation is no longer about giving talent jobs but about creating systems that allow them to think, build, lead, and—most importantly—belong.

Rao is quick to dismantle the familiar industry gripe that Gen Z lacks loyalty.

“They’re incredibly loyal—but not to companies. They’re loyal to belief systems, to purpose, to identity,” he said. “They don’t care about hierarchy; they don’t blindly respect experience or even knowledge. They respect talent.”

He told BestMediaInfo.com that once, Leo invited a cross-section of its Gen Z employees to present to the agency’s leadership team on how they define themselves. The result, Rao said, was eye-opening.

“We were asking the wrong question: ‘How do I hold a Gen Z’s attention?’ What we should be asking is: ‘How do I earn it?’”

That one shift, he said, changed everything.

For agencies grappling with attrition, disengagement, and a disconnect with the young workforce, Leo’s playbook under Rao offers an alternative: stop chasing loyalty; earn belief. Create space. Remove ego. Rethink what leadership looks like.

“Talent respects talent. That’s the culture we’ve built. And that’s why they stay.”

“Not Just a flash in the pan,” Rao on the pursuit of consistent greatness at Leo

When asked about what keeps Rao up at night, the answer has nothing to do with awards or client pitches. It’s something far more enduring—and far more difficult.

“I’m obsessed with the idea of consistency,” Rao said. “In 30–35 years of ATP tennis rankings, there have been maybe 25 world No. 1s. Only three of them stayed at the top for more than two years. Staying good consistently—that’s the real challenge.”

It’s a rare mindset in an industry often driven by momentary wins and campaign highs. Rao’s north star isn’t just producing great work; it’s building a system where “greatness is repeatable,” regardless of who’s in the room.

“I ask myself, how do I create a culture and a system where success isn’t episodic but systemic? When five people leave, the work is still world-class. Where the agency itself is the star.”

For Rao, the legacy of a creative agency isn’t built on momentary brilliance. It’s built on the systems, cultures, and mindsets that make brilliance inevitable—again and again and again.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/bmi/media/media_files/2025/06/06/YjImclLxYEIfUtaDawnG.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 12:18:37.473344

Christine Barone, CEO of Dutch Bros One person wrote on Facebook: ""FYI…Dutch Bros is better than Starbucks AND CHEAPER.","A BELOVED coffee chain that customers have dubbed ""cheaper than Starbucks"" is set to open five new locations.

The company is expanding to multiple states across the US, and over 100 new locations are planned for this year alone.

The coffee chain Dutch Bros is making its biggest moves yet, as it looks to move into new territory.

Dutch Bros sells protein coffee, blended drinks, energy drinks, shakes, and muffin tops.

As of June this year, Dutch Bros has locations across 18 states in the US.

After opening its first franchise back in 2000, it has set its sights on a lofty target for the rest of the decade.

It seems to be off to a good start, as Dutch Bros finished the first quarter of 2025 with 30 new locations.

These can be found in states such as Alabama, Colorado and Texas.

By the end of 2025, Dutch Bros plans to add 160 locations around the country.

This move will see them entering five new states, including Indiana, Ohio, Louisiana, Georgia, and South Carolina.

It's all building to the massive expectations Dutch Bros has placed on itself, with thousands of spots to be open in the coming years.

Chief executive officer Christine Barone told USA Today: ""With a strong roadmap ahead, we are focused on our bold goal of reaching 2,029 shops in 2029.

""Led by field operations teams deeply rooted in our culture and supported by a leadership team with complementary skills and firsthand knowledge of scale, we are well positioned to deliver sustainable, long-term value.""

Dutch Bros did not confirm which cities in these states the new spots will be found in.

BRO LOVE

The expansion plans might sound bold, but there is a lot of love for Dutch Bros on social media.

Some have even gone as far as to say it's better than Starbucks, one of the leaders in the coffee world.

With a strong roadmap ahead, we are focused on our bold goal of reaching 2,029 shops in 2029.

Christine Barone, CEO of Dutch Bros

One person wrote on Facebook: ""FYI…Dutch Bros is better than Starbucks AND CHEAPER. So heavenly.""

There were plenty of comments to back this up, too.

A Dutch Bros supporter said: ""Yessss! Rylan and I are addicted to Dutch bros since it opened here.

""They also have a ton of sugar free options that actually taste good!

""We also have a huge collection of stickers and merch. They do fun drops every month.""

While another enthusiastic customer added: ""They are awesome about sugar free options.

""And every person working there that I’ve encountered, is so friendly.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/06/newspress-collage-ktk1bjn1q-1749216727836.jpg?1749202343&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-06-06 12:19:32.926967

Zacks Investment Research","Innovation lies at the heart of Nomad Foods Limited’s NOMD management strategy, driving long-term growth and competitive advantage. In the first quarter of 2025, despite retailer inventory destocking and modest sales, NOMD grew its gross margin by 90 basis points year over year to 27.8%. While this growth was driven by supply-chain productivity gains and favorable year-over-year inventory effects, it reflects NOMD’s broader strategy of pairing operational efficiency with long-term innovation in high-margin categories like fish.

The relaunch of sub-brands like Fish Bar in Italy, featuring snack-sized fish fingers for younger and higher-income consumers, showcases how the company uses innovation to unlock new occasions and drive category penetration. Early results are compelling, the company’s retail sales of fish products in Italy rose 9% year over year in the first quarter. Additionally, the new Captain’s Discoveries line in the United Kingdom aims to spice up traditional frozen meals with modern flavors, appealing to evolving consumer palates. As a result, innovation is on track to increase as a percentage of sales again in 2025, reinforcing NOMD’s ability to support margins even as input costs tick up.

Rather than cutting investments, Nomad is doubling down on advertising and product upgrades. NOMD is confident that its innovation-led flywheel can keep gross margins resilient. The company’s execution in transforming traditional frozen fish into an exciting, modern meal option is evidence that its innovation pipeline is not only working, but helping buffer margin pressures.

How Are NOMD Rivals CAG & KHC Approaching?

While NOMD sharpens its margin edge through targeted innovation in frozen meals and fish, Conagra Brands CAG and The Kraft Heinz Company KHC are intensifying their own innovation strategies to stay competitive.

Conagra continues to modernize its portfolio. Recently acquired FATTY Smoked Meat Sticks is enhancing its leading position in the high-growth, high-margin meat stick category. Conagra also focuses on aligning its frozen and snacks offerings with evolving consumer needs, emphasizing convenience and flavor.

Kraft Heinz is leveraging global trends by expanding bold flavor profiles across sauces and launching wellness-centric products like Mio & Wine, a zero-sugar hydration brand. Kraft Heinz's innovation strategy is broad, spanning global flavor fusion, ready meals and functional beverages.

The large integrated PBMs are facing continued pressure to provide transparency and models that are aligned with employers’ and plans’ interests.
These larger PBMs, however, say they continue to introduce new options to provide customers with transparency.
“They [the larger PBMs] have discovered that transparency is an important value that the market wants,” Shields said in an interview with Managed Healthcare Executive earlier this year.
Transparency for many PBMs “goes out the window on the rebate side,” Jasniewski said in a recent interview.","Pharmacy benefit management is a system that many say is broken. Traditional, vertically integrated PBMs lack alignment with payers and patients in a system that is complex, opaque and secretive, say many of the smaller and midsize PBMs that Formulary Watch and Managed Healthcare Executive (MHE) have spoken with for an effort to create a PBM directory. Several common themes emerged from our survey.

In this series on the PBM industry, we’ll highlight several of them. Last week, we addressed state PBM reform efforts that are filling a void left by inaction on the federal level.

In this story, we are turning our attention to transparency. “Transparency is not just a buzzword in the PBM space,” said Justin Jasniewski, CEO of Serve You Rx, one upstart PBMs that is positioning itself as an alternative to the large PBMs that dominate the industry. “If I could change one thing, it would be making the entire ecosystem, both PBM and medical, more transparent, so that providers can compete on price versus consumers just bearing the cost of whatever it is,” he said in an interview with MHE. Jasniewski has been selected as one of this year’s Managed Healthcare Executive Emerging Leaders in Healthcare.

The next story in this series will look at the high list price of drugs, including the glucagon-like peptide 1 drugs and the affordability of drugs for consumers.

Formulary Watch and Managed Healthcare Executive have also begun an initiative to develop a database of PBMs. You can find the PBM Directory here. We will continue to add to this list as more information becomes available.

A veil of secrecy

PBMs were originally created to administer pharmacy benefit programs. But over time, acquisitions and vertical integration of pharmacies, PBMs, group purchasing organizations and health plans have created what some critics ay are conflicts of interest and misaligned incentives. The three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, which is part of CVS Health; Express Scripts, which is part of Cigna; Optum Rx, which part of UnitedHealth Group — control about 80% of the pharmacy benefit market. Beyond the “big three” are smaller companies with many trying to disrupt the sector.

The large integrated PBMs are facing continued pressure to provide transparency and models that are aligned with employers’ and plans’ interests. “Employer dissatisfaction and lawsuits that bring the fiduciary responsibility of the employer to light, inclusive of how their PBM vendors’ motivations and business practices impact everything from data access to the prices paid for drugs,” executives from Capital Rx said in our outreach for the PBM Directory.

Payers are increasingly dissatisfied with PBMs and want some degree of change, according to the results of a survey conducted last year by the consulting company Pharmaceutical Strategies Group (PSG). Customers of the big 3 PBMs reported lower satisfaction across most measures, including overall satisfaction, and they are less likely to recommend their PBM, the PSG survey found.

These larger PBMs, however, say they continue to introduce new options to provide customers with transparency. CVS Health, UnitedHealth Group, and Cigna have all committed to transparency efforts. During an investor call in February 2025, David Joyner, CEO of CVS Health, said that the company is on a “pharmacy transformation journey” that involves launching two programs that define drug costs, identify markups, and provide more insight into costs.

CVS Caremark has launched two programs. One is CVS CostVantage, which is a pharmacy reimbursement model that will define the drug cost and related reimbursement using a formula built on the cost of the drug, a set markup, and a fee that reflects the care and value of pharmacy services. The other is called TrueCost, a model that offers client pricing reflecting the true net cost of prescription drugs, with visibility into administrative fees.

UnitedHealth has said it will pass through 100% of the rebates it receives from drugmakers to its payer clients by 2028. The company will continue to encourage all its clients to fully pass these savings directly to patients at the point of sale, he said.

Cigna, starting in 2026, will release an annual “customer transparency” report to show how it’s progressing, including information about care facilitation and resolution statistics. Evernorth, Cigna’s health services division, has also said that it will focus on improving patient access to affordable medications and creating an Office of Excellence and Transformation to oversee these efforts.

Still, executives from Navitus said in our survey that the larger PBMs operate behind a veil of secrecy. “Despite wielding significant power in negotiating drug prices and managing formularies, some PBM practices disadvantage patients,” Navitus leaders said. “These practices include backroom deals with pharmaceutical companies where hefty rebates are offered on costly brand-name medications, only to have the PBMs hold back a large portion of these rebates as profit. PBMs often guide consumers to these drugs when less expensive generics are widely available. This lack of transparency and focus on financial gain creates a system where medication costs escalate, patient affordability is limited, and ultimately, patient health suffers.”

Navitus is a PBM that passes 100% of rebates and discounts on to plan sponsors and health plans and provides clients with full access to their data, down to the individual claim level.

Joe Shields, managing director of Transparency-Rx, a trade group of smaller PBMs, remains skeptical that the programs will do what they say. “They [the larger PBMs] have discovered that transparency is an important value that the market wants,” Shields said in an interview with Managed Healthcare Executive earlier this year. “From a branding and a marketing standpoint, they have to say they’ve embraced transparency. But the truth is, they largely remain as opaque and secretive in terms of their approaches.”

The opacity of the U.S. healthcare system has also led to wasteful spending, mostly for administrative costs, according to a 2023 analysis by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. “An entire ecosystem has been cobbled together to maintain and capitalize on preserving inefficiency,” leaders from Capital Rx said.

“Deliberately complex”

The consolidation of PBMs, group purchasing organizations (GPOs), and manufacturers under the same corporate umbrella reduces market competition, leaders from Scripius said in our survey. “This structure allows the dominant players to exert significant control over drug pricing and formulary design, limiting options for smaller competitors and restricting consumer choice.” Scripius is a PBM founded by Intermountain Health/Select Health.

Traditional PBM contracts are often deliberately complex and inflexible, with only 25% of customers reporting high satisfaction with their PBM’s transparency, Jasniewski said.

“This creates an environment where PBMs are incentivized to drive revenue to themselves at the expense of plan sponsors. The confusing contracts make it difficult for clients to understand what they're paying for or implement programs outside the PBM’s standard offerings without significant cost increases,” Serve You Rx executives said.

The real issue, said Kristin Begley, chief commercial officer at Capital Rx, is a lack of alignment. “It’s not hard to see what is wrong or missing in the PBM industry based on average wholesale price,” she said in a recent interview. “You have financial opacity, you have price discrimination, and you have misaligned economics, meaning the more the drug costs or the more the ultimate customer, plan sponsor, or union government spends, the more the PBM makes. AWP is an inflationary price source that can be manipulated by PBMs.”

Capital Rx is a PBM that launched in 2017 using national average drug acquisition cost (NADAC) pricing and charging an administration fee. NADAC is the approximate invoice price pharmacies pay for medications in the United States. CMS randomly surveys 2,500 pharmacies out of the 67,000 operating in the nation. It is updated weekly.

The need for PBMs to take on a fiduciary duty tied to pharmacy benefits was mentioned by several people in our survey. “A growing number of lawsuits related to breach of employer fiduciary duty have targeted large, well-known companies,” said executives from Liviniti. “Employers using PBMs that operate a traditional model, in which PBM revenue is linked to rebates and drug prices, have clear conflicts of interest. The traditional PBM model puts employers at risk—and drives up drug costs for their employees.

Liviniti is a PBM that serves self-insured employers, unions, hospitals, TPAs, and state and local governments and makes available to clients rebate details, network contracts, and audit information.

The opacity of the larger PBMs makes it nearly impossible for plan sponsors to evaluate whether their PBM is working in their best interest, said executives from Rightway. “The system is intentionally complex, and that complexity hides waste. To fix it, we need true fiduciary models, clear data, and PBMs that prioritize patient outcomes over profits.”

Rightway is a transparent PBM supported by a care navigation technology.

The rebate debate

Total manufacturer rebates paid to PBMs reached $334 billion for all brand-name drugs in 2023, according to a 2024 report from the Drug Channels Institute.

PBMs in our informal survey say the complex and nontransparent system of rebates and fees often obscures the true cost of medications, leaving payers uncertain about their actual financial obligations.

Transparency for many PBMs “goes out the window on the rebate side,” Jasniewski said in a recent interview. “There's a bigger push for rebate transparency,” he said.

Payers are increasingly open to alternatives to traditional programs. About 80% are interested in lower-cost drugs that offer no rebate at all, and more than 60% are interested in cost-plus pricing models, according to PSG’s newly released 2025 Trends in Specialty Drug Benefits Report. But two-thirds of the respondents said their plan has experienced an increase in the amount of rebates they have received in the last one to two years under the pharmacy benefit for specialty drugs, and just over half saw an increase under the medical benefit. The PSG report, co-sponsored by Genentech, was based on an annual survey conducted in September and October 2024. The survey included 231 benefit leaders from employers, health plans, and unions.

Morgan Lee, M.P.H., Ph.D., senior director of research and strategy at PSG, said in a recent interview that about a third of respondents to the survey are actively working to implement rebate alternatives. “It’s hard to move away from rebates. That’s part of why we see it being a little bit slow in terms of the real movement there.”

PSG is beginning to see a shift with some payers accepting lower guarantees in terms of rebates in exchange for implementing more utilization management. In the future, the number of payers who receive rebates may start to decline as more consider low-list-price biosimilars and as they begin to see more models without rebates.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/mhe/b240ba1cafb471f95116eb42168babf4a9846821-5824x3264.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format,N,,2025-06-06 12:16:50.834354

The consultation for SBTi's draft Corporate Net-Zero Standard v2 was open from March to June this year.

The standard focused on emissions reduction, while exploring ways to incentivise the scaling of CDR and climate finance, as well as looking at how to deal with barriers to addressing ""challenging"" Scope 3 value-chain emissions.

Scope 3 emissions refer to indirect emissions that occur across a company's value chain but account for more than 90% of emissions in big agriculture.

After five months at the bargaining table, the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) 3000 union voted to reject their employers’ latest contract by more than 97%.

The union represents nearly 30,000 grocery employees at Kroger-owned stores like Fred Meyer and QFC, and Albertsons-owned stores like Safeway.

“We authorized a strike to fight for better wages, better staffing, and a fully funded healthcare plan so that we can deliver the kind of service our customers deserve,” said Vickie Logerstedt, a cashier at Redmond Ridge QFC. “We have been more than patient for months, but these companies have offered nothing but crumbs and mealy language. Time has run out.”

The workers were asking the grocery chains for better wages, more staffing and improved healthcare.

UFCW 3000’s member-led bargaining team started contract negotiations with Kroger and Albertsons in January of 2025. The three-year contract covering Kroger and Albertsons grocery store workers in much of the Puget Sound area ended in May, but both parties agreed on a short contract extension to help reach an agreement.

Kroger told KIRO 7 on the day of the vote that it believes it’s offering a great deal and said: “We remain actively engaged in bargaining with UFCW 3000 because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption.”

It should be noted that a strike authorization vote does not mean a strike will occur.

“A strike at this stage is an unnecessary and disruptive action—especially given the meaningful wage increases and industry-leading healthcare we’re offering at the bargaining table,” said Todd Kammeyer, president of Fred Meyer. “We remain committed to continuing negotiations in good faith and urge union leadership to do the same.”

Another round of negotiations is scheduled for June 12 and 13. The contract extension agreement can be unilaterally terminated with a 72-hour notice, and a strike could not begin until after the 72-hour notice has run out.

Kroger told KIRO 7 it believes it’s offering a great deal and said: “We remain actively engaged in bargaining with UFCW 3000 because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption.”

A union spokesperson told KIRO 7 that all sides will return to the bargaining table on June 12-13, and workers are hoping this vote can send a message.

Fred Meyer and QFC will remain open.

Affective computing technologies introduce several ethical and regulatory challenges because they operate at a very personal level.","Forgive my impatience, but I feel strongly that the pace of affective computing adoption remains frustratingly slow. This is a field of study combining insights from computer science, psychology and cognitive science to build machines that can better understand and support their human counterparts – concepts that are now timelier than ever!

Extraordinary technologies are coming onstream that are bristling with human-like capabilities such as reasoning, planning and imagination. Yet still we interface them just like we did with dumb systems. A definite case of dumb and dumber in my book – especially with all the promise of affective computing. Economic prosperity, social wellbeing and everyday convenience are being held back by hesitance, ethical debates and, yes, outdated interface models.

Sentient Machines

The recently announced partnership between Sir Jony Ive and Sam Altman of OpenAI underlines my point. They described how computers are now seeing, thinking and understanding – yet despite that, humanity’s experience remains shaped by traditional products and interfaces.

For me, affective computing is a key enabling component for the future of human-machine interaction. It’s a future based on intelligent systems that partner with human cognition through human-machine understanding (HMU). HMU draws on insights from AI, cognitive science, neuroscience and psychology to enable machines to infer goals, interpret behaviour and adapt their support based on intent, workload, stress and experience – just as a good teammate would do.

Applying HMU in the right way will unlock new modes of collaboration, where humans and machines co-adapt and prosper in real time. This can transform sectors such as healthcare, industry and consumer. Some early adoptions of affective computing innovation have already resulted in use cases in wellbeing, media analytics, automotive and fraud detection.

Market Impact

The market for affective computing technologies is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Estimates are plentiful – and here are a couple of examples for perspective. Verified Market Research projects the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.5 per cent between 2026 and 2032, while LinkedIn cites a CAGR of 29.72 per cent from 2024 to 2030.

Healthcare Tech

Healthcare is just one area of huge opportunity. Affective computing technologies can be integrated into healthcare tech to provide more empathetic and personalised experiences.

This involves AI systems capable of recognising patient mental states, which allows for tailored support in areas such as mental health and wellbeing. Specifically, these technologies support patient care and diagnosis, with applications in socially assistive robotics to aid patient care, especially for mental health conditions. In remote patient monitoring affective computing can be used to detect signs of distress or changes in patient states, which ensures timely intervention and enhances the overall quality of care and life.

Media Analytics

In media analytics meanwhile, affective computing technologies are providing advanced systems that analyse real-time emotional responses to content. These systems utilise various inputs, including facial expressions, user attention, tone of voice and physiological signals, to provide deeper insights into audience engagement. This capability enables content creators and advertisers to optimise their material for maximum impact and tailor content to specific user profiles, enhancing the effectiveness of media and advertising.

Automotive Applications

Affective computing technologies are enhancing the automotive sector by creating safer and more comfortable driving experiences. These technologies monitor driver states and attentiveness to detect and prevent dangerous situations. By detecting driver distraction, drowsiness, stress or anger, affective computing can provide timely warnings or adjust vehicle settings to mitigate potential risks.

Crucially, these technologies facilitate more natural and intuitive human-machine interfaces within vehicles, improving communication and control by responding to the driver states. This becomes increasingly important as we move towards autonomous vehicles, and the role of the driver in the cabin evolves.

Fraud Detection

In fraud detection, affective computing can analyse subtle cues during financial transactions and online interactions. These systems primarily rely on voice and face ID. While there is interest in monitoring facial expressions and micro-expressions as indicators of fraudulent behaviour, this remains highly controversial and unreliable. Lightweight facial verification techniques use affective computing to detect faked user behaviour through bots, and to tackle user fraud better than typical CAPTCHA (setting a test to check if you’re human) approaches.

Stepping Up

My examples above illustrate the benefits of integrating just a part of what affective computing can achieve by augmenting existing systems. They are great benefits for sure – but they fall short of the step change that true Human-Machine Understanding can create. This brings me back to my opening message about urgency. We need a mind-shift across industry – a fundamental and collaborative rethink of how we work with machines.

Affective computing technologies introduce several ethical and regulatory challenges because they operate at a very personal level. Key concerns include data privacy, the potential for emotional dependency, and the impact of cultural biases in AI algorithms.

Legislation and Regulation

Regulations, such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, are evolving to address these challenges, imposing restrictions on certain AI applications like emotion recognition in workplaces and education. Regulators are faced with controversy and concerns by researchers and practitioners – but I urge stakeholders to proceed with speed as well as care.

Inter-institution Collaboration

A further point on collaboration. It’s disappointing to see that the majority of this potential and promise remains limited to the research lab. I think it’s time for greater synergy between industry and academia. The former can play its part by being more proactive in identifying commercial opportunities and ensuring that affective computing technologies are scalable and integrable into existing systems. Academia, meanwhile, can push harder on the boundaries of knowledge and technology, unconstrained as it is by immediate commercial or regulatory pressures.

Initiatives like joint research projects can lead to the development of robust tools and methodologies that are not only innovative but also practical for real-world applications. This is the way to ensuring that transformative affective computing technologies are both cutting-edge and viable for the market.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/en3anqff/ai-human-interaction_adobestock_1453361311.jpg?width=1002&height=564&v=1dbd6b4c3ffa510,N,,2025-06-06 11:17:30.601610

It was announced last month that Sir Mark would retire by the end of 2025, ending an eight-year tenure at the helm of the bank’s board.

His departure date comes after AIA confirmed his appointment as non-executive chairman on October 1 – a move that sees him return to the group he led as chief executive for seven years until 2017.

HSBC is still searching for his permanent replacement, but Brendan Nelson, head of the group’s audit committee, will take on the role on an interim basis.

Sir Mark will remain as a strategic adviser to the group’s chief executive Georges Elhedery and the board as the hunt for his successor continues.

Ann Godbehere, senior independent director who is leading the search, said the bank was “making progress” on the succession process.

On his appointment at AIA, Sir Mark said: “I am deeply honoured and excited to be taking on the role of independent chairman of one of the world’s largest insurance companies.

At the insurer, he replaces Edmund Sze-Wing Tse, who retires after a career spanning more than six decades with the business.

Sir Mark Tucker took on the role of chairman at HSBC in October 2017 and has been at the helm of one of the world’s biggest banks during crises including the Covid pandemic, the rising cost of living, and growing tensions between the US and China.

Under the leadership of Mr Elhedery, the bank is undergoing a major overhaul as it seeks to slash costs by 1.5 billion US dollars (£1.1 billion) by the end of 2026.

HSBC has also faced mounting pressure from one of its biggest shareholders, Chinese insurer Ping An, in recent years to split the bank in two and create a separate Asia-headquartered business.

A plan to break up the bank was rejected by shareholders last year, but the restructuring announcement initially prompted some speculation that it could eventually fracture.",https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/06/06/08/6223ffcc350fc26ff2511237adb298c0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQ5Mjc5Mzk1-2.73204446.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,N,,2025-06-06 12:16:24.754000

For the last nine months, these workers, along with grocery store workers in Washington state and California, have been in negotiations to end what they call a “chronic understaffing crisis” at grocery giants Albertsons Cos. and The Kroger Co., whose proposed merger ultimately failed.
The union cited workers’ opposition as “a critical part of a two-year effort that successfully blocked” the deal.
In Colorado, Safeway and Albertsons workers in metro Denver, Boulder, Broomfield, Castle Rock, Conifer, Evergreen, Fountain, Grand Junction, Idaho Springs, Parker, Pueblo, Salida, Steamboat Springs and Vail voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike, alleging such unfair labor practices (ULP) as disregarding a signed agreement for retroactive pay and benefit increases and offering only increases instead.
