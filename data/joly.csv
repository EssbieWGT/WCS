The brand’s highest-performing moment came via Enhypen, the South Korean K-pop group and Ralph Lauren global ambassadors.
“Ralph Lauren demonstrates how sustained commitment to a sport can translate into meaningful cultural equity,” said Jenny Tsai, founder and CEO of WeArisma.
The 2025 drop featured striped rugby knits, crest-emblazoned jackets and branded caps, sold through Ralph Lauren stores, e-commerce and select luxury retailers including Mytheresa-owned Mr Porter.
In her first 77 days as CEO of the British Fashion Council, Laura Weir has wasted no time diagnosing the industry’s pain points and attempting to fix them.","According to creator marketing platform WeArisma, fashion brands collectively generated $29.7 million in EMV during the June 1–July 14 tournament window. EMV is a metric that estimates the dollar value of exposure a brand receives through unpaid media, such as influencer posts, press coverage and social engagement. Ralph Lauren led all brands with $10.1 million, outpacing Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta by a wide margin. The brand was unreachable for comment.

The brand’s highest-performing moment came via Enhypen, the South Korean K-pop group and Ralph Lauren global ambassadors. Their Wimbledon-themed Instagram carousel — featuring their Ralph Lauren looks worn to both the All England Club, which hosts Wimbledon, and Ralph Lauren’s Bond Street flagship — drove $1.7 million in EMV and nearly 957,000 engagements.

Sachin Tendulkar, the former Indian cricket captain and global sports personality, followed with a post from the Club’s Royal Box, seated alongside Ralph Lauren executive David Lauren, ex-tennis player Pat Cash and British actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The post delivered $1.29 million in EMV and reached more than 50 million users.

Actress Sienna Miller drove $763,900 in EMV with her appearance in Ralph Lauren at the men’s final, while TikTok creator Tim Schaecker added another $276,200 with a preppy Wimbledon styling video aimed at the platform’s Gen-Z audience.

“Ralph Lauren demonstrates how sustained commitment to a sport can translate into meaningful cultural equity,” said Jenny Tsai, founder and CEO of WeArisma. “From collaborations with global stars to authentic moments that span generations, the brand has proven its ability to turn long-term partnerships into cultural momentum.”

Since becoming Wimbledon’s first official outfitter in 2006, Ralph Lauren has released annual limited-edition Wimbledon capsule collections that fuse British sporting tradition with American prep. The 2025 drop featured striped rugby knits, crest-emblazoned jackets and branded caps, sold through Ralph Lauren stores, e-commerce and select luxury retailers including Mytheresa-owned Mr Porter.

While EMV measures attention, it doesn’t always guarantee conversion. As i-D editor-in-chief Thom Bettridge recently pointed out in an Instagram Story referencing the Bezos wedding, millions in EMV can be misleading when audiences are just there to gawk – no one’s buying the bride’s look.

But Wimbledon is different. Fashion insiders and fans track what players wear through accounts like @thetennislookbook (54,000 followers on Instagram), and Substacks like The Tennis Edit, SportsVerse and Bigger Than Sports, which explore how tennis aesthetics influence fashion. On the June 14 episode of the Retail Therapy fashion podcast, host Will Defries admitted to buying Paul Mescal’s tie after discussing his Wimbledon look. In this case, EMV aligns with real demand: Ralph Lauren’s Wimbledon apparel sales rose 54% in 2024, according to All England Club retail head Daniel Ashmore. This year’s figure is still being counted.

Other brands that leaned into Wimbledon-fashion integrations included Kering-owned Gucci, which hosted a pre-tournament dinner at Claridge’s with ambassador Jannik Sinner and actors Paul Mescal and Joe Keery. The event drove $151,000 in EMV via British Vogue coverage, while Sinner winning the tournament also worked to Gucci’s advantage. Sinner famously brought a monogrammed Gucci duffle bag to Centre Court in 2022, marking a turning point in tennis fashion. It signaled the sport’s shift toward luxury branding and cemented Sinner as a global style ambassador.

LVMH’s Louis Vuitton outfitted ambassador and tennis player Carlos Alcaraz in custom tailoring. Styled by Pharrell Williams, Alcaraz wore Nike performance wear, a Rolex watch and LV branding for the men’s final on Centre Court on July 13. The athlete has been sponsored by Louis Vuitton since June 2023.

For its part, Bottega Veneta, under creative director Matthieu Blazy, partnered with Italian tennis player Lorenzo Musetti for a campaign that drove $1.6 million in EMV, with a single Vogue Instagram post generating $801,400. And Italian outerwear brand C.P. Company debuted a custom all-white look on player Mattia Bellucci, earning a 296% engagement rate, the highest of any brand at the tournament.

Fashion brands are not the only ones tapping, and building, Wimbledon’s link to luxury. British luxury travel and lifestyle brand Antler, founded in 1914, also used Wimbledon to sharpen its fashion positioning.

Antler’s 360-degree campaign included hosting a tennis-themed event at Berkshire hotel Oakley Court, gifting VIP and sponsoring British tennis player Julian Cash, who wore the brand and went on to win the men’s doubles final. The brand declined to share the sponsorship amount. As a result, Antler saw social engagement increase by more than 100%, compared to an average day, plus its reach grew by 62% and impressions rose by 34%. Website sessions from organic social traffic rose over 45% year-over-year, while press coverage surged by 187%.

“Wimbledon significantly enhanced our brand visibility and reinforced the positioning of our British heritage and summer capsule collection,” said Kirsty Glenne, managing director of the brand.

Antler’s “made in the UK” Heritage Tote Bag also gained visibility through partnerships. Actresses Emma Appleton, Millie Brady and Saffron Hocking carried the tote courtside, generating strong social and PR pickup. Their combined reach of over 1.29 million followers amplified the brand across fashion media, with placements in fashion publications including Who What Wear and Marie Claire.

“This activation did more than drive awareness. It cemented Antler’s status as a modern British lifestyle brand,” Glenne said.

Can new BFC CEO Laura Weir save London Fashion Week?

In her first 77 days as CEO of the British Fashion Council, Laura Weir has wasted no time diagnosing the industry’s pain points and attempting to fix them. “It is time to reset,” she said at the BFC’s annual summer gathering on July 14, before laying out a series of changes aimed at reversing London Fashion Week’s slide in global relevance.

The core of her plan addresses what many designers and industry observers have long critiqued: the lack of infrastructure and commercial support for emerging British talent. In February, Glossy reported that U.K. brands were increasingly skipping the runway altogether, citing dwindling sponsorships and rising costs. Designers including Chet Lo and Tolu Coker have moved their production elsewhere or focused on wholesale appointments in Paris, while the June London Fashion Week men’s showcase was scrapped in favor of a showroom across the Channel.

Weir’s headline announcement included waiving listing fees for designers physically showing their collections in September, directly targeting this challenge. “Fashion Week is a valuable piece of national IP and our shop window for what creative Britain looks like,” she said.

Designers are welcoming the shift. “Waiving the entry fee is a hugely welcomed move, especially in today’s climate where designers are balancing so many costs,” said Sabrinah Latoya, founder of Sabirah, a modest fashion label launched at LFW in 2020. “It’s encouraging to see the BFC recognizing this and responding. The U.K. is a hotbed of talent, and I am hoping the BFC will start working to build an industry that keeps us here.”

Additional moves by Meir have included tripling the funding commitment from the BFC’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport to the designer incubator Newgen program, doubling the guest program budget and launching the Fashion Assembly, an education initiative that will bring designers back to their former schools across the U.K. to inspire students. The guest program initiative invites and hosts key international industry stakeholders at LFW, including global press, buyers, influencers and cultural commentators. Exact financial figures were not disclosed. “Young people need to see the many pathways into fashion,” said Latoya. “This could be the spark that opens doors.”

While designers like Patrick McDowell also expressed optimism about the changes, the long-term success of Weir’s reset hinges on sustained funding and follow-through. In her speech, Weir called for industry-wide support. “Fashion gives us a preview of society’s next chapter,” she said. “It’s time to write a new story together.”

Executive moves

Marni has appointed Belgian designer Meryll Rogge, founder of her namesake label and former design lead at Dries Van Noten, as creative director, following Francesco Risso’s departure in June. No official date has been set for her first presentation.

Galeries Lafayette has appointed Guillaume Houzé as chief image and innovation officer after serving 11 years as director of image and communications; Emmanuelle Greth, formerly director of human resources and sustainable development, is now chief human resources and CSR officer; and Matthieu Caloni, previously head of finance, strategy and transformation since 2016, has been promoted to chief financial officer, replacing Ugo Supino, who stepped down in June after 25 years at the company.

News to know

A Milan court has placed the cashmere company Loro Piana under judicial administration due to allegations of labor exploitation by unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers. This prompted the LVMH-owned brand, led by new CEO Frédéric Arnault, to cut ties with the supplier within 24 hours and pledge full cooperation with authorities.

Macy’s is borrowing $500 million by selling new long-term bonds to help pay off older, due-soon debts and reduce its financial burden. Credit agency Fitch gave the new bonds a good rating, saying Macy’s is managing its money well, despite challenges like closing 150 stores and dealing with cautious shoppers.

French knitwear brand Molli has received a minority investment from LVMH Luxury Ventures, marking its first external funding since being revived in 2014 by CEO Charlotte de Fayet. The investment will go toward international expansion, new flagship stores, product innovation, and team growth. The brand is on track to surpass €10 million ($11.6 million) in annual sales.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced 30% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and the European Union starting August 1, via letters posted to social media platform Truth Social on July 13. He cited ongoing trade imbalances and border security concerns, despite prior negotiations proposing lower rates and warnings from E.U. leaders about potential economic fallout and retaliatory measures. The E.U. and U.S. share a significant trade relationship, with goods and services exchanged between them totaling €1.68 trillion (approximately $1.95 trillion) last year, accounting for nearly 30% of global trade in goods and services.

China’s economy expanded more than 5 percent in the second quarter, official data showed yesterday, buoyed by strong exports, but analysts said that more work was needed to address sluggish consumer demand.

The country’s GDP grew 5.2 percent year-on-year during the April-to-June quarter, matching a prediction by an Agence France-Presse survey of analysts and topping an official growth goal for the year set by the government.

However, it marked a slowdown from the first quarter’s 5.4 percent growth, which was boosted by exporters rushing to shift goods ahead of high US tariffs.

“The national economy withstood pressure and made steady improvement despite challenges,” National Bureau of Statistics Deputy Director Sheng Laiyun (盛來運) told a news conference in Beijing.

“Production and demand grew steadily, employment was generally stable, household income continued to increase, new growth drivers witnessed robust development and high-quality development made new strides,” he said.

Markets were mixed in response — after a strong start to the day, Hong Kong pared an early rally, while Shanghai dipped into negative territory.

“The figures probably still overstate the strength of growth,” Capital Economics economist Huang Zichun (黃子春) said in a note.

“With exports set to slow and the tailwind from fiscal support on course to fade, growth is likely to slow further during the second half of this year,” Huang added.

Retail sales rose 4.8 percent year-on-year last month, below a forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, suggesting efforts to kick-start consumption have fallen flat.

Meanwhile, factory output gained 6.8 percent, higher than the estimate — reflecting continued high demand for Chinese exports that has boosted growth.

However, analysts said that strong exports could be driving deflationary pressures and further dampening already sluggish consumer demand.

Data last week showed that consumer prices edged up last month, barely snapping a four-month deflationary dip, but factory gate prices dropped at their fastest clip in nearly two years.

“Recent efforts to boost spending, such as the broadening of the consumer goods trade-in scheme earlier this year, did temporarily lift retail sales,” Moody’s Analytics economist Sarah Tan said. “However, this support proved unsustainable, with funding reportedly drying up in several provinces. The scheme’s limitations highlight the need for policymakers to address the deeper structural challenges behind consumer caution.”",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/07/16/P09-250716-326.jpg,N,,2025-07-16 01:02:14.774005

Conclusion: A Resilient Bank in a Challenging Sector USB's Q2 results paint a picture of a bank that has mastered operational leverage in a tough environment.
Yet challenges loom: modest revenue growth, soft commercial real estate demand, and macro risks like trade disputes could limit upside.","As the U.S. economy grapples with persistent inflation, lingering trade tensions, and a Federal Reserve poised to recalibrate monetary policy, banks face a delicate balancing act: sustaining revenue growth while maintaining asset quality and operational discipline. U.S. Bancorp's (USB) upcoming Q2 2025 earnings report offers a critical lens through which to assess its ability to navigate these headwinds. Let's dissect the key drivers of its performance and evaluate whether its valuation and fundamentals justify a “buy” or “hold” ahead of the results.

Net Interest Income: A Steady Pillar Amid Volatility

USB's net interest income (NII) is projected to reach $4.1–$4.2 billion for Q2, slightly above consensus estimates and a modest sequential increase. This resilience is notable given the Fed's rate cuts in 2024, which typically compress net interest margins. Management's success in stabilizing interest rates and reducing funding costs has been pivotal. However, the broader banking sector faces challenges: JPMorgan's Q2 revenues dropped 10.5%, while Citigroup grew by a more modest 8%.

USB's NII growth, while not explosive, reflects a disciplined approach to asset-liability management. This consistency positions it as a relative outperformer in a sector marked by uneven results.

Non-Interest Income: A Diversified Engine of Growth

The real story lies in USB's non-interest income, which is forecasted to rise 3.3% sequentially to $2.93 billion. Key contributors include:

- Card Services: Up 9.9% to $437 million, driven by robust consumer spending and digital adoption.

- Commercial Lending: Commercial product revenue grew 2.4% to $391 million, reflecting strong demand for C&I loans.

- Trust and Investment Management: Steady at $686 million, highlighting the durability of wealth management services.

These figures underscore USB's success in diversifying revenue streams—a critical hedge against a flattening yield curve. Peer comparisons are instructive: Citigroup's revenue growth has been buoyed by similar strategies, while JPMorgan's struggles highlight the risks of overexposure to volatile markets.

Expense Management: The Efficiency Ratio as a Gauge of Discipline

USB's efficiency ratio—projected to fall to 59.1% in Q2 from 61.0% a year ago—signals improved operational rigor. This metric, which measures non-interest expenses relative to revenue, has been a persistent pain point for many banks amid rising compensation costs and technological investments. USB's ability to keep this ratio below 60% while peers like JPMorgan and Bank of America hover closer to 65% reflects a culture of cost discipline.

This trend is not merely a numbers game; it's a testament to management's focus on scalability.

Asset Quality: Navigating a Riskier Landscape

While USB's non-performing loans (NPLs) edged up 1.8% sequentially to $1.72 billion, they remain 4.9% below year-ago levels. Similarly, non-performing assets (NPAs) dipped 5.4% annually. These metrics suggest a stable credit environment, though the slight quarterly uptick warrants attention. The bank's conservative underwriting and focus on commercial lending—less prone to real estate or consumer defaults—appear to be paying dividends.

Valuation and Market Context: A Hold with Upside Potential

USB's stock has risen 9.7% over the past month, outperforming the S&P 500 but lagging peers like Citigroup (up 8%). The Zacks Rank #3 (“Hold”) and an average analyst price target of $52.83 suggest caution, especially given the macroeconomic fog. However, if USB beats its EPS estimate of $1.07—a likelihood given its 2.5% historical beat rate—the stock could test its target.

Conclusion: A Resilient Bank in a Challenging Sector

USB's Q2 results paint a picture of a bank that has mastered operational leverage in a tough environment. Its steady NII, diversified non-interest income, and improving efficiency ratio form a solid foundation. Yet challenges loom: modest revenue growth, soft commercial real estate demand, and macro risks like trade disputes could limit upside.

Investors should consider USB a “hold” for now, with a tilt toward “buy” if earnings exceed expectations and the Fed signals a pause in rate hikes.

While revenue surged 11.4% year-over-year to $48.13 billion—driven by strategic acquisitions and Medicare Advantage (MA) expansion—profitability faced significant headwinds. The medical cost ratio climbed to 88.4%, eroding margins, while operational expenses and Medicaid membership declines added to the strain. Investors now face a critical question: Does the stock's current valuation justify the risks, or should they pivot to peers like CVS (CVS) or Boston Scientific (BSX) for safer upside?

The Revenue Boost: Acquisitions and MA Momentum

Elevance's growth narrative hinges on two pillars: acquisitions and MA penetration. The CarelonRx pharmacy venture and premium commercial individual plans fueled the top line, while MA membership rose 12.4% year-over-year, offsetting a 135,000-member Medicaid decline. Total medical membership held steady at 45.8 million, a testament to the company's ability to navigate post-pandemic eligibility redeterminations in Medicaid.

The Margin Squeeze: Costs Outpacing Revenue

Despite the revenue gains, profitability faltered. The medical cost ratio hit 88.4%, up from 86.3% in Q2 2024, reflecting rising healthcare utilization and inflation in prescription drugs and home health services. Operational costs, including investments in digital infrastructure and interest expenses, rose 11% YoY. These pressures dragged adjusted EPS down 9.1% to $9.20, and Health Benefits segment operating income fell 12.4% amid Medicaid losses.

The Carelon Divide: Growth vs. Profitability

The Carelon division, now a core part of Elevance's strategy, reported a 14.1% YoY rise in operating income, underscoring its potential as a margin stabilizer. However, its success contrasts with broader margin pressures in other segments. The question remains: Can Carelon's expansion—leveraging pharmacy and home health integration—offset systemic cost inflation? Early signs are mixed, as Elevance's forward P/E of 14.2x already reflects skepticism about near-term margin recovery.

Valuation and Analyst Sentiment: A Neutral Stance

Elevance's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00% signal little optimism about near-term upside. While the company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $32.85+, it remains below 2024 levels. Analysts recommend holding shares only if investors believe Carelon's scalability and MA growth can eventually outweigh Medicaid volatility.

Peer Comparison: Why CVS and BSX Look Safer

Compared to peers, Elevance faces heightened risks. CVS, with its pharmacy and health plan synergies, boasts stronger beat probabilities and less exposure to Medicaid fluctuations. Boston Scientific, meanwhile, benefits from medical device demand and lower margin sensitivity to healthcare inflation. Both trade with Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy), offering more favorable risk-reward profiles.

Investment Implications: Hold for Now

Investors should maintain a cautious stance on Elevance. The stock's 71.43% win rate over 10 days post-earnings suggests near-term resilience, but the pending False Claims Act lawsuit and potential MA industry slowdown loom large. Until Elevance demonstrates margin stabilization—through Medicaid membership recovery or Carelon's profitability—peers like CVS and BSX offer safer alternatives.

For bulls, the 1.01% maximum return on day 58 post-earnings hints at potential, but the path to higher EPS is fraught. A “hold” rating aligns with current fundamentals: Elevance is a core holding for those betting on long-term MA growth but a risky choice in an era of cost-driven healthcare challenges.

In conclusion, Elevance's earnings reveal a company at a crossroads—balanced between the promise of strategic growth and the perils of rising costs. Until the latter is tamed, investors may want to look elsewhere for safer bets.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-16 02:02:00.006666

Customer preferences have shifted, the company said in a statement, noting that it would now focus on a vegetarian patty made from vegetables.

The move signals a contraction in the fast-food chain’s plant-based ambitions in Europe, despite an initial wave of enthusiasm when the McPlant first launched five years ago. The burger, created in partnership with Beyond Meat, marked a symbolic step into meatless territory for the golden arches.

McDonald’s UK

McDonald’s has offered no indication that it will revisit its vegan menu development in Austria. Meanwhile, rivals such as Burger King have doubled down on their plant-based strategies, including fully meat-free pop-up locations and the ability to customize most of its burgers as vegan in numerous markets. McDonald’s still serves some McPlant products in countries including Germany, the UK, and France, but the scaling back in Austria raises fresh questions about the future of the category, especially in the US, where the McPlant was discontinued in 2022 after a brief and disappointing trial.

A short-lived American experiment

The McPlant’s US rollout began in 2021 with limited tests in eight stores and then expanded to roughly 600 locations across California and Texas by early 2022. Marketed as a collaboration with Beyond Meat, the launch was widely viewed as McDonald’s entrance into the plant-based burger race. But instead of igniting demand, the McPlant fizzled. According to internal reports cited by Reuters, some restaurants were selling as few as three burgers per day.

Joe Erlinger, President of McDonald’s USA, later acknowledged the effort had not worked. “It was not successful in either market,” he told Food & Wine.

“I don’t think the US consumer is coming to McDonald’s or looking for a McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald’s now.”

And yet, despite its retreat in Austria and collapse in the US, the McPlant is still alive in select international markets. The UK and Ireland offer fully vegan versions, complete with vegan cheese and dairy-free sauces. France and Germany also continue to serve the burger, and Germany recently added plant-based McNuggets.

Part of the product’s endurance abroad comes down to infrastructure and consumer readiness. European customers are often more accustomed to meat alternatives, and governments have introduced policies that encourage a shift toward climate-conscious diets. In Germany, where beef prices have risen 50 percent since the pandemic, the economic equation also makes plant-based meals more attractive.

Beyond the burger: fast food’s changing appetite

Beyond Meat continued to supply the McDonald’s patty, but the contract between the two companies has since expired. Reports suggest McDonald’s did not renew the agreement, instead shifting its innovation focus elsewhere, primarily to chicken, which now accounts for half of its US sales.

But the McPlant’s lackluster reception reveals deeper tensions around the plant-based fast-food space. Although the number of Americans experimenting with meatless eating continues to grow—nearly 71 percent had tried plant-based alternatives as of 2021, according to recent findings—price and perception still act as major barriers. At McDonald’s, known for affordability and speed, the McPlant was both more expensive and slower to serve.

There is also a branding contradiction that proved difficult to resolve. Consumers view McDonald’s as the epitome of mass-market meat. Selling a faux-meat burger without a clear break from that identity made the McPlant hard to position authentically for either vegans or omnivores.

In the bigger picture, the fast food sector is undergoing shifts driven by both economic pressure and changing public tastes. While the sector continues to grow globally, factors like dietary preferences and inflation continue to shape menus and pricing.

McDonald’s in particular is grappling with its steepest US sales decline since the pandemic, with same-store sales dropping 3.6 percent in early 2025 and overall traffic down across low- and middle-income brackets. Inflation, tariff fears, and changing appetites have pushed the chain to roll out deep discounts like its $5 Meal Deal, while shuttering experimental concepts like CosMc’s in an attempt to re-center its core business. Globally, sales dipped 1 percent, and though some international markets like China and Japan posted gains, the broader slowdown suggests that McDonald’s—and the fast-food sector at large—is facing a recalibration moment, one shaped as much by consumer fatigue with ultra-processed food as by economic pressure.

At the same time, processed food is facing increasing scrutiny. A 2024 NielsenIQ report showed that 52 percent of US consumers are actively trying to avoid highly processed foods, even if plant-based. This may explain why some consumers prefer whole-food vegetarian options instead, especially in international markets where clean labels are prioritized.

The appetite for plant-based fast food isn’t gone, although, it is evolving. Consumers appear more interested in vegetable-forward formats, meatless nuggets, or hybrid proteins than simply replicating burgers. For companies like McDonald’s, the challenge now is finding where those preferences meet operational feasibility.",https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjM0NzYwL1ZlZ05ld3MuRG91YmxlTWNQbGFudC5NY0RvbmFsZHNVSy5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjcm9wX3Jlc2l6ZWQiLCIxNTk3eDgzOCsxKzEwNyIsIjEyMDB4NjMwXiIseyJmb3JtYXQiOiJqcGcifV0sWyJwIiwib3B0aW1pemUiXV0/VegNews.DoubleMcPlant.McDonaldsUK.jpg?sha=deb9e4d66912d856,N,,2025-07-16 01:02:08.633372

On July 15, HM Treasury released the UK Green Taxonomy Consultation Response, outlining the results and ending the drive to the creation of the regulation.
Additionally, the creation of sustainability reporting standards through the FCA Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and UK Sustainability Reporting Standards will address those claims made in financial documents.","On July 15, HM Treasury announced that the United Kingdom will be abandoning plans to create a UK Green Taxonomy. The move shocked sustainability advocates and comes at a time when the European Union and other jurisdictions reexamine existing sustainability regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and shifting towards net zero.

In October 2024, the UK government published a green paper setting net zero transition and green energy as a priority. The consultation on the need for a UK Green Taxonomy followed in November. The consultation stated that the UK aims to be the world leader in sustainable finance, including “delivering a regulatory framework to support sustainable growth and enable the private sector to realise the opportunities of the transition.”

The consultation defined a taxonomy as ""a classification tool which provides its users with a common framework to define which economic activities support climate, environmental or wider sustainability objectives. The purpose of developing a taxonomy for sustainable activities is typically to facilitate an increase in sustainable investment, and/or to reduce greenwashing, including by providing a reference point for other policies.”

The consultation closed in February. On July 15, HM Treasury released the UK Green Taxonomy Consultation Response, outlining the results and ending the drive to the creation of the regulation.

The first sentence of the response demonstrated the political shift within the UK on this issue. “Growth is the number one mission of this government and sustainable finance can be a key driver of that growth.” This is different from the language of the consultation that called sustainability “essential for long-term economic growth.” While the change may be subtle, it is significant.

HM Treasury received only 150 responses to the consultation. 45% of the respondents were in favor of a taxonomy, while 55% were opposed or mixed. “The concern largely centred around the real-world application of this policy, primarily driven out of experience of working with other taxonomies, and concerns on the extent to which taxonomies were delivering on desired objectives.”

This observation relating to other taxonomies is not only timely, as the European Commission is working on reducing the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, but is also reflective of the larger pushback on the effectiveness of sustainability regulations. As the effects and cost of these new regulations become real, business interests are resisting the proposals. Even climate activists are questioning their effectiveness, as reporting standards disclose information without requiring actual action to reduce GHG emissions.

The consultation looked at two main areas of focus. The first addressed whether a taxonomy could help channel money into the net zero transition. “The hypothesis behind many taxonomies is that it is difficult to identify credible, sustainable investment opportunities and that a UK Taxonomy could improve clarity about what activities are ‘green’ so that investors could confidently compare financial products and deploy capital towards sustainable goals.”

The responses were split by industry, with representatives of the energy, nuclear, and waste sectors saying that the taxonomy would help reach this goal. Respondents from the “real economy” disagreed and ""viewed a UK Taxonomy as a classification tool that could serve as an additional data point among various factors considered when making investment decisions. However, it was unlikely to have a material impact on final investment decisions.""

The second area of focus looked at greenwashing, or misleading claims made by companies so they look more environmentally friendly. The taxonomy was aimed at reducing greenwashing ""based on the hypothesis that activity level data could help to verify green and sustainability claims in the absence of a clear framework, and that a taxonomy could be the solution by definitively setting out what activities are ‘green’.”

However, respondents disagreed and felt that the creation of a UK Taxonomy would lead to more fragmentation and confusion. It was argued that this is best handled through existing regulators, like the Competition Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority. This is the approach recently adopted in Canada. Additionally, the creation of sustainability reporting standards through the FCA Sustainability Disclosure Requirements and UK Sustainability Reporting Standards will address those claims made in financial documents.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68617289897abb0d9e40623b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-16 00:00:12.181049

In a major company-wide shift announced Monday, CEO Brian Niccol stated that starting in October, employees at the company’s Seattle and Toronto support centers will be required to work in the office four days a week.

The new mandate requires corporate staff to be at their assigned desks from Monday through Thursday, a significant increase from the previous three-day-a-week policy. In an open letter to employees, Niccol justified the move as a crucial step in the coffee giant’s ongoing turnaround effort.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said. “We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

Recognizing the new policy may not work for everyone, Starbucks is offering a one-time voluntary exit package with a cash payment for those who opt out of returning to the office four days a week.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,” Niccol’s letter continued. “We’ve listened and thought carefully. But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

However, the strict in-office mandate for employees comes into sharp contrast with the arrangements detailed in Niccol’s own employment contract. When he became CEO in September 2024, his offer letter stated he would not be required to relocate to the Seattle support center.

The contract revealed he would live in Newport Beach, California, and commute to Starbucks’ head office 1,000 miles away on a corporate jet. A recent CNBC report noted that Niccol—who also has a home and office in Seattle—now “defaults to in-person work in Seattle when he isn’t traveling.”

Developed by Aspire Impact in collaboration with Aspire Circle, the framework was unveiled in New Delhi and co-authored by 15 leading figures from across the healthcare value chain — including Fortis, Apollo, Cipla, Zydus, Sun Pharma, Redcliffe Labs, Quadria Capital, HealthQuad, and Tata Capital Healthcare Fund.

Titled Healthcare: An ESG Performance Framework, the publication is part of Aspire’s Capgemini-supported Impact Future Project and offers a structured roadmap for evaluating ESG performance in a sector expected to reach USD 596 billion by 2025.

Despite its scale and critical role in public health, India’s healthcare sector comprises only 6 percent of the market capitalization of the top 1,000 NSE-listed companies, highlighting an urgent need for standardized ESG benchmarks to guide responsible investment.

Its a dual-rating system that separately assesses ESG risks and opportunities. It introduces 80 sector-agnostic and 27 sector-specific indicators to help stakeholders measure everything from biomedical waste management and antimicrobial resistance to green hospital infrastructure, ethical supply chains, and digital health adoption.

The framework also features impact-oriented metrics such as WHO medicine prequalification, access to government health schemes, and AMR management systems.

Amit Bhatia, Founder of Aspire Impact and Aspire Circle, described the framework as a catalyst for change in a sector that now needs to move beyond compliance.

“India’s $310 billion healthcare and pharma sector can lead the world not just in treating illnesses, but in addressing social and environmental risks. Our ESG framework introduces measurable, comparable benchmarks that enable ethical, inclusive, and future-ready growth,” he said.

From an investment perspective, the launch marks a shift toward data-driven ESG evaluation that goes beyond narrative sustainability claims.

“For investors and operators alike, this framework fills a critical gap. It empowers the entire ecosystem to act with greater confidence and accountability,” said Rahul Agarwal, Partner, HealthQuad.

Anurag Pratap, CSR Leader,Capgemini India’s emphasising the framework also has a wider societal impact,said, “India’s healthcare sector is growing rapidly, but growth without responsibility is a missed opportunity.

This framework brings clarity to ESG efforts and enables institutions to align patient care with climate action, equitable access, and long-term resilience.”

The framework is the third in a 12-part series released by Aspire Impact, with earlier reports focusing on core ESG KPIs and the financial services sector. Aspire also announced plans to launch IKOOWorld, a digital platform aimed at enabling both self-guided and assured ESG assessments.

As India’s healthcare ecosystem continues to digitise, scale, and diversify, this new ESG framework is expected to play a key role in shaping the future of sustainable healthcare investment, offering both accountability and ambition in equal measure.

Investors seeking a healthcare play with growth and stability should consider Elevance—but brace for volatility as the industry's cost crisis unfolds.
Final recommendation: Hold Elevance for its diversified strengths, but monitor margin trends and legal outcomes closely.","Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) is set to release its Q2 2025 earnings on July 17, marking it the first major insurer to report amid sector-wide cost pressures. With revenue projected to surge 11.4% year-over-year to $48.13 billion, the company's results will be closely watched as a bellwether for an industry grappling with rising medical costs and regulatory headwinds. But can Elevance's diversified business model—spanning insurance, pharmacy, and home health—position it as a resilient investment play compared to peers like UnitedHealth Group (UNH)? Let's dig into the data.

The Revenue Engine: Growth Amid Pressure

Elevance's top-line momentum is undeniable. The company's strategic acquisitions, particularly in its CarelonRx pharmacy division and home health services, have driven robust revenue streams. The Carelon segment's operating income is expected to jump 14.1% year-over-year, fueled by prescription drug sales and value-based care contracts. Meanwhile, Medicare Advantage (MA) membership grew 12.4% in Q1 2025, offsetting Medicaid declines.

Yet, this growth comes at a cost. The medical cost ratio—the proportion of revenue spent on benefits—has surged to 88.4%, up from 86.3% in Q2 2024. This inflation in healthcare utilization, particularly in home health and prescription drugs, is squeezing margins. Operating income for Elevance's core Health Benefits segment is projected to fall 12.4% year-over-year, a stark contrast to Carelon's expansion.

The Diversification Advantage

Elevance's strategy diverges sharply from UnitedHealth, which reported a 25% Q2 EPS drop due to soaring MA costs and reimbursement cuts. While UNH's Optum division (accounting for over 50% of revenue) undergoes a costly turnaround, Elevance's Carelon division is a growth engine, not a drag.

The key differentiator? Elevance's balanced revenue streams. While 60% of its revenue still comes from insurance, the remaining 40% is increasingly non-insurance: Carelon's pharmacy and home health services, digital health platforms like Sydney Health, and supplemental benefits programs. This diversification reduces reliance on volatile government programs like Medicaid, which saw membership drop 135,000 in Q2.

Legal and Regulatory Risks: Navigating the Storm

Both companies face legal challenges. Elevance is battling a securities fraud lawsuit alleging insufficient disclosure of Medicaid risks, while UnitedHealth grapples with a Medicare fraud investigation that could result in fines or operational restrictions.

Elevance's risk here is twofold: a potential valuation hit if the lawsuit drags on and enrollment disruptions if Medicaid members flee. However, the company's 60% re-enrollment rate among Medicaid-eligible users using its digital tools hints at resilience. UnitedHealth's issues, meanwhile, are deeper: its Optum division's cost overruns and CMS reimbursement cuts to MA plans (via the V28 rule) could prolong margin pain.

Valuation: A Discounted Play?

Elevance trades at a 14.2x forward P/E, below its five-year average of 15.6x and slightly cheaper than UnitedHealth's 12–13.7x multiple. However, Elevance's long-term growth trajectory—projected revenue of $272 billion by 2029—gives it a potential edge. Analysts see a 4.1% EPS rise in 2025, while UnitedHealth's EPS is expected to rebound only in .

Investment Thesis: Hold for the Long Game?

Elevance is not without risks. Its margins face acute sensitivity to healthcare cost trends—a 1% rise in the benefit ratio could slash EPS by $0.37. Yet, its diversified model offers a buffer. Carelon's scalability, MA's steady growth, and digital tools to retain Medicaid members position it better than peers reliant on single revenue streams.

For investors, Elevance's valuation and 2.9% dividend yield (vs. UnitedHealth's 1.6%) make it a compelling “hold” play. The stock's historical performance—71% win rate over 10 days post-earnings—supports a wait-and-see approach.

Conclusion: Resilience Requires Patience

Elevance Health's Q2 results will test its ability to navigate margin pressures while capitalizing on Carelon's growth. While short-term risks like legal battles and Medicaid volatility linger, the company's diversification and long-term strategies suggest it could outperform peers like UnitedHealth in a cost-driven sector. Investors seeking a healthcare play with growth and stability should consider Elevance—but brace for volatility as the industry's cost crisis unfolds.

""Overall U.S. beer production and imports were down 1% in 2024, while craft brewer volume sales declined by 4%, slightly reducing small and independent brewers’ share of the U.S. beer market by volume to 13.3%,"" according to data from the National Brewer's Association.

Declining beer sales are not just an American thing. Canada, which has a strong reputation as a beer-drinking nation, has seen a drop in liquor consumption overall.

""Liquor authorities and other retail outlets sold $26.2 billion worth of alcoholic beverages in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, down 0.1% from fiscal year 2022/2023.

The drop in sales, however, is alarming for those in the industry.

""On a volume basis, sales of alcohol declined by 3.8% to 2,988 million litres in 2023/2024. This was the largest volume decline ever recorded since Statistics Canada began tracking alcohol sales in 1949. On average, Canadians of legal drinking age purchased the equivalent of 8.7 standard alcoholic beverages per week in 2023/2024, down from 9.2 the previous fiscal year,"" it added.

Canada is drinking less beer, too

In the United States, the drop in beer sales, along with high debt levels due to the Covid-era shutdowns, have forced dozens of local and regional breweries to close. Many of these companies were only marginally good businesses before the pandemic, making even a small drop in business, amid increased expenses, impossible to survive.

Beer sales have dropped in Canada as well.

""By volume, beer sales declined 4.5% to 1,950 million litres in 2023/2024, a record decrease since Statistics Canada began tracking alcohol sales in 1949. The 2023/2024 fiscal year marks the eighth consecutive annual decline in beer sales by volume. Beer sales were equivalent to 3.4 standard bottles of beer per week, per person of legal drinking age,"" according to the Canadian government.

That drop, along with a government decision expanding alcohol sales to more stores in Ontario, has caused Canada's own version of the Beerpocalypse.

The slowdown in sales has also damaged another Canadian institution, The Beer Store.

While Americans may not know ""The Beer Store,"" the nearly 100-year-old chain is a Canadian institution.

As a customer, you can choose from a multitude of beer brands from brewers around the world,"" the chain shared on its website.

The changing economics of the industry and the increased competition from new stores selling alcohol has forced the chain to get steadily smaller. It has already closed around 50 stores this year and has just shared plans to close another 10 locations.

“Closing a retail store is never an easy decision — our stores and employees contribute to communities in many ways and provide easy access to empty returns throughout Ontario,” said The Beer Store Retail Vice President Ozzie Ahmed. “We are modernizing operations and focusing on what we do best, selling ice cold beer, great customer service, and a world-leading recycling system that gets customers their deposit money back.”

The 10 impacted locations will close on August 24.

The Beer Store has been a major player in the recycling of beer cans and bottles. The chain encourages customers to keep bringing empties back to the chain's remaining locations.

The U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends for the Food and Drug Administration to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes in the nation’s food supply.

As a result, a group of 40 ice cream producers, including Turkey Hill and Schwoeppe Dairy, have pledged to remove Red No. 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 by the end of 2027, according to the International Dairy Foods Association. The group accounts for more than 90 percent of the ice cream sold in the U.S.

The pledge to remove food dyes will only be applied to ice creams that are made with dairy milk and are sold at grocery stores, convenience stores, and online retailers.

Ice creams made with non-dairy ingredients and small businesses that make their own ice cream will not be included, according to the International Dairy Foods Association.

The Trump administration has led the move to eliminate synthetic dyes from the food supply by the end of next year, saying it could mark a “major step forward” in the drive to “Make America Healthy Again.” The ban would impact products such as breakfast cereals, candy, and snacks. The dyes have been tied to neurological problems in some children.

“For too long, some food producers have been feeding Americans petroleum-based chemicals without their knowledge or consent,” Kennedy said in a statement back in February. “These poisonous compounds offer no nutritional benefit and pose real, measurable dangers to our children’s health and development.”

He added: “We’re restoring gold-standard science, applying common sense, and beginning to earn back the public’s trust. And, we’re doing it by working with industry to get these toxic dyes out of the foods our families eat every day.”

At a cabinet meeting at the beginning of April, Kennedy claimed the dyes directly affect “academic performance, violence in the schools, and mental health, as well as physical health.”

In addition to ice cream, Kraft Heinz, the maker of Jell-O, Kool-Aid, and boxed macaroni and cheese, also announced last month that it would remove all chemical dyes from its products by the end of 2027.

The company stated that, while 90 percent of its U.S. products measured by sales are already free of artificial dyes, it will not use any Food, Drug & Cosmetic colors in any new products moving forward.

Kraft Heinz said that for the small number of their products that still contain artificial colors, they plan to remove the dyes where they are not critical, replace them with natural colors, or, in instances where the color isn’t critical to the product, they would remove them entirely.

While many products will not be impacted, some that may see changes include Crystal Light, Heinz relish, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Jet-Puffed, as they contain dyes such as Red No. 40 and Blue No. 1.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/12/12/Food-Salted_Malted_Chocolate_Chip_Dough_32668.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-07-15 23:05:00.303726

France, the UK, Italy and Spain all posted double-digit sales growth.","Levi Strauss is riding a fresh wave of momentum, posting a 9% increase in like-for-like sales for the first half of its 2025 financial year. Building on that growth, the denim giant now expects full-year sales to rise by 1% to 2%.

But according to CEO Michelle Gass, the results reflect more than a temporary boost—they validate the vision and restructuring she has led since taking the helm in 2023. Under her leadership, Levi’s has made bold moves, including divesting its Denizen brand in Asia, exiting its footwear division, and selling , the iconic chinos label. The company’s “Project Fuel” transformation plan, launched in early 2024, also included a major reorganization of its regional headquarters.

These decisions align with Gass’s broader ambition to turn Levi’s into a global lifestyle brand rooted in denim, with a direct-to-consumer focus. “The brand has never been stronger, and that’s thanks to a combination of things,” Gass told analysts during a recent earnings call. “We have a rich heritage, but you have to earn that relevance every day. That means showing up wherever the consumer is—on social media, in music, at cultural events, through Beyoncé or Shaboozey’s wardrobe.”

The Beyoncé partnership, linked to her “Cowboy Carter” album and tour, is a powerful example of how Levi’s continues to blend culture and commerce.

“This quarter, we launched the third chapter of our ‘Reiimagine’ campaign with Beyoncé, recreating a classic Levi’s ad from the archives,” Gass said. “We rolled out a limited-edition product line and worked directly with her team through our House of Strauss platform to design exclusive, custom looks for her tour. Staying deeply connected to music culture remains a pillar of our marketing strategy.”

Levi’s music push doesn’t end there. In Europe, the brand recently partnered with Barcelona’s Primavera Sound festival, launching a capsule collection and branding three performance stages. It also released a special-edition collection in tribute to the legendary British band .

Still, Gass is quick to point out that Levi’s rebound isn’t built on celebrity campaigns alone—particularly in Europe, where sales rose 15% year over year on a like-for-like basis. “Last month, I visited key cities like Paris, Barcelona and Milan.

The annexation would mean Polaris would have to pay a three-percent tax to the city, the company says it hasn’t budgeted for.
CITY RESPONSE The City of Muskogee sent News On 6 this statement: “The City of Muskogee values Polaris Technologies’ investment in our community and recognizes the company’s role in supporting technological growth and creating jobs in our region.
Bringing commercial properties into the city limits ensures all who benefit from city infrastructure and resources contribute their fair share.
The City of Muskogee appreciates the contributions Polaris has made and remains committed to policies that promote business success while upholding transparency, fairness, and responsible stewardship of public resources.”","A business is battling with Muskogee over the city’s plan to annex its property.

Polaris Technologies has been operating south of Muskogee for two years, and it says it was never told the annexation would happen.

The City says the plan has been in the works for more than a decade.

ANNEXATION QUESTION

This was all discussed at a special city council meeting Monday, where no action was taken.

The annexation would mean Polaris would have to pay a three-percent tax to the city, the company says it hasn’t budgeted for.

""They throw around three percent like three percent is a sales tax that is a few hundred dollars,” said Dan Chepkauskas, a Spokesman for Polaris. “No, it's millions of dollars, and by Phase Four, it's tens of millions of dollars.""

He says the company was never told about the plan to annex and wishes the city would work with it to find a plan that works for everyone, since the company is already here.

""We're not trying to fight the annexation per se,” said Chepkauskas. “We don't think it's necessarily right, but it is what it is. We want to be a community partner, and as a community partner, we would like to sit down with you and discuss what are the implications, what can we absorb and what can we not absorb.""

CITY RESPONSE

The City of Muskogee sent News On 6 this statement:

“The City of Muskogee values Polaris Technologies’ investment in our community and recognizes the company’s role in supporting technological growth and creating jobs in our region. Since their arrival, Polaris has been welcomed as a key partner in Muskogee’s economic development. At the same time, the City’s priority is to create a level playing field for all businesses while ensuring taxpayers are not subsidizing growth without the ability to plan or invest accordingly.

Recent public statements by Polaris mischaracterize the City Council’s actions regarding annexation. The annexation process, currently underway, is part of a long-standing policy objective to bring John T. Griffin Industrial Park development areas, many of which benefits from city infrastructure and services, into alignment with city boundaries. This is not about targeting any single company. It is about fairness, consistency in governance, and ensuring sustainable growth that benefits the entire community. The City’s priority remains clear: to foster economic development in a way that is equitable and allows for sound fiscal planning.

It is important to clarify that the annexation process has been conducted transparently and in accordance with Oklahoma law, with ample public notice and opportunities for input. Bringing commercial properties into the city limits ensures all who benefit from city infrastructure and resources contribute their fair share. This approach not only strengthens Muskogee’s ability to support future development but also safeguards long-term service delivery and infrastructure investment for all residents and businesses.

The City of Muskogee appreciates the contributions Polaris has made and remains committed to policies that promote business success while upholding transparency, fairness, and responsible stewardship of public resources.”",https://fueltools-prod01-public.fuelmedia.io/91fa9954-d7e6-483b-9fc0-19e5940628a5/20250715/5d8defd8-a662-4dce-bab7-3a565ee2ce43/thumbnail.png,N,,2025-07-15 21:01:04.339368

The long-acting drug, injected every two months, earned an FDA approval in 2021 under the brand name Apretude as a single agent for HIV prevention.
The MPP licensing deal allows generic drugmakers Aurobindo, Cipla and Viatris to produce and supply their version of the treatment to all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as those in the world classified as low-income and lower-middle-income.

The adjustment comes a week after the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its guidance, recommending the long-acting injectable combo treatment of Cabenuva, or cabotegravir and rilpivirine, as an alternative to daily oral therapy for patients who are virally suppressed.

Rilpivirine, which was developed by Johnson & Johnson and is known commercially in its oral formulation as Edurant, was approved by the FDA as an HIV treatment in 2011 and already has generic versions available outside the U.S.

“This step is closely aligned with WHO’s new recommendation of long-acting injectable antiretrovirals as an alternative for people who are virologically suppressed but face adherence challenges with daily oral regimens,” Meg Doherty, the director of the WHO’s global HIV, hepatitis and STI programs, said in a release.

The agreement comes on top of a licensing deal in 2022, which allowed specified generic drugmakers to produce their versions of cabotegravir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The long-acting drug, injected every two months, earned an FDA approval in 2021 under the brand name Apretude as a single agent for HIV prevention.

The MPP licensing deal allows generic drugmakers Aurobindo, Cipla and Viatris to produce and supply their version of the treatment to all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as those in the world classified as low-income and lower-middle-income. The deal covers 133 nations.

“Expanding access to long-acting options like this supports a more person-centered, choice- and needs-driven approach, which is exactly what an equitable and effective HIV response requires,” Charles Gore, the executive director of the MPP, added in a release.

The agreement comes a week after Gilead signed on to provide its newly approved long-acting, injected PrEP drug Yeztugo at a not-for-profit rate to poorer nations around the world. The deal was struck with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and is designed to provide coverage for up to 2 million people over three years.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s recent earnings call reflected a robust performance, marked by strong revenue growth and positive operating leverage. Despite facing challenges in the investment management segment and a projected moderation in deposit growth, the overall sentiment remained optimistic, with a continued focus on innovation and client engagement.

Strong Earnings Growth

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation reported impressive earnings growth, with earnings per share reaching $1.93, marking a 27% increase year over year. Total revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time in a quarter, representing a 9% year-over-year increase. This robust financial performance underscores the company’s ability to generate significant shareholder value.

Positive Operating Leverage

The company achieved approximately 500 basis points of positive operating leverage, both on reported and operating bases. With a pretax margin of 37% and a return on tangible common equity of 28%, BNY Mellon demonstrated strong operational efficiency and profitability.

Record Sales and Client Engagement

BNY Mellon achieved a second consecutive quarter of record sales, highlighting its success in expanding client relationships. The growth in multiproduct relationships, exemplified by the expanded partnership with UK asset manager LionTrust, showcases the company’s commitment to enhancing client engagement.

Advancements in Digital Assets

The company made significant strides in digital assets, being selected as the reserve custodian for Societe Generale’s first USD stablecoin in Europe and as the primary custodian of Ripple’s US stablecoin reserves. These advancements position BNY Mellon at the forefront of the digital asset space.

Robust Fee Revenue Growth

Fee revenue increased by 7%, driven by net new business, client activity, and higher market values. This growth in fee revenue highlights the company’s ability to capitalize on market opportunities and deliver value to its clients.

Stable Capital and Liquidity Position

BNY Mellon maintained a strong capital and liquidity position, with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.1% and a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. The company returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders, achieving a total payout ratio of 92% year to date, reflecting its commitment to shareholder returns.

Investment Management Challenges

The investment management segment faced challenges, with fees down 1% year over year and a pretax margin of 19%, down 1% year over year. The segment also experienced $17 billion of net outflows, indicating areas for potential improvement.

Moderation in Deposit Growth

While average deposit balances grew by 6% sequentially, a moderation in deposit growth is expected in the third quarter due to seasonal slowdown and strong prior year comparisons. This anticipated moderation reflects broader market dynamics.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Looking ahead, BNY Mellon remains optimistic about its growth prospects. The company plans to continue its focus on innovation and client engagement, with expectations of sustained financial performance. Key metrics such as earnings per share, total revenue, and fee revenue are projected to maintain their upward trajectory. Additionally, the bank announced a 13% increase in its quarterly dividend and plans for continued share repurchases, signaling confidence in its future growth potential.

In conclusion, the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s earnings call highlighted a strong financial performance, with significant growth in revenue and positive operating leverage. Despite challenges in the investment management segment and expected moderation in deposit growth, the company’s focus on innovation and client engagement positions it well for future success. Investors can remain optimistic about BNY Mellon’s resilience and growth potential amidst evolving market conditions.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1916105029.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 23:04:17.922765

Albertsons Companies, Inc. recently held its earnings call, revealing a mixed sentiment among investors and analysts. The company showcased a strong emphasis on digital growth and strategic investments, which are driving positive momentum in key areas. However, challenges such as a decline in gross margin, lower earnings per share (EPS), and ongoing labor negotiations present significant hurdles. The overall outlook remains balanced between the positive strides in digital and strategic growth against financial and operational challenges.

Digital Platform Growth

Albertsons reported impressive growth in its digital platform, with e-commerce sales increasing by 25%, now accounting for 9% of total grocery revenue. The company’s loyalty program also saw a 14% increase, reaching 47 million members. Additionally, the pharmacy and health platform experienced a 20% year-over-year growth, highlighting the company’s successful digital transformation efforts.

Strategic Investments and Initiatives

The company is making strategic investments in customer value propositions, digital growth, media collective, and health and pharmacy sectors. These initiatives are expected to drive future growth, with a plan to deliver $1.5 billion in savings through their productivity engine from 2025 to 2027. These investments are aimed at enhancing the company’s competitive edge and long-term profitability.

Capital Allocation and Shareholder Returns

Albertsons has been proactive in capital allocation, investing $585 million in capital expenditures and returning $401 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This demonstrates the company’s commitment to rewarding its shareholders while continuing to invest in growth opportunities.

Positive Financial Performance

The company reported identical sales growth of 2.8%, driven by a 20% increase in pharmacy sales and a 25% rise in digital sales. This positive financial performance underscores the effectiveness of Albertsons’ strategic initiatives and its ability to adapt to changing market dynamics.

Gross Margin Decline

Despite positive sales growth, Albertsons experienced a decline in its gross margin rate by 85 basis points compared to the previous year. This was attributed to investments in customer value propositions and a mix shift impact from strong growth in the pharmacy and digital businesses.

Adjusted EPS Decline

The company’s adjusted EPS was reported at $0.55 per diluted share, down from $0.66 per diluted share last year. This decline reflects the financial challenges Albertsons faces amid its strategic investments and market shifts.

Challenges in Labor Negotiations

Albertsons is currently engaged in labor negotiations covering approximately 120,000 associates, with agreements reached for only half. This poses potential operational challenges that could impact the company’s performance if not resolved promptly.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Looking ahead, Albertsons provided guidance for fiscal 2025, with identical sales growth expected to be between 2% and 2.75%. The company plans to address profitability challenges through a productivity agenda aimed at delivering $1.5 billion in savings from 2025 to 2027. Capital expenditures are projected to range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, focusing on digital and technological modernization. Albertsons maintains its adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion for fiscal 2025 and anticipates adjusted EPS to be between $2.30 and $2.16.

In summary, Albertsons Companies, Inc.’s earnings call highlighted a mixed sentiment, with positive digital growth and strategic investments juxtaposed against financial and operational challenges. While the company is making strides in digital transformation and strategic initiatives, it must navigate profitability pressures and labor negotiations to sustain its growth trajectory.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Consumer-Defensive-1-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 21:00:32.399701

The world's largest bank by market cap reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.96 on revenue that fell 11% year-over-year to $44.9 billion, though both figures exceeded analysts' estimates. Net interest income, a key measure of profitability, rose 2% year-over-year to $23.3 billion, just short of analysts' projections.

CFO Jeremy Barnum said in Tuesday's earnings call that ""we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness"" among the bank's American customers, adding that ""the consumer basically seems to be fine.""

The bank also lifted its full-year net interest income projection by $1 billion from its previous forecast to about $95.5 billion.

""The U.S. economy remained resilient in the quarter,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a release. ""The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook, however, significant risks persist—including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices.""

JPMorgan shares edged about 0.6% lower shortly after markets opened. They're up about 20% since the start of this year.

Last quarter, JPMorgan topped estimates as Dimon warned that tariffs and trade wars were creating ""considerable turbulence"" that could persist through much of this year. JPMorgan and other banks including Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are kicking off the second-quarter earnings season, with other banks and large companies set to follow later this week.

Big bank stocks were boosted last month following the results of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test that evaluates how the institutions would fare in a severe economic downturn or recession. This year's test showed that large banks have large enough capital stored away to weather a hypothetical downturn without government assistance, the Fed said last month.

The updated mandate, which expands the current three-day policy, will apply Monday through Thursday. It is part of CEO Brian Niccol’s strategy to steer the company through falling sales and operational changes.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,” Niccol wrote in a blog post. “But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

Some managers will also be required to relocate to either Seattle, where the company is based, or Toronto. Although Niccol’s own contract did not initially demand a move to Seattle, he has since purchased a home there.

The in-office push follows other efforts under Niccol’s leadership, including updating menus, redesigning stores, and reversing a prior policy that allowed non-customers to use restrooms and linger in cafes. The company also cut 1,100 jobs earlier this year.

Starbucks joins a growing list of firms like Amazon and JP Morgan rolling back pandemic-era remote work flexibility. Research from Stanford University and others shows that while about 20% of U.S. workers remain fully remote, nearly one-third have returned full-time and 45% operate under hybrid arrangements.

Omnicom reported a 3% increase in organic revenue for the second quarter with total revenue for the period totaling just over $4 billion, up 4.2%. It maintained full-year guidance of achieving organic growth of between 2.5% and 4.5%.

But as Madison & Wall’s Brian Wieser noted after the company issued its results, Omnicom’s organic revenue figure is not a net figure and does not exclude pass-through costs such as those related to principal-based trading, which competitors like Publicis and WPP provide. Wieser estimated that Omnicom’s net organic revenue for the period was flat versus a year ago.

The company is the first to report Q2 results among the major advertising holding groups, although WPP issued an early “profit warning” last week disclosing that its Q2 results will be significantly below what it had previously indicated. The firm will issue its full Q2 report on August 7. Publicis Groupe will issue its results on Thursday.

Omnicom reported that its Media & Advertising division was up 8.2% and Precision Marketing was up 5%, together representing 68% of total revenue. Within the Media & Advertising unit, media was the best performer while the group’s creative ad agencies were roughly flat.

The company recorded nearly $89 million in “repositioning costs” for the first half of the year, primarily related to severance payments. The firm also spent $66 million on costs related to its proposed acquisition of Interpublic, which CEO John Wren told analysts on an earnings call is still on track to close later this year. He noted that 13 of the 18 countries and regions requiring approval of the transaction have given it, including the Federal Trade Commision in June.

CFO Phil Angelastro stated that the European Union has not yet given its blessing to the merger but declined to identify the other markets where approval is required. The UK has indicated that it could give approval on Aug. 13 or proceed to “phase two” of its ongoing investigation.

Asked about tariff impact on the business generally, Wren said that it was too early to tell but that for now he sees it as a “bump in the road,” that the company and its clients will surmount.

Wren said the company had not noticed a dramatic falloff in the pipeline of new business opportunities, which contrasted with WPP comments last week that it had seen new business opportunities fall by about two-thirds compared to the previous year.

“Overall, Omnicom’s numbers will likely be broadly reflective of the relative strength of the broader industry,” Wieser said. “By contrast, the weak numbers from WPP reported last week and likely soft results from IPG yet to come representing negative outliers.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/07/15/omnicom_yoccsqp_4LQzTmH.png,N,,2025-07-15 20:08:55.597748

But its new CEO, Susan Morris, painted a rosy picture of the Boise-based company’s future during a quarterly earnings call with investors on Tuesday.

In her first earnings call since taking over the top position from Vivek Sankaran in May, Morris said the supermarket chain delivered “solid operating and financial performance” while investing in operations and improving customer value.

She acknowledged inflationary pressures, saying the company is starting to see increases in the cost of goods. Morris added that Albertsons is prepared to look for alternate suppliers if tariffs “become unwieldy.”

In late March, just before President Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs, the grocer sent a letter telling suppliers to eat the cost of any related price increases. It told suppliers that if they wanted to raise prices, they would have to get permission first.

“We’ve got a very rigorous process of, first and foremost, quite frankly, just pushing back,” Morris said Tuesday in response to a question from an investor. “We’ve worked hard, and it showed in our price position as well that we’ve not passed through all of the inflation that we’re seeing from a cost of goods perspective. In certain cases, if we have to, we’ll pass them on to customers.”

Company looks to cut labor costs

Sharon McCollam, the president and chief financial officer of Albertsons, said during the call that one of the biggest areas of productivity gains that the company expects to see this year relates to outsourcing work overseas where labor is cheaper.

McCollam touted the company’s new headquarters for technology in India and said Albertsons is also transitioning many of its back-end accounting functions to an existing location that she did not specify.

The company told The Times of India that it plans to hire as many as 1,000 people in the next 18 months to work at the digital hub in Bengaluru. The move follows domestic layoffs that began in January, with hundreds of employees at sites in Idaho, California and Arizona losing their jobs, BoiseDev reported.

“We are making several — we call it internally, ways of working — moves that are helping to offset some of the pressure that we’re seeing in wages,” McCollam said. “I don’t want to specifically say union wages. It’s wages in general.”

Union negotiations progress

Morris mentioned on the call that the company has reached an agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers union representing Albertsons workers in Southern California and Colorado. She said the contracts would meaningfully improve wages and benefits.

In June, hundreds of workers at Albertsons stores in the Boise and Nampa area voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike, saying that the company committed multiple unfair labor practices, including threatening to fire an employee involved in bargaining. Albertsons denied the allegations.

The grocery giant has 5,000-5,999 employees at stores, its Boise headquarters and other sites. The company was founded by Joe Albertson in 1939 with a single store at 16th and State streets in Boise.

Morris said on Tuesday that she’s “very excited” about the company’s future.

“Our customers-for-life strategy is working,” she said in her closing remarks. “With just over two months as CEO of Albertsons company, let me say that I am more confident in our strategy with each day.”

Earnings release shows sales growth

Albertsons reported an increase of 2.8% in identical sales, 25% in digital sales, 20% growth in pharmacy and 14% in loyalty program membership for its latest quarter that ended June 14. The surge in identical sales was primarily driven by the growth in pharmacy sales, according to the company.

Morris said the company’s e-commerce business is near break-even and improving.

“Our technology-first focus is positioning us to make a greater impact faster, allowing us to drive greater innovation at a lower cost,” she said. “Driving transformational productivity is our next priority, which is an imperative to fuel our growth.”

This means he is officially bringing media under his remit to take on a local boss role, similarly to Publicis Groupe and Dentsu’s structures under Michael Rebelo and Patricio De Matteis, respectively.

It is also similar to what Omnicom is currently tipped to do, with wide industry speculation that a local management team of a combined Omnicom-IPG advertising giant will be led by Nick Garrett.

Havas Media is still recruiting for Hyland’s direct replacement, with other “future leadership announcements in due course”, according to a media release.

Since taking the helm at Havas Media within a number of months of the acquisition, Hyland has played a pivotal role in shaping the agency team and future-proofing it. Under her leadership, it has welcomed several new clients and retained clients including Red Bull, Perfetti, Uniting, Tourism Fiji, and Retail Food Group. It is shortlisted for next week’s Mumbrella Awards, for Media Agency of the Year.

She also led the launch of Havas Play and CSA (data, tech, and analytics).

“I want to thank Havas for welcoming Hyland Media and our clients into the fold. It’s been a privilege to work alongside so many creative, driven, and talented people across the local and global network. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together,” Hyland said in the release.

“To my teammates — thank you for believing in our shared vision as a challenger agency to ‘Dare to be Different’. To our valued clients — I wish you continued success as you navigate the exciting future of data, tech, and AI. It has been my personal pleasure to be part of your journey, some for as long as 25 years.”

Wright thanked Hyland, wishing her “every success in the future”.

“Going forward we are strongly committed to driving our pioneering integration as a group with many bold ambitions to maximise our talents, technology and data smarts that supercharge our teams and clients’ brands,” he said.

“To support this we have a number of significant investments and moves planned to help us play and win differently as the challenger holdco in market.”",https://mumbrella.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/James-Wright-2025-headshot-scaled-e1752620101221.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 20:09:00.310446

Overall revenue increased to $24.88 billion from $24.27 billion in the year-prior quarter, driven by a 2.8% increase in identical sales. Digital sales gained 25% in the period year over year, Albertsons noted. Operating income slipped to $449.3 million from $459.6 million in the year-earlier quarter.

Albertsons updated its identical sales growth outlook for the current fiscal year to a range of 2% to 2.75% versus the previous 1.5% to 2.5%.

Digital Assets and Platform Innovation Establish New Competitive Advantage

During Q2 2025, BNY Mellon secured high-profile stablecoin custody mandates with Societe Generale (announced in June 2025) and Ripple (announced in July 2025), demonstrating expanding traction in digital finance infrastructure.

The bank continues to leverage its early investments in digital assets, offering a range of services from issuance to custodianship, and operates bitcoin custody services natively, reaching 100 markets globally through its buy-side trading solutions.

""Last month, Societe Generale selected BNY to act as reserve custodian for their first USD stablecoin in Europe. And last week, Ripple announced that BNY will act as primary custodian of Ripple's US stablecoin reserves. Today, BNY is a leader in servicing the growing stablecoin market, enabling companies to create and use stablecoins by providing wide-ranging services from issuance to ongoing operations.""

— Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer

BNY is providing long-term resilience and expanding its addressable market among institutional clients seeking regulated solutions.

Disciplined Capital Management Preserves Flexibility Amid Strong Returns

BNY ended the quarter with an 11.5% CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1) ratio, unchanged sequentially, and returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, achieving a 92% total payout ratio year-to-date, underscoring consistent capital discipline. The Federal Reserve's 2025 stress tests confirmed BK's stress capital buffer remains at the 2.5% regulatory floor, and the board declared a 13% dividend increase following the results.

""With regards to our second quarter results, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1%, down 17 basis points sequentially. Tier 1 capital increased by $689 million, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends. Average assets increased primarily driven by deposit growth. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Over the course of the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to our common shareholders, resulting in a 92% total payout ratio year to date.""

— Dermot McDonogh, Chief Financial Officer

Operating Model Transformation Drives Enduring Efficiency and Organic Growth

Fifty percent of BNY's workforce now operates within its new platform operating model; this reorganization has already contributed to 500 basis points of positive operating leverage in Q2 2025. In parallel, widespread adoption of the Eliza AI platform among employees and initial deployment of digital employees are cited as foundational for future efficiency gains and new solution development for clients.

""With more than half of our people at BNY working in the model today, we remain on track to complete our phased transition into the platform's operating model by this time next year. Already, we are starting to see the impact of this new way of working, enabling our people to launch more new solutions, deploy more code releases, and come together better than ever before to support our clients.""

— Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer

The platform operating model and AI adoption are lowering the annual expense growth trajectory—guided at approximately 3% for full-year 2025 (excluding notable items)—while embedding scalable innovation capacity, which management expects will benefit future growth.

Looking Ahead

Management raised its forecast for full-year 2025 net interest income to high single-digit percentage growth and reaffirmed expectations for solid fee revenue growth, with expenses (excluding notable items) guided to rise approximately 3%. The effective tax rate is projected at 22% to 23% for the full year.

BNY Mellon plans to return roughly 100% of 2025 earnings via dividends and buybacks.

A Louisville, Kentucky-based investor reached a deal to buy the majority stake in a newly opened casino in Southern New Hampshire.

Churchill Downs Inc., owner of the famous race track that hosts the Kentucky Derby, entered into an agreement to acquire 90% ownership in the Live Casino in Salem, the company announced Monday. A securities filing shows it paid $180M for the stake.

CDI purchased a 51% stake from The Cordish Cos., operator of the nationwide Live Casino brand. And it bought a 39% stake from F&L Gaming, an entity owned by local developers Sal Lupoli and Joe Faro.

Lupoli and Faro will maintain a 10% ownership of the casino.

The deal comes after the casino opened its doors last week in a former department store space at The Mall at Rockingham Park, roughly 30 miles north of Boston.

The first phase of the casino includes 100 horse racing machines and 13 live table games. CDI plans to move forward with construction on future phases of the project, which include expansion and rebranding.

CDI previously operated the casino's Chasers Poker Room and will continue to do so under the new ownership agreement.

“New Hampshire is an exciting opportunity, and this transaction – and our new partnership with Joe Faro and Sal Lupoli – allows us to develop a regional destination to draw patrons to Salem from across the growing New England market,” CDI CEO Bill Carstanjen said in a statement.

Simon Property Group owns the mall and signed off on the development as a way to fill the 159K SF that was left behind by Lord & Taylor in 2021. Live Casino signed a 20-year lease, bumping occupancy to 86%.

Before the lease, Simon was facing potential issues as a 2026 maturity approaches on its $262M loan. The mall owner obtained the loan from Barclays Bank and Société Générale for a 541K SF portion of the 1M SF mall.

Joe Faro and developer Sal Lupoli developed the casino at an estimated cost of $160M. The duo partnered with Maryland-based The Cordish Cos., which owns several casinos in cities such as Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri.

Next to the mall, Faro owns the 3.8M SF Tuscan Village project, which spans over 170 acres at the former Rockingham Park Race Track. Lupoli is the founder of Lupoli Cos. — one of the region's largest commercial development firms — as well as Sal's Pizza.",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=png&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2025%2F02%2F67a65e68e87f4-screen-shot-2025-02-07-at-2-26-09-pm.png&width=1200&sign=3qrcbHuJoedrGktPRLCOzXGI4rx6EUxcQOTJdnjuYMA,N,,2025-07-15 19:10:06.552827

This project brings together senior executives from leading cryptocurrency companies, including Ripple, Coinbase, and MoonPay, along with technology giants like Instacart, Snapchat, and Anduril Technologies, as well as prominent angel investor Ron Conway.

The first meeting of the project's working group was held at Ripple's San Francisco headquarters on June 6. The primary goals of the Breakthrough Project are to encourage collaboration between state-level decision-makers and experts from the technology, business, and innovation sectors. Additionally, the project aims to identify and address systematic inefficiencies in government processes, services, and technology, while providing innovative solutions. It also seeks to create new competition and project models based in California to develop modern solutions, all while maintaining public transparency, worker and civil society participation, and ethical safeguards throughout the innovation process.

Rumors are circulating about a potential collaboration between Ripple, the company behind the cryptocurrency XRP, and the California government. This development is part of Governor Newsom's broader strategy to enhance California's efficiency by connecting state agencies with tech executives to identify new opportunities for innovation and improvement. The collaboration is part of the California Breakthrough Project, which aims to foster collaboration between California regulators and tech leaders.

The task force includes executives from Ripple, Coinbase, MoonPay, and other prominent tech companies. These executives are advising and advancing government initiatives to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, Ripple's CTO, David Schwartz, has confirmed that Ripple is no longer focused on partnerships with traditional banks, citing their slow pace as a hindrance to innovation. This shift in focus suggests that Ripple is more interested in collaborating with forward-thinking entities like the California government, which is eager to leverage technology to improve its operations.

Governor Newsom is set to unveil a ""government efficiency"" strategy that includes a new executive order and a fresh crew of tech leaders. This strategy is designed to leverage technology to improve government operations and services. The potential collaboration between Ripple and California could have significant implications for the state's economy, which is the largest in the United States. By integrating blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions, California aims to streamline government processes and enhance transparency.

The involvement of tech leaders from various companies suggests a concerted effort to drive innovation and improve government operations. The California Breakthrough Project is a significant step towards integrating technology into government operations. By leveraging the expertise of tech leaders, California aims to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness. The collaboration between Ripple and California could set a precedent for other states and governments looking to integrate blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions into their operations. The potential benefits of this collaboration include improved transparency, enhanced security, and streamlined processes, all of which could have a positive impact on California's economy and government operations.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 19:09:13.739096

Health insurer Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV) is scheduled to release its second quarter 2025 financial results on July 17.

Analysts estimate adjusted earnings of $9.197 per share on sales of $48.24 billion, as per data from Benzinga Pro.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) has been the first major health insurer to report quarterly earnings for several quarters. However, this quarter, the insurance giant will release its second quarter 2025 financial results on July 29.

As it’s the biggest player in the industry, Forbes writes that analysts and investors often use its results to gauge the sector’s overall health.

All eyes will be on the sector after Centene Corp’s (NYSE:CNC) withdrawal of its 2025 GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which stems from its initial review of 2025 industry data from Wakely, an independent actuarial firm.

While withdrawing its comprehensive EPS guidance, Centene has reaffirmed its fiscal year 2025 adjusted EPS to be greater than $7.25, aligning with the consensus of $7.23.

UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 outlook in May, citing that care activity continued to accelerate.

Earlier in July, managed healthcare service provider under the Medicaid and Medicare programs, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH), issued preliminary second-quarter results and lowered its full-year 2025 earnings outlook, citing rising medical costs across its Medicaid, Medicare, and state marketplace businesses.

The company expects Q2 adjusted earnings of approximately $5.50 per share—slightly below earlier forecasts—due to expected cost pressures that will persist into the second half of the year.

As a result, Molina cut its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to $21.50 -$22.50, down from at least $24.50 previously. The new forecast reflects a consolidated pre-tax margin just under 4%, at the low end of the company’s long-term target.

Forbes adds Centene’s announcement is just the latest in a series of updates from health insurers who, over the past two years, have had a hard time managing the costs of people enrolled in government-subsidized health plans.

Kenvue later inked a “cooperation agreement” with Starboard that saw its CEO, Jeffrey Smith, immediately join the board.","With activist investor Starboard Value holding a seat on Kenvue’s board of directors, the consumer healthcare company is taking big steps in its strategic review that has now resulted in a leadership shakeup.

Thibaut Mongon, who has helmed Kenvue since its spinout from Johnson & Johnson in 2023, is out effective immediately, the company announced in a Monday press release.

With Mongon out, Kenvue tapped board member Kirk Perry to take the CEO spot on an interim basis as the company and its executive search firm look for a permanent replacement.

The CEO transition signals the first step in a “set of actions” meant to help Kenvue “reach its full potential,” according to the company's release.

“We are considering a broad range of potential alternatives, including ways to simplify the company’s portfolio and how it operates,” board chairman Larry Merlo said in the release. “At the same time, with the CEO transition and recent appointment of a new CFO, we are aligning leadership expertise to drive the company forward.”

Mongon, a 20-year Johnson & Johnson veteran, was the natural choice to lead Kenvue through its spinout after spending four years chairing the consumer health organization when it was still under J&J’s wing. He was initially joined by chief financial officer Paul Ruh before the company brought Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company) finance executive Amit Banati in as a CFO replacement in May.

Kenvue, which makes powerhouse consumer health brands such as Listerine mouthwash and pain reliever Tylenol, saw its second-quarter sales slip 4%, the company also reported on Monday.

The J&J spinout will disclose its full quarterly outcomes and a revised 2025 sales outlook in August. Previously, the company expected its full-year results to bring a net sales change of -1% to +1% compared to last year.

Kenvue’s sliding sales and new mission to “ensure we have the right talent, brand portfolio and operational foundation,” as Merlo put it, echoes activist investor Starboard’s previous sentiments about the company.

In a February proxy statement, Starboard outlined a goal to unlock the company's “trapped potential."" The investor pointed to “disappointing” financial results and “ineffective board oversight” hindering the company’s performance.

Its headquarters reportedly houses about 7,100 Target employees.
For Starbucks employees, those who don't want to pack up and move will have the option of a voluntary exit that will come with a one-time cash payment.
Target employees had earlier been given ""significant leeway"" in terms of how often they could commute to the company's physical office spaces, Harper-Tibaldo said.
Starbucks' looming four-day mandate lands at a point when the company is scrambling to rebound from a yearslong sales slump.","The days of pandemic-era workplace flexibility appear to be waning as another round of some of the country's largest employers step up their in-office requirements.

Coffee chain Starbucks and retailer Target are preparing to escalate their attendance policies in moves that coincide with broader efforts to turn around sales and shed privileges adopted in the earlier years of the global health crisis.

A growing cohort of companies across the United States is demanding more in-person time from employees, either by revoking remote work privileges, increasing the number of days they're required to commute to an office or asking a portion of the workforce to relocate closer to a corporate hub.

For Target, that means putting an end to what has been nearly half a decade of its flexible work policy. It is now asking employees across its merchandising division to return to its headquarters in downtown Minneapolis at least three days a week. Its headquarters reportedly houses about 7,100 Target employees.

In Seattle, Starbucks told its corporate employees that its current three-day office requirement would be bumped up to a minimum of four days, starting at the beginning of the company's fiscal year in October. Alongside the boosted attendance mandate, the coffee giant has also told workers within its support center division — many of whom have been working remotely — that they will have to relocate either to Seattle or Toronto within the next year.

Amid backlash from their workers, some companies are justifying the mandates by saying the in-office time is more valuable and productive than work done outside of it.

""Team members tell us they see the benefit from the in-person connection and collaboration that's a part of being in the office,"" Brian Harper-Tibaldo, Target's director of media relations, said in a statement. ""At this point, individual leaders are empowered to make decisions for their teams based on company guidance as well as what's best for the role they play in our business.""

Across the United States, the debate over flexible work policies has settled somewhat since early in the pandemic. Still, it remains a sticking point between employers and their workers.

""We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,"" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol told employees this week. ""But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.""

For Starbucks employees, those who don't want to pack up and move will have the option of a voluntary exit that will come with a one-time cash payment.

Niccol was hired last year to lead the company and initially wasn't required to relocate. The former Chipotle CEO, who had been able to commute from Southern California via corporate jet, now has a home and office in Seattle, a Starbucks spokesperson confirmed.

Target employees had earlier been given ""significant leeway"" in terms of how often they could commute to the company's physical office spaces, Harper-Tibaldo said.

Hybrid work mandates have largely been attributed to contributing to the national office vacancy rate rising to a record high of about 14%, according to CoStar data.

Starbucks' looming four-day mandate lands at a point when the company is scrambling to rebound from a yearslong sales slump. It laid off about 1,100 corporate employees earlier this year, and executives have said face-to-face time in the office is crucial to getting the company back on track.

Corporate leaders at chipmaker Intel, the national arm of Japanese automaker Nissan, and other major companies have linked greater attendance with better performance.

""At the end of the day, I need to re-create a culture and a fighting spirit, break silos and bring [people] together,"" Nissan Americas Chairman Christian Meunier said earlier this year. ""With people working from home, we've lost the teamwork that existed, that nimbleness, and that underdog fighting spirit that we used to have. Let's get in a room and fix the problem together.""

Other large employers such as Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Caterpillar, AT&T, Southwest Airlines and Walmart have recently stepped up their in-person requirements, and a number of employers are now demanding workers commute to an office all five days of the workweek.

Escalated mandates have fueled optimism among national office landlords, who are looking to retain their portfolio occupancy as tenants slashed real estate to both trim costs and adjust to flexible post-pandemic work policies.

Some of the country's largest landlords have said that stricter in-office mandates are enough to bolster growing optimism that the demand for space will climb as corporate heavyweights push to revert to their pre-pandemic workweek schedules. The number of CEOs who expected their companies to adopt a full return to a five-day workweek climbed from the 64% reported last year to about 85%, according to a recent KPMG survey.

Target has experienced a sales slump of its own over the past several years, a trajectory the company is now trying to turn around with its own heightened attendance mandate.

""More time together, in the office, will help us grow our business faster, solve problems quickly, and build stronger relationships,"" Target's Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez wrote in a company memo notifying employees of the change.",https://costar.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53bc2dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1729+0+0/resize/2100x1729!/quality/100/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcostar-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F4d%2F90%2F58f7b5bd410eaf47d51a9b7de5da%2Ftarget-hq.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 20:09:19.446088

Starbucks will let rewards members order four new customized drinks on its app, legitimizing some of its secret menu items, the brand said Monday.

The new drinks will be available in the “offers” tab of the app, which will routinely feature new drink customizations.

By making common customizations — popularized on social media as a secret menu — more accessible, Starbucks may drive fresh consumer traffic. However, the move seems to stand in contrast with efforts to simplify its menu and return the chain to its coffeehouse roots.

Since Brian Niccol became CEO at Starbucks last year, the brand has pivoted toward a coffee-forward marketing strategy, greater emphasis on on-premise experience and technology changes meant to ease the pressure of mobile ordering.

The brand also said it was adding guardrails on customization and standardizing pricing for many of its drink changes.

The addition of new, complex drink customizations available only through digital channels could complicate these efforts by putting pressure on barista workflows, encouraging consumers to order off-premise, non-coffee drinks and pushing shoppers to experiment with new configurations.

Starbucks is holding a contest allowing consumers and workers to design more custom drinks. Entries will be narrowed down to four finalists which will be subject to a vote running from Aug. 18 to 20. The finalists will receive a $5,000 prize and the drinks will run on the secret menu from Aug. 18 to 25. The winner will receive an additional $25,000 prize.

Albertsons is investing in its digital customer experience and loyalty program as it approaches the breakeven point for its e-commerce business, executives said on a Q1 2025 earnings call Tuesday.

To enhance its digital shopping, the company introduced a shop assist feature, which lets customers and store associates communicate during the order fulfillment process, according to CEO Susan Morris, who took on the role in May.

The Albertsons for U loyalty program grew membership 14% year over year to 47 million members in the first quarter, according to Morris. She attributed the growth to last year’s initiative to make the program easier to understand.

Dive Insight:

While the grocer’s sales and loyalty growth have been stable, Albertsons is still charting an uncertain future following the breakup of its merger with Kroger, and cost-cutting measures led to layoffs this year.

The grocer’s loyalty program will play an important role in the grocer’s future, Morris told The Wall Street Journal in an interview last month. Albertsons will take better advantage of loyalty member data to determine which items can withstand higher prices and which need a price drop to bring in more customers.

Albertsons for U could support this goal with rapid growth. Membership has steadily increased in recent quarters, up from 41.4 million in Q1 2024.

Albertsons executives highlighted e-commerce as one of the company’s biggest growth, customer acquisition and customer retention opportunities, though the channel has yet to achieve profitability.

“Our focus on delivering exceptional customer service experience is fueling new customer acquisition and strengthening existing customer retention,” Morris said. “To do this, we're continuing to enhance our digital shopping experience, including the introduction of AI and interactive features that deliver both ease and convenience.”

One way the grocer aims to improve flexibility is by letting customers add items to an online order right until picking starts. The change was made because “shoppers often think of one more item they need just after an order is placed,” Morris said.

E-commerce sales were up 25% year over year in the first quarter, but penetration remains below grocery industry peers, according to Morris. Digital sales accounted for 9% of Albertsons’ total grocery revenue in the quarter.

Albertsons is bringing its mobile app into the store as well, according to Morris. Digital customers use it three times per week on average for capabilities including personalized meal planning and in-store product location tools.

“What began as a tool for enabling e-commerce and delivering great deals is now a Swiss Army knife of tools that makes customers’ lives easier regardless of whether they're shopping in our stores or online,” Morris said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/oOz7OwQQ7e5i7KB9qmaZIFi2PM1BSSD6KV1AVtcZmNU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BbGJlcnRzb25zX1Nhbk1hcmNvc18wMV9oZXJvLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-15 18:08:00.588342

Shoppers shifted to so-called store brands as they became better bargains, the bank said, noting that such products now cost an average of $2 less than alternatives.

The rapid use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in 2025 has profoundly affected the semiconductor sector, resulting in unprecedented growth for advanced chip technologies. According to estimates made by the Capgemini Research Institute, this advancement will increase semiconductor demand by 29 percent by the close of 2026.

Generative AI, which allows machines to generate text, images, and music, requires vast computing power. As of 2025, industries have started utilizing these technologies in their everyday operations and are thus able to plugin ultra-sophisticated semiconductors capable of managing complex AI multi-tasking. The majors like Nvidia and Broadcom can see these trends.

For example, Broadcom greatly exceeded Wall Street's expectations in 2025 with Q1 revenue of USD 14.9 billion. This is believed to be due to the significant custom AI chip investments made by the grab tech companies Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. These companies, referred to as Hyper-scale, are now concentrating on next-generation AI models, significantly increasing the need for advanced semiconductors.

Likewise, AI-powered GPU chips are becoming essential, and Nvidia's financial results from 2025 testify to that. Revenue for the company increased from the previous year by 78 percent, totaling USD 39.33 billion. This was made possible by the integration of AI technologies into different industries. Nvidia's development of the Blackwell series of AI chips is crucial to its growth and the semiconductor industry's growth.

However, this growth has its challenges. The Capgemini report said that more than half of businesses that depend on chips are worried about semiconductor supply in the next two years. In 2025, automotive, consumer electronics, and telecommunications will likely face these shortages, which set back progress for new technologies and hurt the economy.

These issues are driving companies to try to find new solutions for the problem of securing semiconductor supplies. Some of these approaches involve changing clients, sponsoring proactive chip production, or becoming clients to the manufacturers of semiconductor fabs with the additional condition that the minimum order will meet the ever-increasing demand because of AI. Apart from that, there is a growing trend to boost investments given the geopolitical situation because there is a clear understanding that dependence on foreigners is a significant danger.

The relationship between generative AI and the demand for semiconductors in the year 2025 highlights a vital period in the development of the technology industry. The world of AI is changing as it begins to merge with other fields, meaning that growth is expected in the semiconductor market. Still, supply chain bottlenecks have to be dealt with before opportunities available in this AI-led age can be utilized to the fullest.",https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/uploads/new_news_image/Global_semiconductor_market_growth_till_2030.png,N,,2025-07-15 19:08:48.841732

Seven in ten advertisers and agencies using retail media have increased their investment in the last twelve months, according to the IAB Australia Retail Media State of the Nation 2025 Report.

The report, now in its third year, draws from data gathered in an industry survey conducted in June 2025 across 161 senior advertising decision makers across retailers, media agencies, agency trading desks, creative agencies and advertiser brands.

Of the buy side respondents, 66% were from advertising agencies and 34% from brands. Information was also collected from 19 retailers with a retail media offering in place.

The findings cement retail media advertising as an integral part of holistic media planning.

According to the report, 77% of advertisers and agencies work with three or more retail media networks, up from 58% last year.

However, as the sector scales, brands and agencies are seeking more transparency and consistency, along with better data access, consistent metrics and unified measurement frameworks across retail networks.

The Report found that investment in retail media activity now comes from a mix of fully reallocated budgets (35%) and new budgets (19%).

Brands reported increasingly shifting their spend away from trade marketing and traditional media advertising, while agencies were reallocating budget from social media and digital display budgets.

Advertisers continue to express frustrations with lack of clear, standardised performance metrics across networks. ROAS was identified as the most important metric sought by 78% of agencies and brands, while incremental sales measurement was the second at 71%.

The leading barriers to investment in retail media were found to be demonstrating ROI (38% of brand advertisers) and measurement and reporting limitations (30% of agencies).

“Retail media is gaining momentum, but we’re now at a pivotal stage where structure and collaboration are essential,” Gai Le Roy, CEO of IAB Australia, said.

“To fully unlock the potential of this channel, the industry needs shared frameworks, clear measurement principles and greater transparency across networks.

“As we’ve seen in other maturing digital channels, establishing consistency is what allows innovation to scale. That’s where the IAB and its members can play a critical role.”

Lachlan Brahe, Chair of the IAB Australia Retail Media Council and Commercial Director at Epsilon, said: “Moving into its third year, this report demonstrates growth and enthusiasm for retail media whilst reminding us where we, collectively, need to lift our game.

“With Retail Media becoming a staple for brands, there remain challenges for advertisers to navigate and adapt to fragmented systems and metrics.

“Further education is essential to support advertisers in understanding how best to leverage new formats and channels to achieve objectives and to compare performance across networks.”

IAB Australia Retail Media State of the Nation report’s additional findings:

• Retail media is no longer confined to major supermarkets and marketplaces, with financial services and tech companies, as well as loyalty platforms entering the space.

• Retailers are diversifying their media offerings and formats, with 85% seeking to enhance their measurement offering over the next twelve months, and 77% looking to expand the ad products and channels offered.

• The predominant objective for retail media activities is increasing sales according to 83% of agencies and advertisers, while 76% cite increasing purchase intent or action. By contrast retailers reported they believe influencing customers across the entire purchase funnel is the top opportunity.

• Agency planning and strategy teams are restructuring to integrate retail media, while retailers are hiring additional resources.

• On-site search or sponsored products are the most used retail media advertising products, increasing 21 points this year, with on-site display and in-store digital signage also highly used. Off-site extensions powered by retailer data has increased by 19 points.

The closure is part of Rite Aid’s ongoing effort to reduce debt and cut operational losses by shutting down underperforming locations. The Los Banos store was among the locations in California selected for liquidation as the chain works through its court-approved reorganization plan.

Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time on May 5, 2025, citing mounting liabilities and declining revenue across its national footprint. Hundreds of stores across the country have since been closed or sold to competitors.

The Los Banos location, situated along a busy commercial corridor near other major retailers, had long served as one of the city’s two primary chain pharmacies. Following the closure, customer prescriptions were transferred to nearby branches, according to Rite Aid’s official pharmacy locator.

The closure leaves Los Banos residents with fewer big-brand pharmacy options, though services remain available through Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy inside the Target store on West Pacheco Boulevard, and several locally operated independent drugstores.

As of mid-July, city officials have not announced any new tenant for the now-vacant Rite Aid building. The site’s future remains uncertain as the community adjusts to the loss of a longtime local pharmacy.

""While Meta is betting on bespoke AI superclusters, Google is taking a more balanced route,"" he said.
Meta's AI gamble Sanyal said Meta's strategy might be to horde AI infrastructure and talent.","Google's power play

The propulsion of AI computing requires a massive amount of power, and big tech companies are competing to shore up energy pipelines.

On Tuesday, Google said it would invest $25 billion in data centers and AI infrastructure within the nation's largest U.S. electric grid -- which covers 13 states -- over the next two years.

Google also said it would spend $3 billion to update two hydropower plants in Pennsylvania to help power the energy-hungry data centers. The Pennsylvania investment is part of an agreement with Brookfield Asset Management to buy 3,000 megawatts of carbon-free hydroelectric power in the U.S.

Google's parent company, Alphabet, earlier this year said it would spend $75 billion in 2025 on data centers and infrastructure. In June, the company said it would partner with CTC Global Corp. to use new technology to free up grid capacity across the country.

Sanyal said there's a stark contrast between the AI strategies from Meta and Google.

""While Meta is betting on bespoke AI superclusters, Google is taking a more balanced route,"" he said. ""They are pairing aggressive data center expansion with long-term clean energy procurement. Their $3 billion hydro deal secures up to 3 gigawatts renewable power, giving them not just capacity but predictability.""

While Meta is going in on scale-first buildouts, Google is threading compute, sustainability and grid alignment, he said, adding that ""both are aiming for leadership.""

Meta's AI gamble

Sanyal said Meta's strategy might be to horde AI infrastructure and talent. The company has already poached top talent from competitors, including OpenAI and Apple, offering lucrative signing bonuses. Meta hired former Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross after a failed attempt to buy the company, according to published reports.

""Meta is trying to force its way back to the center of the AI conversation using compute, capital and headcount,"" Sanyal said. ""This also comes with serious execution risk. Scaling that kind of infrastructure is hard. Talent integration at this level is even harder. And alignment, safety and public trust will only get trickier the more power you throw at the system.""

Whether Meta executes on its strategy is still to be determined, but the outcome could be critical either way.

""If Meta executes, this could reset the pecking order in AI,"" he said. ""And if they don't, it could be the most expensive HR experiment in history.""

Depending on who you ask, the problem is either a failed state, a flawed business model, or both.
Long steel’s long goodbye Amsa has confirmed that unless a last-minute industrial miracle occurs, it will shutter its loss-making long steel operations at Newcastle Works, Vereeniging Works, and its rail-focused subsidiary.

In a sharply worded statement, ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa) claims Daily Maverick “misrepresents the complex reality of South Africa’s steel sector” and unfairly promotes “a misleading narrative in favour of mini-mills and scrap metal traders, particularly those who benefit from importing cheap finished steel.”

The company argues that the journalist (me) presents mini-mills as a silver bullet and “masks the vested interests of a small cohort of import-reliant firms”, adding that the idea these facilities can simply replace integrated production is “economically and technically untenable”. Cool.

Amsa’s voice is strained by its terminal injuries — it’s long steel business – slated for mothballing come the end of September 2025 – and a policy environment the company says leaves it no choice but to start winding down.

Depending on who you ask, the problem is either a failed state, a flawed business model, or both.

Long steel’s long goodbye

Amsa has confirmed that unless a last-minute industrial miracle occurs, it will shutter its loss-making long steel operations at Newcastle Works, Vereeniging Works, and its rail-focused subsidiary.

The company says it has exhausted the R1.68-billion bailout from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and “cannot assume any further financial risks related to the Long Steel Business beyond the next few months.”

The closure directly threatens 3,500 jobs. But according to Elias Monage, president of the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa), the ripple effects could be catastrophic: “The signs of collapse are unmistakable. This is not just about a single mill – it is about an entire industrial ecosystem at risk.”

Monage’s message is no longer merely a plea for urgent intervention. In a June statement, he called for a full-scale reset:

“South Africa’s steel and engineering sector stands at a perilous crossroads. Years of deindustrialisation, declining production, job losses and a steady erosion of competitiveness have brought us here. This decline is not the result of chance, but a culmination of systemic policy failures, a lack of coordinated action and inadequate implementation of recovery frameworks.”

Dance if you want to dance

Monage once championed the Steel Master Plan as a roadmap for reindustrialisation. Now he concedes the plan has “not lived up to its potential”. Instead of decisive action, he describes a “diffusion and inaction” that left industry leaders disillusioned.

“The Steel Master Plan had over 20 workstreams and 73 deliverables, but it lacked focus. Progress stalled, and as it did, industry leadership began to withdraw,” Monage says.

The hard stats back him up: steel production remains 18% below its 2007/8 peak, capacity utilisation has slipped below efficiency benchmarks, and per capita steel consumption has dropped by 37% since 2013 – all while global steel intensity rises.

Monage argues that South Africa needs a new “strategic agreement for impact,” a compact that binds government and industry to shared, measurable objectives like achieving 4-5% annual growth in metals and engineering output. “Business as usual will not suffice,” he warns.

“This moment demands a bold shift – from fragmented policies and siloed departments to a unified national compact anchored in public-private collaboration.”

Let’s play the blame game

National Employers’ Association of South Africa (Neasa) CEO Gerhard Papenfus has long argued that Amsa’s woes are self-inflicted, a product of propping up an uncompetitive giant. But Amsa doesn’t think the one-time, self-appointed envoy to Washington, DC, is arguing in good faith.

“Though Neasa does not publicly disclose its membership, multiple sources including Neasa press statements and trade forums highlight its strong representation of steel traders and re-rollers with minimal domestic productive capacity,” the company said.

Amsa also countered that narrative directly. “Mini-mills that can replace integrated primary steel production are economically and technically untenable,” the company insists. “Mini-mills based on scrap cannot produce the full range of high-quality, flat and long products required by the automotive, mining, defence, renewable energy and construction sectors.”

The core argument is that the Preferential Pricing System (PPS) and export restrictions have cost informal workers and recyclers R60-billion over a decade, while propping up a few scrap-based mills employing only 5,000 people.

Government goes to the mat

“The PPS has not just failed; it has actively undermined the viability of integrated producers,” Amsa says. Worse still, it accuses mini-mills of gaming the system: “Declining to purchase scrap at PPS-mandated discounts, only to subsequently call for tighter export controls to suppress prices further.”

The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) has admitted it is in “firefighting mode,” with Minister Parks Tau’s working group scrambling to contain the fallout.

But Monage is clear: “Government must acknowledge that past interventions, however well-intentioned, have not delivered. Without leadership, clarity and decisive action, the socioeconomic consequences – more job losses, more factory closures, deeper erosion of capacity – will only deepen.”

Meanwhile, globally…

ArcelorMittal’s global operations are booming. With Q1 2025 gross profit of $1.6-billion and strategic expansions in Liberia, India and the US, the global group is thriving while Amsa fights for its life.

The South African story remains bleak: rail failures labelled “the worst performance on record”, soaring energy costs and shrinking domestic demand. Even with a smaller loss expected this month, Amsa warns that “without immediate policy coherence”, integrated plants like Newcastle and Vanderbijlpark could become relics.

But Monage offers a final plea for collective ambition: “No country can industrialise – or reindustrialise – without a resilient metals sector. Steel is the foundational input into mining, construction, transport, manufacturing, energy and agriculture. We must rescue the original intent of the Master Plan and build a future of inclusive, job-rich growth.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2161783863-scaled.jpg?fit=1280%2C732&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-15 17:08:05.286121

Three distinct approaches, three brand visions, and one common goal—dominate the minds of fans and the global football stage.

A World Cup of Historic Proportions

The 2026 edition, hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will feature 48 teams and 104 matches, making it the most extensive tournament ever held. Expected to generate over $10 billion in revenue—including significant increases in broadcasting and marketing rights—this projection has elevated the strategic value of sponsorships, sparking fierce competition among the industry’s top brands.

Nike Expands Its Global Footprint

Nike arrives strong, outfitting high-profile national teams such as Brazil, France, England, and host country USA. The company has pursued an aggressive investment strategy: multimillion-dollar contracts like Brazil’s ($100 million annually through 2038), and a future deal with Germany starting in 2027 worth $110 million per year—double what Adidas previously paid. This move reflects a long-term strategy focused on premium assets and maximum visibility in key markets.

Adidas: Official Partner with Legacy and Strategy

Adidas holds an unmatched structural advantage as FIFA’s official sponsor and the official match ball provider since 1970, also outfitting referees, volunteers, and officials. Its solid roster includes reigning champions Argentina, co-host Mexico, as well as Spain and Italy. Although it will lose Germany after the World Cup, Adidas has signed Croatia and could become a strong contender to outfit Brazil after 2026.

Puma: The Tech-Savvy Challenger

Puma has taken bold steps, snatching Portugal from Nike and tripling its marketing investment compared to 2024. With its “Go Wild” campaign, the brand aims to captivate Gen Z through a narrative of self-expression, enjoyment, and social connection. Additionally, it has integrated artificial intelligence into kit design, clearly setting itself apart from competitors.

Technology and Design as Differentiators

Innovation represents another battleground in this rivalry.

Nike integrates its Dri-FIT ADV system into jerseys designed to optimize performance in extreme heat. Its aesthetic blends nostalgia (vintage kits like Brazil ’98) with bold urban flair (e.g., Uruguay’s “Black Panther” design).

Adidas unveils the official match ball “Trionda,” inspired by the cultures of the host countries. The brand also brings back the trefoil logo on away kits and introduces Climacool+ technology, along with a collection of historic remakes (Argentina 2006, Germany 1994).

Puma positions itself as a pioneer by allowing fans to co-design kits using AI (as seen with Manchester City). Its FUTURE 8 boots feature next-gen elastic materials aimed at boosting on-field creativity.

Marketing Strategies with Unique DNA

Nike doesn’t need to be an official partner to dominate the public imagination. It did so with the legendary “Write the Future” campaign in 2010, and now returns with “Winning Isn’t for Everyone,” a bold take on the exclusivity of success and the fusion of football with urban fashion. Its “Toma El Juego” initiative in Los Angeles reflects Nike’s ambition to conquer the streets as much as the stadiums.

Adidas focuses on the “magic of the fan.” Immersive fan zones, direct interaction with stars, and a legacy-driven narrative—from Messi to Lamine Yamal—aim to solidify emotional connections across generations. Its official status allows for integrated activations that rivals cannot replicate.

Puma is going all-in on Gen Z. Its global “Go Wild” campaign celebrates authenticity over victory. The brand leverages platforms like TikTok for viral content, invests in hyperlocal activations, and partners with global stars like Cristiano Ronaldo to expand its reach. Its goal is clear: build brand preference, not just awareness.

North America: The Main Battleground

With three host countries, North America becomes a strategic arena. Nike dominates in the U.S., backed by a historic partnership since 1994 and a strong retail presence. Adidas is betting on Mexico, a football powerhouse with millions of fans also living in the U.S. Puma, with a smaller footprint, aims to make an impact through disruptive campaigns and high-profile partnerships.

Adidas leads global football with a market share near 29%, while Nike holds the top spot in the overall sportswear market at 16%. Puma trails behind but has room to grow. The 2026 World Cup could shift that balance: the brand that best connects with emotion, cultural trends, and fan-centric technology will gain more than exposure—it will earn loyalty.

Three Paths, One Goal

Adidas enters with institutional strength, Nike with cultural clout, and Puma with youth-driven innovation. The 2026 World Cup will serve as a marketing laboratory, where styles, narratives, and technologies are put to the test. In this ball-less war—where visibility and emotional resonance mean everything—the outcome will be decided not just on the pitch, but in the hearts and minds of the spectators.",https://panamericanworld.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/marcas1-mundial-2026.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 20:08:52.231957

ID25,McDonald’s,2025-07-15 20:29:26+00:00,www.darkreading.com,Lessons Learned From McDonald's Big AI Flub - Dark Reading,Alexander Culafi,,,,,https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/lessons-learned-mcdonalds-ai-flub,"Carroll and Curry reported the issue to McDonald's and Paradox.ai on June 30; McDonald's changed the default credentials less than two hours later.
Dark Reading checked in with a number of security experts to see what lessons the incident might yield.
Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at zero-trust security vendor Keeper Security, tells Dark Reading that what McDonald's experienced was ""a failure of basic security hygiene.""
She also advises deploying AI-specific security tools, establishing AI security testing protocols, and creating incident response procedures for AI security events.
Randolph Barr, chef information security officer (CISO) at API and bot management vendor Cequence Security, tells Dark Reading as much.","McDonald's experienced a major security incident in June that resulted in the exposure of data belonging to approximately 64 million job applicants.

Earlier this month, security researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry detailed how they found major flaws within McDonald's hiring platform, McHire. The platform features an AI chatbot named Olivia, created by the company Paradox.ai.

After a few hours of testing the chatbot, Carroll and Curry found that the default credentials — ""123456"" in both the username and password fields — enabled them to access the administration interface for restaurant owners. This, in combination with an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) on an internal API, ""allowed us and anyone else with a McHire account and access to any inbox to retrieve the personal data of more than 64 million applicants,"" their blog post read.

Leaked data, depending on the applicant, included name, email, home address, phone number, candidacy state and form inputs (such as shifts available to work), and an ""auth token to log into the consumer UI as that user, leaking their raw chat messages and presumably other information.""

Carroll and Curry reported the issue to McDonald's and Paradox.ai on June 30; McDonald's changed the default credentials less than two hours later. Paradox.ai separately confirmed to the researchers all issues had been resolved on July 1, according to the blog post's timeline.

Although there is currently no reason to think someone with malicious intent accessed the data, personal information belonging to 64 million applicants constitutes a massive leak that should warrant reflection. Dark Reading checked in with a number of security experts to see what lessons the incident might yield.

Lesson 1: Change Your Default Credentials

Although the use of an AI chatbot to handle a large part of the application process may raise an eyebrow, the primary issue here is much more straightforward: Don't use your default password. This is especially applicable to other retail and food service businesses leaning on automation, but breaches and leaks stemming from default credentials are unfortunately all too common.

Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at zero-trust security vendor Keeper Security, tells Dark Reading that what McDonald's experienced was ""a failure of basic security hygiene."" As Guccione explains, failing to update default credentials, neglecting to enforce multifactor authentication, and poor access controls create an open door for potential criminals.

Or, as Varonis field CTO Stephen Frethem puts it, ""These days attackers aren't breaking in, they're logging in.""

""Organizations need to ensure identities are secure with complex passwords (ideally better than 123456), use multifactor authentication wherever possible, and track behavior around their access to data,"" Frethem says. ""We recommend regular assessments to determine what data is overexposed to all forms of AI — chatbots, LLM, and shadow/unsanctioned AI tools — and which identities are vulnerable to compromise. Data is dynamic, and companies must have processes in place to address the gaps as new data is created by humans and AI alike.""

Lesson 2: Lock Up Your AI

The incident is an opportunity to reflect on how these emerging technologies are being applied, and not just for food and retail organizations. First and foremost, new adopters must ensure technologies are being applied such this kind of exposure (and other common security issues) do not happen.

Willy Leichter, chief marketing officer at AI security vendor PointGuard AI, tells Dark Reading this new wave of LLM, machine learning, and similar automation-powered technologies is being applied to a wide range of use cases in retail and food service, such as customer recommendations, résumé screening, and alert triaging.

Aditi Gupta, senior manager of professional services consulting at application security vendor Black Duck, adds that this new wave of LLM technology is influencing ""all parts of business operations.""

""AI is used in summarizing procurement contracts, logistics and distribution systems, providing voice assistance and automation for in-store operations and back-office operations to name a few,"" she tells Dark Reading. ""Externally, AI is transforming how retail is interpreting customer data insights and uses it for marketing and influencing purchasing decisions. Agentic AI has also made personalized shopping experience more seamless and personalized.""

And because this technology is becoming so intertwined with the customer-facing experience, it's important to put security first.

""AI systems handling sensitive personal data must be managed with security at the forefront, including robust credential management, enforcing least-privilege access to the system and continuous monitoring,"" Keeper Security's Guccione says. ""Incidents like this serve as a stark reminder that neglecting basic security measures can put users and customers at risk and erode trust in both the organization and its AI solutions.""

Gupta recommends emphasizing vendor management and compliance as well as risk management. She also advises deploying AI-specific security tools, establishing AI security testing protocols, and creating incident response procedures for AI security events.

If that seems like a lot, consider starting at the most basic, foundational level of security hygiene. After all, that's why we're here in the first place. Randolph Barr, chef information security officer (CISO) at API and bot management vendor Cequence Security, tells Dark Reading as much.

""The McDonald's case highlights a critical truth: Before we even get to AI-specific risks, we have to get the fundamentals right,"" he says. ""What failed here wasn't some complex AI vulnerability — it was foundational security. Weak default credentials, no MFA, broken access control, and exposed endpoints are issues that have been on OWASP’s radar for over a decade.""

Barr gives retail organizations credit for starting to think about model protections, prompt injection, data leakage, and anomaly detection, but ""those efforts mean little if you haven’t locked down identity, access, and configuration at a foundational level,"" he adds. ""Security needs to be part of the development lifecycle from day one, not a bolt-on at launch.""",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt6d90778a997de1cd/blt846599607f5487d2/6876711151f65f266053118c/McDonalds_picturelibrary_Alamy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-15 18:09:08.774632

The company shared at last month’s American Diabetes Association’s 85th Scientific Sessions in Chicago that it planned to begin the launch of the highly anticipated twiist system. The initial launch comes with the Abbott FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus continuous glucose monitor (CGM) on July 7. With that launch underway, the Manchester, New Hampshire-based company has plans laid out for the next phases of the rollout.

Now available in select areas, twiist will become fully available across 44 U.S. territories in August. Sequel then anticipates full national availability in the fall, a spokesperson told Drug Delivery Business News via email today.

Sequel also inked a deal with Senseonics to pair the AID system with the Eversense 365 year-long implantable CGM. It expects to make that compatibility available in the next few months, the spokesperson said.

“This thoughtful, phased approach ensures a seamless experience with high-quality, strong clinical onboarding, user support, and provider readiness to match the strong interest twiist has already received following the announced collaborations with Abbott and Senseonics,” the spokesperson explained.

More about the Sequel Med Tech twiist AID system

Sequel built its twiist system on underlying drug delivery technology developed by DEKA R&D. Dean Kamen, co-founder of Sequel and founder of DEKA, commercialized the first wearable insulin pump for diabetes and last year said the twiist system “represents the next generation of insulin delivery.” Sequel won FDA clearance for twiist in March 2024.

Combined with the twiist Loop algorithm, the pump directly measures the volume of insulin delivered with every microdose. It offers the capability and flexibility to address each patient’s individual dosing needs. Sequel’s system utilizes sound waves that measure each pulse of insulin. This enables precision and helps understand exactly how much insulin the patient receives in a dose.

twiist features iiSure technology, which includes four checkpoints to provide accurate delivery and alert users to blockages quickly. Cleared for ages six and up with type 1 diabetes, the system offers a personalized way to manage the condition.

In addition to the Libre 3 Plus and Eversense 365 pairings, Sequel has another compatibility update lined up for the future. The company inked a deal with Abbott agreed with Abbott to pair twiist with the medtech giant’s future dual glucose-ketone sensor.",https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Abbott-FreeStyle-Libre-3-Plus-Sequel-Med-Tech-Twiist.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 17:09:05.500115

SLB shares were down 2.6% during midday trading.

The deal had faced issues with the CMA after it raised concerns about reduced competition in production chemicals and oilfield automation. To avoid a deeper Phase 2 investigation, SLB and ChampionX offered divestment of SLB’s U.K. production chemicals business and commercial remedies for ChampionX’s Quartzdyne business, including long-term supply agreements and IP licensing.

The deal helps strengthen SLB’s position in the production space by combining ChampionX’s expertise in production chemicals and artificial lift technologies with SLB’s global reach and digital capabilities.

Yet Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) is proving that supply chain discipline can transform these headwinds into a durable competitive advantage. By aggressively pruning its product portfolio and streamlining inventory, the denim giant has turned the tide against trade barriers and seasonal overstocking—a strategy that positions it as one of the most resilient plays in an industry struggling to adapt.

The Tariff Tightrope: Why Inventory Management is Now Survival

Apparel retailers face a dual crisis: punitive tariffs on Vietnamese and Chinese imports (Levi's largest production hubs) and the relentless pressure to clear inventory through discounts. The average apparel company's inventory turnover—a measure of how quickly stock is sold and replaced—has stagnated below 3.0 for years. Levi Strauss's 2024 inventory turnover of 2.05 (per fiscal 2024 reports) might seem unremarkable at first glance. But this metric tells a deeper story: the company is intentionally reducing SKUs to sell leaner, higher-demand assortments, avoiding the overstocking trap that forces peers into deep discounts.

The SKU Pruning Playbook: Less is More

Levi's strategy is ruthless in its focus on profitability over breadth. In 2024, the company cut 15% of its SKUs, eliminating underperforming styles like narrow-leg jeans and niche colorways. This “common assortment” approach—producing standardized items across markets—reduces supply chain complexity and tariff exposure. CFO Harmit Singh framed this as a “harder look at productivity,” but the data reveals the true calculus:

- SKU reduction + focus on top performers increased full-price sell-through to 90% of revenue in key markets (Q2 2025 results).

- Gross margins hit a record 62.6% in Q2 2025, up 140 basis points year-over-year, as markdown-driven margin erosion all but vanished.

The sale of Dockers to Authentic Brands Group for $311 million in 2024 wasn't just a balance sheet move—it freed resources to double down on high-margin core brands like Levi's denim and Beyond Yoga. This lean portfolio now accounts for 48% of revenue from direct-to-consumer channels, where full-price selling dominates.

Why This Creates a Moat in a Commodity Industry

Apparel retail is a commodity game where competitors chase trends, overproduce, and slash prices to survive. Levi's has redefined the rules:

1. Tariff Mitigation: By reducing SKUs, Levi's minimizes the number of styles subject to layered tariffs, lowering per-unit costs.

2. Demand Precision: A 30% global SKU reduction in tops (per Q4 2024 filings) aligned inventory with consumer preferences, cutting excess stock.

3. Margin Resilience: While peers like PVH (owner of Calvin Klein) face inventory write-downs, Levi's adjusted EBIT margin expanded 120 basis points in 2024 to 13.4%, proving profitability can grow even amid macro headwinds.

Investment Thesis: A Lean Machine in a Chaotic Industry

Levi's supply chain discipline isn't just about surviving tariffs—it's a template for thriving in retail's “new normal.” Key catalysts to watch:

- Continued SKU rationalization: Management aims to further streamline assortments, with Beyond Yoga's 8% Q4 revenue growth signaling untapped potential in its fastest-growing segment.

- Full-price premium positioning: The brand's cultural relevance (e.g., Beyoncé's “Levii's Jeans” campaign) allows it to command price premiums without markdowns.

- Cash flow sustainability: Free cash flow hit $648 million in 2024, up 15%, as lean inventory policies reduce working capital demands.

Investors should view dips as buying opportunities. At a forward P/E of 18x, Levi's trades at a discount to athleisure peers like Lululemon (LULU, 34x) while offering stronger margin stability. The $18–$20 price target (based on 20x 2025 EPS estimates) leaves room for upside as its strategy matures.

Final Verdict: Levi's is More Than Denim—It's a Supply Chain Masterclass

In an industry where markdowns and overstocking are synonymous with retail, Levi Strauss has engineered a moat through surgical supply chain optimization. By turning SKU reduction into a profit lever and tariffs into a filter for irrelevant SKUs, it's building a model that's both recession-resistant and growth-oriented. For investors, this is a rare apparel play where discipline—not discounts—fuels returns.

The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects.
About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods.
Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that “encourages” them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January.","Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.

The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects.

In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.

“This is a Renaissance moment for health in America,” U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.

About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association.

The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn’t identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.

The national focus on artificial food dyes is “a good step to take,” but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.

“Just taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,” she said. “It still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.”

However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called “a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.”

The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.

Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children.

The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that “most children have no adverse effects” when consuming foods made with them.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods.

In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.

The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday.

Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.

Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that “encourages” them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January.

Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.

Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won’t guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.

“Talk is cheap,” Galligan said. “It’s easy for companies to make promises to look like they’re being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108196053.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-07-15 18:08:46.991486

(SLP) reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, which expanded 66.7% year over year. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents per share.

Quarterly revenues jumped 10% year over year to $20.4 million, driven by continued momentum across its software and services business segments, along with a $2.4 million boost from the Pro-ficiency acquisition. In June 2024, SLP acquired Pro-ficiency to expand into clinical operations, leveraging its science, technology and predictive analytics to help clients reduce clinical trial failures. This deal doubled its total addressable market (TAM) and set up for strong growth, as better use of predictive tech is seen as key to improving drug development.

However, organic revenue fell 4%, mainly due to reduced QSP/QST software sales and a decline in its biosimulation services revenue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue was pegged at $19.5 million.

One of the most important developments during the quarter was the company’s strategic reorganization. Simulations Plus transitioned from a business unit structure to a functionally-driven operating model, completing a multi-year transformation aimed at streamlining operations, unlocking cross-team synergies and focusing resources on high-growth areas. This restructuring also involved adjusting staffing levels and revamping service capacity to better match current client needs, an important step toward scalability and operational efficiency.

Furthermore, SLP announced a $1 million investment in Nurocor, a cloud-based software company transforming the clinical development process for pharmaceutical companies. The investment is being made under the Simulations Plus Corporate Development Initiative, launched in 2024. This initiative targets early-stage technology companies with strong growth potential and disruptive capabilities within pharma and biotech.

The clinical trial technology and services sector was estimated at $25.7 billion in 2024, with a projected CAGR of 15.5% from 2025 to 2030. This growth is driven by the rising adoption of digital health technologies, increasing pressure to streamline trial processes and the need for faster and more efficient patient recruitment. With Nurocor's digital platform and SLP’s modeling and simulation capabilities, both companies are well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of this growing market.

Despite macroeconomic challenges affecting client behavior, the company remains committed to innovation. A major focus moving forward will be a suite of new AI-driven capabilities being integrated across its product lines. By incorporating AI into its core offerings, the company aims to differentiate itself in a competitive market and strengthen its leadership in model-informed drug development—a methodology increasingly adopted by regulators and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Following the announcement, SLP’s shares went up 3% in trading and closed the session at $17.47 on July 14, 2025. Shares of the company have lost 41.5% in the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Software industry's growth of 16.3%.

SLP’s Quarter in Details

Fiscal third-quarter revenues from Software (62% of total quarterly revenues) rose 6% year over year to $12.6 million, led by continued adoption of its ADMET Predictor, with GastroPlus and MonolixSuite also contributing positively. However, the segment saw headwinds from declining QSP/QST biosimulation software usage. GastroPlus, MonolixSuite, ADMET Predictor, Pro-ficiency and QSP/QST products contributed 56%, 17%, 20%, 3% and 4%, respectively, to total software revenues. SLP added 18 new customers and had eight upsells in the fiscal quarter for MonolixSuite.

The renewal rate for commercial customers was 71% (based on accounts) and 84% (based on fees) compared with 86% and 93% in the prior-year quarter, respectively.

Services’ revenues (38%) improved 17% to $7.7 million, driven largely by Medical Communications services, despite other areas within the segment experiencing softness. These weaknesses were attributed to cautious spending, delayed projects and cancellations from BioPharma clients, reflecting broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Sales of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetics and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology saw declines of 10% and 22% year over year, respectively.

SLP maintains a solid pipeline of service projects, though the pace of contractual commitments slowed in the third quarter. Additionally, some backlog work has been deferred to future periods. The company closed the quarter with a backlog of $20.7 million, up from $20.4 million in the previous quarter and $15.7 million a year ago.

SLP’s Operating Details

The gross margin in the quarter under review was 64% compared with 71.5% in the prior-year quarter. The Software segment’s gross margin was 80% compared with 88% a year ago. Services’ gross margin was 38%, down from 41%. The overall fall in gross margin was due to a $2 million rise in cost of revenues, with $1.1 million tied to software costs and $0.9 million to service costs.

Total operating expenses (49% of revenues) jumped 667% to $87.3 million. The rise was due to a one-time non-cash impairment charge of $77.2 million, a strategic decision to align the book value of assets with current market valuations.

Loss from operations was $74.2 million against income of $1.9 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA reached $7.4 million, equating to 37% of total revenue, up from 30% in the prior-year quarter.

SLP’s Liquidity

As of May 31, 2025, cash and short-term investments were $28.5 million compared with $21.5 million as of Feb. 28, 2024.

Cash flow from operations in the fiscal third quarter amounted to $8.14 million compared with $5.7 million a year ago.

SLP Cuts Fiscal 2025 Guidance

The Pro-ficiency training platform and Medical Communication services have been significantly affected by market challenges that delayed clinical trial initiations and reduced spending on commercialization, similar to the issues experienced in SLP’s biosimulation segment. As a result, the revenue outlook for these sectors has been lowered for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026.

SLP also faced a major client cancellation this quarter, linked to setbacks in the client’s drug programs, which reduced near-term revenue by approximately $2 million. Along with other challenges, this greatly affected quarterly results and will influence the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2026. The weaker-than-expected services revenue also led to a downward revision of the full-year 2025 guidance.

For fiscal 2025, it now expects revenues to be between $76 million and $80 million, up 9-14% year over year. The prior view was $90-$93 million with an increase of 28-33%. The Pro-ficiency acquisition is now expected to contribute an additional $9-$12 million to revenues compared with $15-$18 million projected earlier. The company continues to expect the Software segment mix to be 55-60% of total revenues.

SLP now estimates adjusted earnings per share to be in the band of 93 cents to $1.06 and adjusted EBITDA margin between 23% and 27%. Earlier, it projected earnings per share to be between $1.07 and $1.20 and adjusted EBITDA margin between 31% and 33%.

The recall includes all flavors and package sizes of YoCrunch® products currently on the market, including varieties topped with granola, M&M’s, OREO cookies, Snickers, Twix, and cookie dough. A full list of affected UPCs and expiration dates is available through the FDA and company resources.

In Ellendale, North Dakota, Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 campus has become a case study in what rural revitalization through technology investment can look like.

But what does it take to truly “build with a town”—to become part of a community, rather than simply operate within it?

In the third episode of Architects of Acceleration, host Philbert Shih, Founder of Structure Research, sits down with Nick Phillips, EVP of External Affairs at Applied Digital, and Jim Grueneich, North Dakota State Representative. The discussion dives into the human side of building a next-generation AI facility—how Applied Digital embedded itself in the Ellendale community, supported workforce development, addressed infrastructure gaps, and created a two-way street of economic opportunity and civic pride.

The key topics of discussion…

Economic Ripple Effects: Ellendale has seen a surge in local business activity, property values, and sales tax revenue—property tax base alone jumped from $75M to over $129M after Applied Digital’s arrival.

Levi's is optimizing inventory toward consumer favorites — like those wide-leg jeans and nostalgic women's styles, e.g., ""jorts"" and ""quiet Western"" looks.","It's hard to keep track of what's happening with tariffs these days, probably because it seems as if there's been a new tariff-related strategy revealed every week.

For a few months, it seemed like President Donald Trump was bluffing on tariffs, but as of today, it looks like he's serious, and the president's decisions are transforming business decisions and trade around the world.

He said he plans to raise tariffs on some of America's biggest trade partners, including the European Union, Brazil, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, the UK, and Thailand.

If the tariffs go into effect on August 1 — the date the president announced — the average tariff rate will increase to 20.6%.

This is the highest rate since 1910 and is higher than the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which worsened the Great Depression, according to the Yale Budget Lab July 14, 2025 report.

This is all happening as retailers plan for the looming 2025 holiday shopping season.

On its July 10, 2025, earnings call, Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) revealed how the company plans to offset tariff-driven cost pressures.

Levi's inventory ahead of the holidays

The company is ""taking a hard look at productivity in our assortments,"" strategically eliminating low-volume SKUs to streamline operations, Levi's CFO Harmit Singh said on the earnings call.

Levi's will reduce less-popular styles and colors, which will ensure tighter inventory and reduce the need for markdowns. A leaner product mix will reduce the need for steep holiday discounts, company leadership said.

CEO Michelle Gass emphasized the brand's broader shift — from denim bottoms to a full head-to-toe lifestyle brand, highlighting strength in direct-to-consumer, Europe growth, and product expansion.

She also said the company is doing its part and ""absorbing some of the costs"" related to tariffs.

Levi's SKUs reduction is about flexibility as much as pruning. Singh noted the company's move to a ""common assortment,"" enabling faster product deployment across markets and greater agility in responding to changing demand patterns.

The company reported its 13th consecutive quarter of direct-to-consumer growth.

Levi's second-quarter performance surpassed expectations, in part thanks to sales of wide-leg jeans for women, which have been trending for the last couple of years.

Revenue reached $1.45 billion (a 6% YoY rise), and the quarterly adjusted earnings of $0.22 per share outperformed Wall Street's $0.13 estimate.

The momentum allowed the company to raise its fiscal-year guidance. It now anticipates 1–2% revenue growth and EPS in the $1.25–$1.30 range, up from prior forecasts of flat or slight declines.

Tariff pressures vs. holiday forecasts

Threatened tariffs make shipping costs a major concern. Levi's estimates that the tariffs on one container of product could tack tens of thousands of dollars onto cost.

Levi's is also diversifying its supply chain. The company sources heavily from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, with China representing just about 1% of its U.S. imports.

This helps buffer against geopolitical tariffs and positions the company better in an uncertain trade landscape.

The market rewarded these moves. Following its quarterly results, Levi's stock jumped over 7% in pre‑market and after‑hours trading.

Dana Telsey, a research analyst who covers retail, described the results as ""impressive"" during the Q&A portion of the call, citing the successful shift toward a direct‑to‑consumer model and streamlined offerings.

Levi's move reflects a broader retail trend: more focused product lines. Levi's is optimizing inventory toward consumer favorites — like those wide-leg jeans and nostalgic women's styles, e.g., ""jorts"" and ""quiet Western"" looks.

The company is finding ways to minimize tariff impacts and keep in step with evolving fashion trends. This dual focus on efficiency and style gives Levi's a competitive edge.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgwMTk3NTM1MjgzOTQ2NjE4/levis_6.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 16:13:21.222987

However, shares of Albertsons fell 5% as it left its annual adjusted profit outlook unchanged, with first-quarter gross margin dropping to 27.1% from 27.8% a year ago, due to higher delivery and handling costs and investments.

'Competitive Price Gaps'

""The main concern remains the company's ability to manage inflationary overhead expense including labor costs, while reinvesting back into customer value proposition and narrowing competitive price gaps,"" said Michael Montani, analyst with Evercore ISI.

Several companies, including retail giant Walmart, have refrained from providing forecasts or pulled back in the light of rising tariff pressures.

Although Angel City continues to rake in business wins, its fast start in 2025 on the pitch has turned sour.
Angel City has built a reputation for pushing boundaries off the pitch.","Angel City has hired veteran marketer Julia Victor as its first chief marketing officer.

The new CMO will oversee ACFC’s branding, marketing and sponsorship efforts, and will work closely with the team’s president of business operations Carmen Bona, who joined the club in February.

Victor comes to the NWSL’s most valuable club from 2K Games, where she was the general manager and vice president of publishing. In that role, she oversaw the marketing and commercial efforts around the gaming company’s intellectual property. Before joining 2K, she worked at Electronic Arts as the global head of marketing for The Sims as well as EA’s lifestyle games. She also worked in multiple divisions at Nike, running marketing campaigns for Nike Running, Nike Los Angeles and Nike Kids before transitioning to the gaming world.

In Sportico’s 2024 NWSL team valuations, Angel City ranked second in the league in revenue after generating $35.4 million in a year. The club has since racked up several major sponsorships. NYX Professional Makeup became the team’s sleeve partner in November, replacing the footwear brand Birdies. In February, CarMax, the used car retailer with a growing marketing portfolio in women’s sports, signed on as the presenting partner for ACFC’s season ticket program.

Victor played college soccer at Marquette, earning an All-Big East Third Team nod in her sophomore season in 2008. She played professionally for the Chicago Red 11 in the original incarnation of the USL W-League.

Although Angel City continues to rake in business wins, its fast start in 2025 on the pitch has turned sour. ACFC entered the midseason break with just 15 points on the season—three points out of a playoff spot—with a 4-3-6 record.

This is the first full season under new ownership after Willow Bay and Bob Iger purchased the control shares of the team last September. Angel City remains at the top of Sportico’s NWSL valuations table at $250 million. The hirings of Bona and Victor are part of Bay and Iger’s planned $50 million additional investment into the team’s facilities and personnel. In January, ACFC opened its new training facility after doing a multimillion-dollar renovation of the Los Angeles Rams’ old facility.

Angel City has built a reputation for pushing boundaries off the pitch. Its initial ownership often acted more like a startup than a typical sports franchise, with numerous celebrity limited partners. Its helped valuation raced past the $100 million mark in April 2021. The club aggressively went for sponsors both native and new to the sports space in 2022, and booked $35 million in sponsorship revenue before its first game.

Yet it also has been fined for salary cap violations, including a $200,000 fine and three-point deduction last season after a league investigation revealed that the team made undisclosed benefits to several players in 2023.",https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Victor_Angel_City.png?w=1024,N,,2025-07-15 16:13:30.259451

AI Adoption Hotspots and Gaps

AI adoption is far from uniform across industries – some sectors are forging ahead, while others lag due to unique challenges. Here's a breakdown of which industries are leading in AI implementation and which are underpenetrated “blue oceans” for potential growth.

Finance: An early pioneer, the finance industry has a 72% adoption rate, mostly for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.

Healthcare: 94% of healthcare companies report using AI/ML in diagnostics and admin, but only 30% have scaled it.

Retail: Generative AI could unlock between $240 billion and $390 billion in annual economic value for retailers.

Manufacturing: Over 77% of manufacturers have implemented AI to some extent (up from 70% in 2023), with common applications being predictive maintenance, quality control via computer vision, and robotics/automation in production.

Marketing and advertising: 89% of marketers are already using AI tools in their workflows. From programmatic ad buying algorithms to generative AI content creation, marketing teams use AI for improved targeting, personalization, and efficiency.

Legal: AI adoption among legal professionals jumped from 19% in 2023 to 79% in 2024, yet only 8% have firm-wide AI integration (most use is pilot or individual-level).

AI Adoption by Region

Understanding the geographic differences in AI adoption helps for aligning strategies with market demand. Adoption patterns vary significantly by region, which brings unique opportunities and challenges for those looking to capitalize on AI growth.

Here’s the latest data:

North America: North American companies are at the forefront of AI adoption, with 40% of organizations surveyed by McKinsey reporting the use of generative AI in at least one business function. This region leads in both the scale and scope of AI implementations.

Europe: European companies are adopting AI at a slightly lower rate, with 30% reporting the use of generative AI in at least one business function, per McKinsey.

Africa: Africa presents a growing opportunity for AI adoption, with the potential to unlock up to $100 billion in annual economic value across multiple sectors from generative AI alone. However, the adoption rate remains lower compared to other regions.

It comes in response to a mission set forth by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove the artificial additives.
Why are companies ditching artificial dyes?
Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world’s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings.
“Most of these food dyes have been in our food supply for 100 years.","Video above: FDA announces in April 2025 that it will phase out food dyes.

(NEXSTAR) — Dozens of companies that make ice cream and frozen dairy desserts announced on Monday that they would remove artificial food dyes from their products by 2028, marking yet another voluntary move away from such food coloring within the food industry.

It comes in response to a mission set forth by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove the artificial additives.

Why are companies ditching artificial dyes?

In April, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would move to eliminate several synthetic dyes by the end of next year. That includes Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, and Blue 2. Red 3 was set to be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats; the FDA called for that deadline to move up.

The agency is relying largely on voluntary efforts by food manufacturers but also plans to establish a standard and timeline for the food industry to switch to natural alternatives and revoke authorization for dyes not in production. Additionally, the FDA said it would authorize four new natural color additives.

Which companies have said they’ll stop using dyes?

Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world’s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.

Among those that have recently announced plans to ditch synthetic colors are General Mills, Pepsico, ConAgra, Nestle, McCormick, Tyson Foods, Sam’s Club, JM Smucker, Hershey, and Kraft Heinz. In-N-Out confirmed to Nexstar’s KLTA in May that it was removing artificial coloring from some items.

Nonetheless, relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won’t guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.

“Talk is cheap,” Galligan said. “It’s easy for companies to make promises to look like they’re being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.”

Not every company is joining in. Mars, which makes Skittles and M&M’s, has been a hold-out, according to reports.

Are artificial dyes bad?

Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe — where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels — manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.

Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that “the totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.”

The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes.

Removing dyes from the food supply will not address the chief health problems that plague Americans, said Susan Mayne, a Yale University chronic disease expert and former director of the FDA’s food center.

“With every one of their announcements, they’re focusing in on something that’s not going to accomplish what they say it is,” Mayne said of Kennedy’s initiatives. “Most of these food dyes have been in our food supply for 100 years. … So why aren’t they driving toward reductions in things that do drive chronic disease rates?”

“The first half of 2025 saw severe allegations of abuse against migrant workers in global supply chains,” said Catriona Fraser, migrant rights researcher, Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, in a statement.
16% of companies were linked to more than one case of migrant worker abuse, with US-headquartered companies particularly likely to be linked to more than one case.
Abuses are primarily linked to high-income countries in the Global North but impact migrant workers from lower- and middle-income countries in the Global South.","A global organization, Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, reports that it found 445 allegations of migrant worker abuse recorded in the first half of 2025.

This number was an increase from 324 for the same period last year.

These allegations of abuse were linked to 327 identifiable companies, with 80 US-headquartered companies dominating the dataset. This was followed by companies headquartered in the UK (23), Taiwan (22), Germany (18), Brazil (15) and China (15).

Companies most frequently named in the cases were Meta (8 cases), Starbucks (7), Levi Strauss (7) and VF Corporation (7).

“The first half of 2025 saw severe allegations of abuse against migrant workers in global supply chains,” said Catriona Fraser, migrant rights researcher, Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, in a statement. “The data points to a clear trend whereby the wealthiest nations – and the multinational corporations operating in them – are profiting from the exploited labour of migrants from the Global South. Labor rights violations by unscrupulous employers continue to widen the gulf between the richest and the poorest around the world.

“Particularly alarming is the high prevalence of workers facing barriers accessing remedy,” she continued. “Companies accused of abuse must be held accountable, including through mandatory human rights due diligence legislation that ensures migrants who have experienced exploitation can access remedy and justice.”

BHRRC data from the first half of 2025 revealed:

Many companies are repeat offenders. 16% of companies were linked to more than one case of migrant worker abuse, with US-headquartered companies particularly likely to be linked to more than one case.

Meta was linked to allegations of labor rights abuse of migrant content moderators by outsourced firms in Colombia, Germany, Ghana and Kenya, and the use of its social media platforms for exploitative recruitment.

A civil lawsuit filed against Starbucks named seven Brazilian coffee farms in Starbucks’ supply chain which subjected internal migrants from other areas of Brazil to severe labour rights violations, including conditions of forced labour.

VF Corporation and Levi Strauss were linked through alleged supply chain connections to several Taiwanese suppliers accused of abusing the rights of migrant workers from Southeast Asia. In total, Transparentem’s investigation found over 40 buyers had supply chain connections to nine purportedly exploitative Taiwanese suppliers. Levi Strauss was also linked to another Taiwanese supplier accused of migrant exploitation in a separate investigation.

Abuses are primarily linked to high-income countries in the Global North but impact migrant workers from lower- and middle-income countries in the Global South.

US companies dominate the dataset, accounting for just under a quarter (24%) of companies named in reporting (80 companies).

Abuses most commonly took place in the UK (45 cases). This was followed by Saudi Arabia (41), Taiwan (38) and the USA (37).

Migrant workers from India (49 cases), the Philippines (38) and Bangladesh (37) were most commonly impacted.

Wage theft was the most commonly reported allegation of abuse (145 cases), accounting for a third of the database. This was followed by barriers accessing remedy (115) and occupational health and safety violations (107).

Sector spotlights

The agri-food sector accounted for the highest number of allegations of abuse.

A total of 118 allegations of abuse of food supply chain workers were recorded in the first half of 2025.

This included allegations of abuse at all segments of the supply chain - on farms and fishing vessels (83 cases), in food and beverage processing and packaging (35 cases), and in food distribution and on shop floors (5 cases).

Workers most frequently reported wage theft (55), occupational health and safety violations (35) and barriers accessing remedy (30), including exposure to toxic chemicals and injuries from dangerous machinery. In one shocking case, a Guatemalan farmworkers’ pelvis broke following an accident on a Canadian farm, but his employer left him on the ground and refused to take him to hospital.

The construction sector accounted for the second highest number of allegations of abuse.","https://img.mhlnews.com/files/base/ebm/mhlnews/image/2025/07/687657a8fc672b4a244b06a9-map_of_world_46731026__jmeccadesign.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-07-15 18:09:04.943638

Kennedy announced in April that he had a voluntary “understanding” with the food industry to remove petroleum-based dyes by the end of 2026.

The group of producers, which represents more than 90 percent of ice cream sold in the U.S., pledged to eliminate the use of certified artificial colors Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 from ice cream and frozen dairy desserts.

The commitment applies to products made with real milk sold at food retail locations, not products made with nondairy ingredients and those made in-house at local businesses.

The IDFA noted artificial colors are safe for use in foods, but the group is looking to avoid sales disruptions because states are following Kennedy’s urging and are phasing out certified artificial colors in school foods.

“I am proud of ice cream makers and dairy foods companies for stepping up for American families by making this voluntary commitment to provide ice cream and frozen dairy treats without certified artificial colors,” Michael Dykes, president and CEO of IDFA, said in a statement. “Americans are passionate about their ice cream, and the IDFA Ice Cream Commitment will ensure wholesome, indulgent ice cream products made with real milk from American dairy farmers remain a special part of our lives as state and federal policies evolve.”

Kennedy has made removing artificial dyes from food a key priority of his “make America healthy again” movement.

Kennedy announced in April that he had a voluntary “understanding” with the food industry to remove petroleum-based dyes by the end of 2026. He has long blamed artificial additives in food for chronic health problems, including obesity and heart disease.

Companies like Kraft Heinz and Nestlé have already pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, about 40 percent of the food industry has committed to a voluntary phaseout.

“I applaud the International Dairy Foods Association for stepping up to eliminate certified artificial colors,” Kennedy said in a statement. “The American people have made it clear — they want real food, without chemicals. Together, we will Make America Healthy Again.”

During a press conference Monday, Kennedy said the Trump administration “wants to encourage Americans to take control of their health — to eat right, to have lifestyle changes that save us all. And that’s the patriotic thing to do, not only for our country but for every individual American. It’s a patriotic duty to keep ourselves healthy.”

Monday’s announcement came the same day the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of gardenia as a blue food coloring, the fourth color derived from natural sources the agency approved in the last two months.

Gardenia blue is derived from the fruit of the gardenia, a flowering evergreen.

The grocery chain reported a 2.5% year-over-year revenue increase to $24.89 billion, slightly surpassing expectations, driven by a 2.8% rise in identical sales. However, its EPS only beat estimates by a penny, marking one of its narrowest beats in over five years. On a positive note, Albertsons raised its guidance for identical sales growth to 2.00-2.75% from 1.50-2.50%.

Revenue growth in Q1 was fueled by robust identical sales, particularly through its digital platforms. E-commerce surged 25% year-over-year, comprising 9% of total grocery revenue, while its pharmacy and health platform grew by 20%.

The early increase in identical sales guidance indicates strong confidence from Albertsons. Companies typically avoid raising full-year guidance early to maintain flexibility for future quarters.

The rise in guidance is also supported by Albertsons' productivity agenda, aimed at generating $1.5 billion in savings by FY25-27 to counter inflationary pressures.

Despite the FY25 guidance increase, management warned that Q2 identical sales might fall at the lower end of expectations, with a gradual pickup anticipated in the second half of FY25.

The competitive landscape remains challenging, with increased promotional activities from competitors. Albertsons is focusing on loyalty programs, which grew 14% year-over-year, but faces pressure from mass club stores like Costco (COST, Financial) and Walmart (WMT, Financial).

Despite the positive sales growth and guidance revision, the stock's decline is likely due to the narrow EPS beat.

Why It Matters

Starbucks is the world's largest coffee shop chain, according to Statista, with the brand owning branches on every continent except Antarctica. According to figures released last summer, there are more than 38,000 stores worldwide.

However, the chain has faced struggles on various fronts since the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of worker strikes. A difficult 2024 forced the brand to close several locations in the United States this year.

Niccol is planning to revamp the company, introducing a new dress code and reducing the menu in the hope of improving customer service. Niccol has dubbed his mission the ""Back to Starbucks plan"" as he seeks a return to what originally made the company so successful.

However, some employees are unhappy about his changes. In May, more than 1,000 Starbucks baristas went on strike over an alleged corporate failure to ""staff our stores properly, give guaranteed hours to workers, pay us a living wage, or provide stipends to pay for this arbitrary dress code.""

What To Know

Niccol announced the new company rules in an open letter to employees on Monday, which was published on the brand's website.

""As we continue to execute our Back to Starbucks plan and work to turn around the business, I want to share important updates on behalf of our executive leadership team – specifically regarding in-office expectations and work locations for our support partners and people managers,"" Niccol said.

He gave relevant staff members a year to relocate to either Seattle or Toronto. Employees who are now required on-site four days each week have until ""the new fiscal year"" in October to prepare for the change.

""We will shift from required three-days in office to minimum of four-days in office. Common days will be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday; this applies to our Seattle and Toronto Support Centers as well as North America regional offices,"" he said.

""We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams. In February we asked all vp+ leaders working remotely to begin relocating to Seattle or Toronto. We are now extending this requirement to all Support Center people leaders who will be expected to be based in Seattle or Toronto within 12 months.""

He noted that individual employees working under those leaders would not be asked to relocate, but ""hiring for future roles and lateral moves will require partners to be Seattle or Toronto based."" Some ""in-market roles"" will remain subject to approval, he added.

Affected workers who choose not to relocate will be eligible for a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment, according to the Associated Press.

Fortune reported that Niccol himself was formerly remote, but has now bought a home in Seattle. When the CEO accepted the role last year, he was reportedly not required to relocate to Seattle because the company agreed to help him set up an office near his home in Newport Beach, California.

Instead, he was offered the use of a corporate jet whenever he needed to commute to Starbucks headquarters, the publication added.

What People Are Saying

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, in an open letter on the company's website: ""We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.

""We know your work may take you outside the office, including visiting stores, meeting suppliers, or other business travel. You should continue to go where you need to go to be successful. We also know you sometimes need to step out or leave early to attend an event at your kid's school, see the doctor, or handle other personal matters. That's expected and completely okay. But the default for support partners should be working in person, in a Starbucks office, alongside your team and cross-functional partners.""

Starbucks Workers United, on X on Monday: ""Short staffing, bad schedules, and low take-home pay are affecting Starbucks baristas across the country. Baristas in St Paul, MN spoke up to deliver a message to CEO Brian Niccol - the time for you to get back to work with us on fair union contracts is NOW!"" The group shared footage of a barista making a speech from behind the counter; he demanded a ""fair contract"" for staff as customers applauded.

What Happens Next

It remains to be seen how the new office-based rules will be received by employees, some of whom must now uproot their lives to relocate to a new city. Starbucks Workers United has not publicly responded to Niccol's letter as of Tuesday morning.

In the meantime, Niccol will continue trying to turn around Starbucks' fortunes, while the business community is likely to be watching to see whether his new office-day or city-location rules have a positive effect on the brand's trajectory.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2683490/starbucks-cup.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 15:17:46.206929

The news came in a company blog post late Monday, which stated that the U.S. government had “assured” Nvidia that licenses would be granted — and that the company “hopes to start deliveries soon.” Shares of the California-based chipmaker were up over 4% by midday Tuesday.

Huang also spoke about the coup on China’s state-run CGTN television network, in remarks shown on X.

“Today, I’m announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,” Huang told reporters in Beijing.

He added that half of the world’s AI researchers are in China. “It’s so innovative and dynamic here in China that it’s really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here,” he said.

Huang recently met with President Donald Trump and other U.S. policymakers — and is in Beijing this week to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials. The broadcast showed Huang meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, which Huang was attending. Nvidia is an exhibitor.

Nvidia has profited enormously from the rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.

Here’s what we know.

What is Nvidia’s H20 chip?

The H20 graphics processing unit, or GPU, is an advanced AI chip — a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But it’s less powerful than Nvidia’s top semiconductors today.

That’s because the H20 chip was developed to specifically comply with U.S. restrictions for exports of AI chips to China. Nvidia’s most advanced chips, which carry more computing power, are off-limits to the Chinese market.

Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. And in January, before Trump began his second term in office, President Joe Biden’s administration launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI — in an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.

Restrictions on sales of advanced chips to China have been central to the AI race between the world’s two largest economic powers, but such controls are also controversial. Proponents argue that these restrictions are necessary to slow China down enough to allow U.S. companies to keep their lead. Meanwhile, opponents say the export controls have loopholes — and could still spur innovation. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January particularly renewed concerns over how China might use advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.

What’s happened since Trump took office?

In April, the White House announced that it would restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China — as well as MI308 chips from rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices — with the Trump administration again citing national security.

At the time, Nvidia said these tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion — and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying Trump to reverse the restrictions since. They’ve argued that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a sector in one of the world’s largest markets for technology, and have also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China’s AI technology.

Monday’s announcement from Nvidia signals that its lobbying efforts paid off. White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks told Bloomberg on Tuesday that allowing Nvidia to restart Chinese sales of its H20 chip would help the U.S. better compete abroad — particularly with Chinese chipmaker Huawei Technologies.

Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Tuesday that the renewed sale of H20 chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets — and maintained that the administration was also reversing course from April’s restrictions because the U.S. still doesn’t sell China “our best stuff.”

Still, calls for restrictions on advanced chip exports to China have persisted among U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

Just last week, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Jim Banks wrote a letter to Huang noting that the hardware powering advanced AI “is of immense strategic importance” — and again warned that this kind of technology could be used to accelerate Beijing’s effort to modernize its military if exported freely. U.S. lawmakers have also proposed that chips subject to export controls should be tracked, to ensure they don’t end up in the wrong places.

Beyond export controls, California-based Nvidia — like other tech giants today — has been caught in the crosshairs of Trump’s tariff wars abroad, particularly amid America’s tit-for-tat levies with China. But Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China says it’s approving permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington has lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines.

Nvidia and its CEO have also garnered Trump’s favor in recent months. In April, the company announced that it would be producing its AI chips in the U.S. for the first time, starting with more than one million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test its specialized Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas.

Trump was quick to applaud Nvidia’s move. He introduced Huang as a “smart cookie” who was helping bring jobs to the U.S. at an “Investing in America” event held at the White House later that month.

Similar to Nvidia, AMD is now also poised to restart Chinese sales of its MI308 chips. The California-based company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press’ request for comment on Tuesday — but told multiple news outlets that the Commerce Department was moving forward with license applications for these exports to China, and that it plans to resume shipments as those licenses are approved.

Shipments totaled 63.225 million units in the April–June period, up from 60.541 million units in the same quarter last year.

“In the second quarter of 2025, enterprise demand outpaced consumer demand, underpinned by Windows 11 migrations and pandemic-era desktop renewals, while consumer refreshes slowed as buyers deferred purchases,” said Rishi Padhi, Research Principal at Gartner.

Lenovo retained its position as the world’s top PC vendor, commanding a 26.9 percent share of the global market. It was followed by HP Inc. with 22.3 percent, Dell with 15.6 percent, and Apple at 9 percent.

“There were no major changes in the top five vendor rankings worldwide in the second quarter of 2025; meanwhile, Lenovo saw a decent growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9 per cent YoY,” the report noted.

Among the top vendors, all except Dell posted shipment gains ranging from 3 percent to nearly 14 percent. Dell’s shipments dropped by 3 percent to 9.832 million units, down from 10.140 million units in Q2 2024.

Lenovo led with 17.038 million units shipped, followed by HP at 14.124 million units. Apple’s shipments came in at 5.699 million units.

Looking ahead, Gartner expects continued growth in the PC market, albeit at a slower pace. “PC shipments are forecast to rise 2.4% in 2025, propelled by a tariff-driven front-loaded inventory surge in the first half of 2025 in the U.S., and ongoing Windows 11 replacement cycles in the rest of the world,” Padhi said.

However, shipment growth is expected to flatten in the latter half of the year as vendors draw down existing stock, raising the potential for excess inventory by year-end. (Source: IANS)",https://indusbusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PC.png,N,,2025-07-15 19:09:10.023696

NATO head Mark Rutte is set to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, this week.","US inflation rose to its highest level in four months in June, suggesting that the effects of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are starting to show up in prices.

According to Labor Department statistics released Tuesday, the consumer price index increased by 0.3% for the month, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.7%.

So far, the levies have had a limited impact on inflation — a point Trump has repeatedly used to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates — partly due to declines in both new and used vehicle prices, travel costs, as well as businesses stockpiling goods before tariffs took effect.

Still, with higher tariffs set to take effect in August, economists said the June inflation data isn’t enough to prompt the Fed to cut rates early.

Israel said it struck tanks in southern Syria after fighting broke out between rival groups and the new Damascus regime.

Clashes between Bedouin tribespeople and Druze militias claimed dozens of lives, with reports saying that Syrian forces backed the Bedouins. Israel’s defense minister said it destroyed the tanks as a “warning” to Damascus that it would not allow harm to the Druze, many of whom live in Israel.

Since the fall of the Assad regime, Syria’s leaders have been keen to portray the country as modern and inclusive, and major powers have sought to support its transition from autocracy — Gulf nations are helping pay for reconstruction, and London reestablished official ties this month — but deep sectarian divisions remain.

China’s economy expanded more than expected in the second quarter, but analysts voiced worry over the country’s long-term prospects.

The 5.2% annual growth rate puts the world’s second-biggest economy on track to meet Beijing’s 2025 target. The latest figure was bolstered by exports that exceeded experts’ forecasts, as the Trump administration’s tariffs force China to pivot away from the US and sell to other markets instead.

Still, domestic consumption remains disappointing, property prices are falling, and investment rates are in decline, while the consequences of Washington’s protectionism are not yet clear. “The second half of the year could prove to be more challenging,” ING’s China chief economist warned.

US President Donald Trump’s tougher stance on Russia opened a new front in a trade war that has expanded to encompass global security.

Trump threatened secondary tariffs on any country trading with Moscow if the Kremlin did not agree to peace in Ukraine, potentially throwing the US into renewed conflict with China — which does $250 billion in annual trade with Russia — just as the two appeared to be reaching a rapprochement. Beijing said it would view any such sanctions as “coercion.”

US allies have not been spared either: Trump’s threat of 30% tariffs against the European Union drove Brussels to pull together a list of €72 billion worth of US goods that it would levy tariffs on in response.

Nvidia won Washington’s green light to resume sales of artificial intelligence chips to China, a surprising loosening of strict US curbs on Beijing in the AI race.

While a major boost for the semiconductor giant, the approvals apply only to Nvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed for the Chinese market; restrictions on the company’s most cutting-edge technology remain in place.

Though the reversal — the US had barred Nvidia in April from selling the immensely popular H20 to China — was largely driven by pleas from the company, it was viewed in Beijing as a gesture of good faith, The Wall Street Journal said, as trade talks between the superpowers grind on.

Meta plans to build several city-sized data centers in the US and overhaul its artificial intelligence strategy as it races to catch up with Big Tech rivals.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the sites, just one of which would cover “a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” with the first coming online next year.

Meta’s AI efforts have been disappointing, but Zuckerberg is intent on his models reaching superintelligence — AI that can outperform humans on every metric — and is throwing huge sums at hiring and infrastructure. The firm is also considering dropping its longstanding open-source strategy and has formed a dedicated superintelligence lab.

Measles cases in Europe and Central Asia surged to their highest levels this century because of falling immunization levels.

The World Health Organization’s European region, which includes some Asian countries, saw cases more than double from 2023 levels to almost 150,000 last year, while a child died of the virus in the UK. Vaccination rates in the region have fallen to 91%, significantly below the 95% needed for herd immunity, while coverage against other viruses is also down.

Though vaccine skepticism in the US has garnered attention, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr its most notable adherent, hesitancy is on the rise in other countries including the UK, where minority ethnic groups show particular skepticism.

The White House’s renewed trade threats are driving American allies to join forces against Washington, weeks before US tariffs are set to ramp up.

US President Donald Trump threatened 30% tariffs against the European Union and Mexico over the weekend, upending growing hopes for stability in Washington’s trade policy.

Brussels is looking to increase its engagement with other economies hit by the duties, Bloomberg reported, including deepening trade ties with Asian countries: It reached a preliminary agreement with Indonesia on Sunday.

Mexico, too, is considering its options, with one of the country’s former top diplomats suggesting a new trade deal between Canada, the EU, Mexico, and the UK. “In extreme times, extreme thinking,” he wrote.

US President Donald Trump unveiled a plan Monday to arm Ukraine, a sharp pivot after months of trying to draw Russia to the negotiating table.

The plan involves European nations buying American weapons that would then be transferred to Kyiv. Washington plans to send defensive systems, including the Patriot interceptors that Ukraine has long wished for.

Trump on Monday also threatened Russia with with “very severe tariffs” if a peace deal wasn’t reached within 50 days.

The moves reflect just how much the US leader has turned against his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in recent weeks: Trump spoke positively of Putin in his first term, and sought a rapprochement with Russia in the initial months of his second. “My conversations with him are very pleasant, and then the missiles go off at night,” Trump said Monday.

US forces trained alongside Australian and Japanese troops to prepare for a possible war with China, as Washington looks to combat what it sees as a growing threat from Beijing.

The drills came after the three countries signed a naval logistics deal and partnered with India to try to wean themselves off dependence on China for critical minerals.

Yet Washington’s efforts at building an anti-Beijing alliance are not without challenges: The White House has pushed for Canberra and Tokyo to outline plans for a potential US-China war over Taiwan, but Australia has rebuffed the demands. And a recent Asia tour by the US secretary of state — intended to project American dependability — was abruptly cut short, leaving regional allies frustrated.

Google spent $2.4 billion to hire the leaders of an artificial intelligence programming company, the latest big-ticket move in an intensifying AI talent war.

Windsurf’s CEO and co-founder will join Google DeepMind along with several top employees. Tech giants buying stakes in rivals attracts the attention of antitrust regulators, but hiring decisions do not, The New York Times reported; Google’s huge outlay is comparable to a soccer team paying a transfer fee to acquire a top player’s contract.

Meta, too, has been on a hiring spree recently, sometimes offering compensation packages of up to $100 million for top talent, as it tries to make up ground in the AI race.

South Africa’s president suspended the country’s police chief over accusations of abuse and corruption, but the move failed to assuage allies who wanted a firmer response.

The move comes amid mounting frustration with the country’s law enforcement, which for decades has faced allegations of abuse — including thousands of cases of a still-prevalent torture mechanism used during apartheid — and yet failed to reduce crime.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has “once again outsourced executive responsibility,” by getting a commission to look into the accusations, the leader of the ruling coalition’s second-biggest party said, while the Mail & Guardian’s editorial board lamented that if the latest allegations were true, “then there is no mistaking that we are living in a mafia state.”

Superman took off at the box office, scoring $217 million on its opening weekend despite backlash from conservative commentators.

Director James Gunn’s comments that the Man of Steel was “an immigrant” sparked ire on Fox News and online, with some calling the movie Superwoke. But reviews were largely positive (with several high-profile exceptions) and the criticism kept it in the news, possibly boosting ticket sales.

The strong performance is good news for its studio, Warner Bros., which had been on a bad run. Speculation had mounted that senior studio leaders would lose their jobs, but since April the company has had five big hits, including A Minecraft Movie and Sinners, and is feeling bullish once more.

NATO head Mark Rutte is set to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, this week.

The visit comes after Trump in a recent interview said that Washington would consider supplying weapons to Ukraine via NATO, and teased a “major statement” about Russia on Monday.

It could signal a U-turn from earlier this month, when the US temporarily froze some weapons shipments to Ukraine: The Pentagon’s top policy official, Elbridge Colby, suggested that Kyiv’s requests could stretch already-depleted US weapons stockpiles, and has long pushed for Washington to prioritize countering China instead of military commitments in Europe and the Middle East.

Economists are a little less gloomy about the possible fallout from US President Donald Trump’s trade and economic policies than they were three months ago, according to a Wall Street Journal survey.

Economists expect cooler inflation, stronger growth, and a lower risk of a recession this year, but they remain relatively downbeat, with the latest GDP growth prediction still half of what was expected in January.

“Despite numerous headwinds, the U.S. economy is proving stubbornly resilient,” one economist said, adding that “the mood has clearly shifted from bold to careful.”

The slightly more optimistic outlook comes as the US Treasury on Friday reported collecting more than $100 billion in customs duties in June.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told Russia’s foreign minister that Pyongyang would “unconditionally support” Moscow’s ambitions in Ukraine, state media reported.

South Korean intelligence officials have estimated that the North has sent Russia roughly 13,000 soldiers and millions of artillery shells, and Ukrainian officials believe as much as 40% of Russia’s ammunition now comes from North Korea, Bloomberg reported.

That high degree of cooperation will likely start to decline if the war in Ukraine ends, an analyst argued in Foreign Affairs: North Korea has little to offer Russia beyond munitions and troops, and their broader economies are “fundamentally incompatible.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Sunday downplayed US fears over his firm’s technology being abused by China, days ahead of his second trip to the country this year.

Huang told CNN that “we don’t have to worry about” China’s military using US-made technology because “they simply can’t rely on it.”

The tech CEO is expected to hold a media briefing in Beijing Wednesday that could offer more details on a new chip reportedly being designed for Chinese customers.

China is one of Nvidia’s biggest markets, accounting for 13% of its total sales for the fiscal year ending in January, even as Washington has placed increasingly restrictive limits on exports of Nvidia’s chips to the country.","https://img.semafor.com/c6b97d7b9f769614698089f982480ea1a8f52d48-7519x5015.jpg?rect=0,535,7519,3947&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-07-15 16:13:07.232281

Strong growth in pharmacy and digital sales helped drive identical sales growth of 2.8% for Albertsons in the first quarter of 2025, the company reported Tuesday.

The Boise, Idaho-based grocery retailer also reported strong adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations, taxes, and amortization) of $1.11 billion for the quarter.

“These results again demonstrate gradual and incremental progress against our five strategic priorities, which include driving customer growth and engagement through digital connection, growing our media collective, enhancing the customer value proposition, modernizing capabilities through technology, and driving transformational productivity,” Albertsons CEO Susan Morris said in the earnings call.

Ecommerce for the quarter grew 25% and made up 9% of the company’s total grocery revenue.

“This growth was again led by strong performance in our first party business, driven by award winning capabilities in our fully integrated mobile app, and supported by our FIVE STAR certification program,” she said.

Albertsons has introduced AI and interactive features in its mobile app, such as its new shop assist tool, “which enables a connected shopping experience that allows customers to communicate back and forth with our in-store associates throughout their order fulfillment process,” according to Morris.

She acknowledged that ecommerce penetration is below industry peers, but noted that it provides among the biggest opportunities for customer acquisition and retention.

Loyalty also grew in Q1 but at a slower pace than Albertsons’ ecommerce business—one of Albertsons’ four digital platforms identified by Morris. Calling loyalty a “key enabler of digital customer engagement and a rich source of data,” Morris said loyalty grew by 14% to 47 million members in Q1.

She added that nearly a third (30%) of engaged households are using the Albertsons “cash off” function through the grocer’s “for U” loyalty program, which Albertsons upgraded in April 2024. That upgrade included the automatic cash off option that enabled loyalty members to convert rewards points to cash off on their next purchase.

“Throughout 2025 we will continue to introduce compelling benefits that will attract new members, improve share of wallet and further enable marketing and monetization opportunities for the media collective,” Morris said. “We will also continue to simplify and expand the program to include strategic partnerships to offer even more value.”

Albertsons’ pharmacy digital platform also experienced strong growth in the first quarter with 20% year-over-year growth.

Albertsons, along with other major grocery retailers like Kroger, is seizing on the opportunity of major pharmacy retailers like Walgreens, Rite Aid, and CVS shuttering hundreds of stores across the nation.

Calling a pharmacy an integral part of Albertsons’ “Customers for Life” strategy, Morris said they continue to invest in the digital platform and launch omnichannel benefits both to attract new customers and convert grocery-only shoppers.

Integration of the mobile app for use in-store is the final digital platform where Albertsons is focusing its efforts.

“The shift toward industrial production using Multi Jet Fusion is not only real, but it’s accelerating at pace, and what Midlands 3D have built is a timely response to that growth,” said François Minec, VP & Global Head of Sales and Business Development at HP Additive Manufacturing Solutions. “The scale and the quality of output coming out of their new facility clearly demonstrate how additive manufacturing can deliver both lower costs and faster lead times at volume. It is a compelling example of how UK manufacturing is alive and thriving, and why doubling down on automation and end-to-end capability is exactly what this moment demands.

Midlands 3D has also invested in the automated ‘Powerfuse’ vapour smoothing system from DyeMansion. A new finishing option alongside deep dye coloring and Polyshot surfacing, this technology gives printed parts a smoother, stronger, scratch-resistant, and waterproof finish.

“We saw the tipping point where production manufacturing became a bigger part of the business than prototyping last year,” said Paul Moloney, Founder and MD of Midlands 3D. “We’re running hard to keep up with demand, and the dramatic expansion in both capacity and capability you see demonstrated here is the next big milestone. 3D print manufacturing is exploding right now, but there are so many industries who are still barely dipping their toes in the water. Being in the heart of the Midlands is a terrific location to support UK manufacturing, and we’re just getting started in terms of what is possible with additive manufacturing going forward.”

Midlands 3D’s customer-centric, consultative approach has made them a favored supplier across many industries, including consumer goods, automotive, healthcare, marine, and UAVs. “We love working with customers, helping them derive the most value from adopting the technology across their supply chain,” said Paul Moloney. “We operate an open-door policy and welcome customers to visit our facility, especially now [that] work on our new HQ is complete”.",https://www.voxelmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Midlands-3D-Open-Day-July-10-2025.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 20:08:16.787648

Michèle Boudria, current Canadian President & CEO to retire after 40 years with McDonald's

Annemarie Swijtink, Managing Director of McDonald's Netherlands, announced as successor

TORONTO, July 15, 2025 /CNW/ - McDonald's Canada today announced that Annemarie Swijtink, currently the Managing Director of McDonald's Netherlands, has been named President & Chief Executive Officer. Michèle Boudria, the current Canadian President & CEO, has announced her retirement after an impressive 40-year career with the company. The leadership changes will take effect on September 1, 2025.

Celebrating Michèle Boudria's 40-Year Legacy

Michèle has been a transformative leader during her career with McDonald's. Starting her journey with McDonald's in 1984 as a crew member in Quebec, Michèle has held various senior roles in both regional, national and international corporate offices, including as the Managing Director for the Netherlands, before becoming the first woman President & CEO of McDonald's Canada in 2022.

A people-first leader, Michèle has been instrumental in driving business results while cultivating a culture grounded in talent development, operational excellence, and purpose. Her legacy includes fostering strong partnerships with franchisees, advancing McDonald's purpose of feeding and fostering Canadian communities, and passionately advancing Inclusion initiatives across the organization.

""We extend our most sincere appreciation to Michèle as she embarks on her well-deserved retirement. Her remarkable, 40-year career at McDonald's has been nothing short of inspiring,"" says Manu Steijaert, President, International Operated Markets. ""Michèle's talent for nurturing trusted relationships has profoundly shaped the Canadian business. We are deeply grateful for her countless contributions and the close partnership we've shared. Michèle, you will always be a cherished part of the McDonald's family.""

Looking to the future: Annemarie Swijtink appointed McDonald's Canada President and CEO

Michèle is succeeded by Annemarie Swijtink, who joins McDonald's Canada from the Netherlands, where she is currently the Managing Director, a position she has held since June 2022.

Annemarie began her McDonald's career as crew and worked her way to the McDonald's Netherlands headquarters since 2006. Since that time, she has held progressively senior, strategic roles across Marketing, Digital Customer Engagement, Impact and Data Analytics.

""Having worked with Annemarie for many years, I've had the privilege of witnessing the impact she has had on our brand and our people,"" says Steijaert. ""Her leadership has not only led to the growth of the Dutch business, delivering exceptional results with regards to sales and market share, but her strategic vision and collaborative approach make her the perfect fit to build on the momentum and propel the brand in Canada into an exciting future.""

Annemarie is an enthusiastic and collaborative leader with a proven track record in strategy and execution. Highly valued by Dutch franchisees, her people-centered leadership has fostered strong relationships and driven talent and team growth. She brings to Canada a deep understanding of the McDonald's business, a passion for McDonald's guests and a commitment to collaboration.

""I am incredibly honoured to take on the role of President & CEO of McDonald's Canada. My journey with McDonald's began as a 15-year-old crew member in Deventer, and it has been a privilege to grow with this iconic brand over the years,"" says Swijtink. ""Moving from the Netherlands to Canada is an exciting new chapter for me and my family, and I am eager to become a part of the vibrant Canadian community. I look forward to meeting the talented team here and working together to continue building the bright future of McDonald's in Canada.""

A similar outcome for Kraft Heinz's split entities could catalyze a 29% upside from current prices, based on analyst estimates.
While Berkshire's exit isn't tied to strategic disagreements, its reduced influence allows Kraft Heinz to pursue a path unburdened by legacy shareholder preferences.
Final Take Kraft Heinz's split isn't just a cost-cutting move—it's a strategic rebirth.
Investors who bet on this transformation could reap rewards as the market finally values Kraft Heinz's crown jewels at their true worth.","The food giant's proposed split into two distinct entities—a high-growth sauces-and-condiments powerhouse and a commoditized grocery division—represents a bold pivot to address decades of stagnation. By slicing its portfolio into strategically aligned segments, Kraft Heinz aims to reposition itself as a nimble player in a market increasingly favoring health-conscious, premium products. The move, reminiscent of Kellogg's 2023 spinoff that unlocked $16 billion in shareholder value, could finally break the curse of its 2015 merger with Heinz—a deal that once carried a $140 billion price tag but now trades at just $31 billion.

The Split: A Clear Divide Between Winners and Losers

The proposed structure separates top-tier brands like Heinz ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Grey Poupon mustard—anchor products with strong global demand and premium pricing power—into a standalone entity. These brands dominate high-margin, growth-oriented categories such as sauces, snacks, and plant-based alternatives, which analysts project to grow at a 6.97% CAGR through 2025. Meanwhile, commoditized assets like Oscar Mayer meats, Velveeta cheese, and Maxwell House coffee—struggling with health-conscious consumer trends and private-label competition—are slated for a spin-off valued at up to $20 billion.

The rationale is straightforward: focus on what works. The company's 2024 results underscore the urgency—the 3% revenue decline and 63% operating profit drop highlight the drag of underperforming assets. By pruning these slower-growth segments, Kraft Heinz aims to free up capital to invest in innovation, such as its pledge to eliminate artificial colors by 2027, aligning with “clean label” demands.

Lessons from Kellogg's Playbook

The split mirrors Kellogg's 2023 demerger, which separated its cereal-focused WK Kellogg Co. from its snacks-and-beverage arm, Kellanova. Both entities saw their valuations rise as investors rewarded their clarity of focus. Similarly, Kraft Heinz's high-growth division could command a premium as a “pure-play” in sauces and condiments—a category with $207 billion in global sales and secular growth drivers like global cuisine trends.

The data shows that Kellanova's shares surged 40% in its first six months, while WK Kellogg Co. outperformed peers in the cereal sector. A similar outcome for Kraft Heinz's split entities could catalyze a 29% upside from current prices, based on analyst estimates.

The 3G Capital Factor: From Cost-Cutting to Strategic Agility

The split also reflects a shift in operational philosophy. The 3G Capital-led merger of 2015 prioritized margin-boosting cuts, but this approach eroded brand innovation and consumer trust. The new strategy, spearheaded by CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, signals a departure from austerity. By divesting non-core assets, the company can reinvest in R&D and marketing, critical to competing with agile startups and private-label rivals.

Meanwhile, the departure of Berkshire Hathaway from the board removes a vestige of the old regime. While Berkshire's exit isn't tied to strategic disagreements, its reduced influence allows Kraft Heinz to pursue a path unburdened by legacy shareholder preferences.

Risks and the Bull Case

Skeptics point to execution risks: spinning off a $20 billion division requires navigating labor unions, regulatory hurdles, and brand equity concerns. Additionally, the commoditized division's buyers—likely firms like McCormick—may demand concessions that dilute returns.

Yet the bull case is compelling. Separating the businesses could unlock $5 billion–$8 billion in synergies, per analyst models, while allowing each entity to pursue tailored strategies. The high-growth segment could attract premium multiples akin to Unilever's Foods division, which trades at 22x EBITDA, versus Kraft Heinz's current 9x.

Investment Thesis: A Buy on Valuation and Catalysts

For investors prioritizing resilience in the packaged goods sector, the split presents a high-conviction opportunity. Key catalysts include:

1. Final split details: A definitive timeline and valuation by Q3 2025.

2. Q3 earnings: A chance to confirm margin improvements in the sauces division.

3. Acquisition interest: Potential buyers for the commoditized assets could trigger a premium.

The stock's 58% decline from its 2017 peak leaves ample room for recovery. With a current valuation of $31 billion, the split could push the high-growth entity alone toward a $40 billion valuation—a 29% upside.

Final Take

Kraft Heinz's split isn't just a cost-cutting move—it's a strategic rebirth. By shedding commoditized baggage and focusing on high-margin growth, the company positions itself to thrive in a market demanding premium, health-focused products. Investors who bet on this transformation could reap rewards as the market finally values Kraft Heinz's crown jewels at their true worth.

Consider this a BUY with a 12-month price target of $34–$36 per share, contingent on split execution.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 20:08:46.939809

Kraft Heinz is poised to break itself up, acknowledging what investors have known for years: Their merger was a dud.

The 2015 deal united some of America’s most beloved grocery brands and was blessed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names, including Warren Buffett. But the company’s sales and share price floundered — the latter propped up largely by Buffett’s refusal to bail out of the stock.

What went wrong? Buffett admitted that Heinz overpaid for Kraft, and 3G’s vaunted budgetary axe turned out to be useless against decades of accumulated bloat.

The restructuring starts with EVP and Chief Merchandising and Digital Officer Omer Gajial, as he revealed that he’s leaving Albertsons to take on new opportunities outside the company. During his five years with the grocer, Gajial developed talent across high-performing teams to grow its digital, e-commerce and pharmacy businesses, expanded health- and-wellness solutions, and advanced merchandising and retail media capabilities – areas key to Albertsons’ success. He will be with the company through late August. Prior to Albertsons, Gajial held positions at Amazon and PepsiCo.

The culprit: Olivia, an AI chatbot from Paradox.ai, designed to handle job applications, collect personal information, and even conduct personality tests.
When basic measures like credential management, access controls, and even multi-factor authentication are missing, the entire security posture comes into question.
Simple safeguards—unique credentials, robust authentication, and proper access controls—were missing entirely.
Automated hiring systems, especially those powered by AI, are only as secure as the most basic controls.","If you’ve ever wondered what could go wrong with an AI-powered hiring system, McDonald’s just served up a cautionary tale. This week, security researchers revealed that the company’s McHire website—a recruitment platform used by over 90% of McDonald’s franchisees—left the personal information of millions of job applicants exposed to anyone with a browser and a little curiosity.

The culprit: Olivia, an AI chatbot from Paradox.ai, designed to handle job applications, collect personal information, and even conduct personality tests. On paper, it’s a vision of modern efficiency. In reality, the system was wide open due to security flaws so basic they’d be comical if the consequences weren’t so serious.

What Went Wrong?

It didn’t take a sophisticated hacker to find the holes. Researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry started investigating after Reddit users complained that Olivia gave nonsensical responses during the application process. After failing to find more complex vulnerabilities, the pair simply tried logging into the site’s backend using “123456” for both the username and password. In less than half an hour, they had access to nearly every applicant’s personal data—names, email addresses, phone numbers, and complete chat histories—with no multifactor authentication required.

Worse still, the researchers discovered that anyone could access records just by tweaking the ID numbers in the URL, exposing over 64 million unique applicant profiles. One compromised account had not even been used since 2019, yet remained active and linked to live data. As Carroll told Wired, “I just thought it was pretty uniquely dystopian compared to a normal hiring process, right? And that’s what made me want to look into it more.”

Why Security Fundamentals Still Matter

Experts agree that the real shock isn’t the technology itself—it’s the lack of security basics that made the breach possible. As Aditi Gupta of Black Duck noted, the McDonald’s incident was less a case of advanced hacking and more a “series of critical failures,” ranging from unchanged default credentials and inactive accounts left open for years, to missing access controls and weak monitoring. The result: an old admin account that hadn’t been touched since 2019 was all it took to unlock a massive trove of personal data.

For many in the industry, this raises bigger questions. Randolph Barr, CISO at Cequence Security, points out that the use of weak, guessable credentials like “123456” in a live production system is not just a technical slip—it signals deeper problems with security culture and governance. When basic measures like credential management, access controls, and even multi-factor authentication are missing, the entire security posture comes into question. If a security professional can spot these flaws in minutes, Barr says, “bad actors absolutely will—and they’ll be encouraged to dig deeper for other easy wins.”

And this isn’t just about AI or McDonald’s. Security missteps of this kind tend to follow each new “game-changing” technology. As PointGuard AI’s William Leichter observes, organizations often rush to deploy the latest tools, driven by hype and immediate gains, while seasoned security professionals get sidelined. It happened with cloud, and now, he says, “it’s AI’s turn: tools are being rolled out hastily, with immature controls and sloppy practices.”

Automation and the Illusion of Security

McDonald’s isn’t alone in betting big on AI to speed up hiring and make life easier for franchisees and HR teams. Automated chatbots like Olivia are supposed to streamline applications, assess candidates, and remove human bottlenecks. But as this incident shows, convenience can’t come at the expense of basic digital hygiene. Simple safeguards—unique credentials, robust authentication, and proper access controls—were missing entirely.

The rush to digitize and automate HR brings with it a false sense of security. When sensitive data is managed by machines, it’s easy to assume the system is secure. But technology is only as strong as the practices behind it.

Lessons for the Future

If there’s a lesson here, it’s that technology should never substitute for common sense.

Automated hiring systems, especially those powered by AI, are only as secure as the most basic controls. The ease with which researchers accessed the McHire backend shows that old problems—default passwords, missing MFA—are still some of the biggest threats, even in the age of chatbots.

Companies embracing automation need to build security into the foundations, not as an afterthought. And applicants should remember that behind every “friendly” AI bot is a company making choices about how to protect—or neglect—their privacy.

The Price of Convenience

The McDonald’s McHire data leak is a warning to every company automating hiring, and to every job seeker trusting a bot with their future. Technology can streamline the process, but it should never circumvent or subvert security.

What this month tells us Publicis is reshaping the media agency landscape with multibillion-dollar global account wins and an aggressive sweep of marquee accounts from rivals.
The data covers all 2025 account wins reported by COMvergence as of July 1, 2025.","Publicis Groupe and IPG held a significant lead on the other holding companies in the first half of 2025, thanks to global-level wins for Mars and Paramount, reflected in big billings in the U.S.

Publicis won Mars’ $1.7 billion global media account, while both Publicis and IPG picked up Paramount. The trend of wins being awarded at network and holding company level as opposed to agency level continued, with the aforementioned accounts picked up by Publicis Media and IPG Mediabrands.

July’s U.S. rankings also reflect a more volatile period for WPP, which was the incumbent of both accounts. WPP blamed “weaker new-business performance” as one of the reasons for its shock profit warning for Q2.

Publicis’ headline-grabbing Mars win alone catapults its net new-business billings beyond $2 billion, according to preliminary COMvergence data compiled by Campaign Red. This victory followed an eight-month global review pitting WPP, Publicis, Omnicom and IPG against one another.

Publicis won the bulk of the business, taking charge of media across 70 markets for iconic brands such as M&M’s, Snickers, Wrigley’s and Pedigree. The U.S. portion of the account is worth $571.4 million.

The move consolidates multiple Mars agency partners into Publicis’ bespoke integrated team dubbed One Mars, which will harness an AI-driven growth model to reshape the brand’s marketing strategy. The new contracts take effect Jan. 1.

Publicis also took over lead media agency duties for Paramount Pictures with the account worth $237.3 million in the U.S. The move unfolded amid the backdrop of the media and entertainment conglomerate’s pending $8 billion merger with Skydance Media.

Publicis’ only loss this year so far, according to COMvergence, has been the $114 million U.S. Olive Garden account, won by Havas Media.

Meanwhile, IPG Mediabrands capitalized on Paramount Global’s media agency shake-up, securing U.S. media duties for streaming services Paramount+ and Pluto TV, as well as TV properties such as CBS, BET, VH1 and Comedy Central — replacing incumbent Horizon Media.

This redistribution propelled IPG to second place among holding companies, with $485.9 million in net new business — still a distant second to Publicis (which maintains a commanding lead) but well ahead of third place Omnicom at $95.1 million.

On the agency front, Spark Foundry rose to second place with $276.2 million in net new business, fueled entirely by its Abbott win. Horizon Media fell to third after suffering $773 million in losses, primarily related to the Paramount split.

The rest of the agency leaderboard held steady, with no changes in rank below the top three.

What this month tells us

Publicis is reshaping the media agency landscape with multibillion-dollar global account wins and an aggressive sweep of marquee accounts from rivals.

WPP’s longstanding hold on key clients erodes amid a significant leadership transition.

IPG’s resurgence is powered by U.S. streaming and entertainment wins, namely Paramount Global, previously handled by Horizon Media.

The Mars win underscores the growing importance of integrated AI-driven marketing models and consolidation of agency partners.

Campaign Red has produced the U.S. media rankings, using direct findings from COMvergence, to calculate the overall media billings sum of each agency, taking into account both wins and losses for the period. The formula is now wins–losses; retentions are no longer included as the focus has shifted to new money coming into the business. Readers will still be able to view retentions in a separate column in our tables.

July refers to the publishing month of the rankings by Campaign. The data covers all 2025 account wins reported by COMvergence as of July 1, 2025. Next month’s rankings (August) will include accounts reported after this date. Reported figures may be revised in the future as more information becomes available.

As an increasing number of wins are taking place at group level, we will produce a new holding group table, which will aggregate a holding company's media wins and will include those shown in the agency table.

Restrictions on sales of advanced chips to China have been central to the AI race between the world's two largest economic powers, but such controls are also controversial.
The emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot in January particularly renewed concerns over how China might use advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.","BANGKOK — (AP) — Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang says the technology giant has won approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence to China.

The news came in a company blog post late Monday, which stated that the U.S. government had “assured"" Nvidia that licenses would be granted — and that the company “hopes to start deliveries soon.” Shares of the California-based chipmaker were up over 4% by midday Tuesday.

Huang also spoke about the coup on China’s state-run CGTN television network, in remarks shown on X.

“Today, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,” Huang told reporters in Beijing.

He added that half of the world's AI researchers are in China. “It's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here,"" he said.

Huang recently met with President Donald Trump and other U.S. policymakers — and is in Beijing this week to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials. The broadcast showed Huang meeting with Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for Promotion of International Trade, host of the China International Supply Chain Expo, which Huang was attending. Nvidia is an exhibitor.

Nvidia has profited enormously from the rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.

Here's what we know.

The H20 graphics processing unit, or GPU, is an advanced AI chip — a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But it's less powerful than Nvidia's top semiconductors today.

That's because the H20 chip was developed to specifically comply with U.S. restrictions for exports of AI chips to China. Nvidia's most advanced chips, which carry more computing power, are off-limits to the Chinese market.

Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. And in January, before Trump began his second term in office, President Joe Biden's administration launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI — in an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.

Restrictions on sales of advanced chips to China have been central to the AI race between the world's two largest economic powers, but such controls are also controversial. Proponents argue that these restrictions are necessary to slow China down enough to allow U.S. companies to keep their lead. Meanwhile, opponents say the export controls have loopholes — and could still spur innovation. The emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot in January particularly renewed concerns over how China might use advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.

In April, just months after Trump took office, the White House announced that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips to China — as well as MI308 chips from rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.

At the time, the Trump administration again cited national security. But Nvidia said these tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion — and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying Trump to reverse the restrictions since. They've argued that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a sector in one of the world’s largest markets for technology, and have also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China’s AI technology.

Monday's announcement from Nvidia signals that its lobbying efforts paid off. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Tuesday that the renewed sale of H20 chips in China was linked to a trade agreement made between the two countries on rare earth magnets — and maintained that the administration was also reversing course from April's restrictions because the U.S. still doesn't sell China ""our best stuff.""

Still, the exact timing of the H20 chip's re-entry into the Chinese market remains unknown. It's also unclear whether AMD will similarly see restrictions lifted for its MI308 chips. AMD didn’t immediately return an emailed request for comment Tuesday about how Trump’s policies would affect its chip sales.

Meanwhile, calls for restrictions on advanced chip exports to China have persisted among U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

Just last week, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Jim Banks wrote a letter to Huang noting that the hardware powering advanced AI “is of immense strategic importance"" — and again warned that this kind of technology could be used to accelerate Beijing’s effort to modernize its military if exported freely. U.S. lawmakers have also proposed that chips subject to export controls should be tracked, to ensure they don’t end up in the wrong places.

Beyond export controls, California-based Nvidia — like other tech giants today — has been caught in the crosshairs of Trump's tariff wars abroad, particularly amid America's tit-for-tat levies with China. But Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China says it's approving permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington has lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines.

Nvidia and its CEO have also garnered Trump's favor in recent months. In April, the company announced that it would be producing its AI chips in the U.S. for the first time, starting with more than one million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test its specialized Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas.

Trump was quick to applaud Nvidia's move. He introduced Huang as a ""smart cookie"" who was helping bring jobs to the U.S. at an ""Investing in America"" event held at the White House later that month.

Shipt criticized the City Council committee for drafting the bills without input from grocery delivery workers.","Grocery delivery workers in New York City may soon receive higher compensation.

A New York City Council committee advanced bills requiring third-party companies like Instacart and Shipt to increase delivery payments, CBS News reports.

The measures would raise the minimum wage to $21.44, ensure workers are paid within seven days after the pay period ends, guarantee the option of at least a 10% tip before customers place an order, and require companies to pay workers for all on-the-clock time, even when they are not making deliveries.

The bills now move to the full New York City Council for a vote.

If passed, the legislation would align last-mile grocery delivery workers' pay with that of restaurant delivery workers, CBS said.

In response to the proposed wage increase, DoorDash announced it would raise fees for customers and restaurant partners in New York City.

DoorDash, Uber, and Grubhub sued to block the wage hike, but the New York Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit.

Instacart and Shipt oppose the bills. Instacart cited city data suggesting the legislation would raise grocery delivery costs by 46% and increase fees for local grocers.

“It’s simply unconscionable that the City Council is considering a bill that would jeopardize a lifeline thousands of New Yorkers rely on, particularly those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges,” Instacart said in a statement.

Shipt criticized the City Council committee for drafting the bills without input from grocery delivery workers.

“Passing these bills as drafted could lead to unintended consequences that hurt both the very workers they aim to protect and the families that depend on grocery delivery,” Shipt said in a statement.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/blt4b812551267df520/68768ca3ca36bc5b4526fc7a/A_grocery_delivery_workers_holding_a_bag_of_groceries.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-15 15:16:10.067172

Identical sales rose 2.8% for the 16-week quarter ended June 14, prompting the grocery retailer to raise its full-year sales outlook.

Net sales grew 2.5% to $24.88 billion, while digital sales surged 25%, now accounting for 9% of the company’s grocery revenue. Membership in the company’s loyalty program climbed 14% year over year to 47.3 million, as consumers responded to enhanced digital tools and value offerings.

Net income was $236 million, or $0.41 per share, while adjusted net income came in at $319 million, or $0.55 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.11 billion, representing 4.5% of revenue.

“We delivered solid operating and financial performance while investing in our core operations and enhancing our customer value proposition,” said CEO Susan Morris during the company’s earnings call. “Our Customers for Life strategy continues to guide our investments in digital engagement, private brands, and productivity improvements.”

Digital Nears Breakeven; Pharmacy Posts 20% Growth

Albertsons made substantial progress on its five key strategic pillars: digital engagement, media growth, customer value, tech modernization, and productivity transformation. E-commerce grew 25% year-over-year, with Morris noting that the business is now “near breakeven and improving.”

Pharmacy sales were a standout, growing 20% versus the prior year and contributing significantly to the identical sales gain. Morris also spotlighted new digital tools like a “shop assist” feature and enhanced basket flexibility, as well as new private-label launches, including Overjoyed (health and wellness) and Chef’s Counter (fresh prepared meals).

Margins Compressed by Value Investments and Channel Mix

Gross margin declined to 27.1%, down 70 basis points year over year and 85 basis points when excluding fuel and LIFO impacts. CFO Sharon McCollam attributed the pressure to increased investments in value, mix shifts due to strong pharmacy and digital growth (which carry lower margins), and elevated delivery costs. However, these were partially offset by reductions in shrink and operating efficiencies.

Selling and administrative expenses declined to 25.4% of sales, down 63 basis points excluding fuel. McCollam credited the improvement to productivity gains, operating leverage, and lower merger-related costs, despite continued inflation and higher labor costs.

Capital Allocation: Investments Continue

Albertsons invested $585 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, completing 36 remodels, opening three new stores, and continuing to modernize its digital and tech infrastructure. The company returned $401 million to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 14.2 million shares.

Albertsons also completed a $600 million debt refinancing in March, reducing interest costs and extending maturities. Net interest expense declined to $141.8 million from $145.7 million a year ago.

Fiscal 2025 Outlook Raised for Identical Sales

The company raised its full-year identical sales growth forecast to a range of 2.0% to 2.75%, up from its prior range of 1.5% to 2.5%. Guidance for adjusted EBITDA ($3.8 billion to $3.9 billion), adjusted EPS ($2.03 to $2.16), and capital expenditures ($1.7 billion to $1.9 billion) remain unchanged.

McCollam said the company expects second-quarter identical sales to land at the low end of the new range, with momentum building in the back half of the year. “We continue to execute against our long-term algorithm of 2%+ identical sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2026,” she added.

Labor negotiations remain ongoing, with roughly 120,000 associates affected; Morris noted that nearly half are now covered under newly ratified contracts.

By Meryl Kao / Staff reporter

Asustek Computer Inc’s (華碩) PC shipments increased 8.6 percent year-on-year to 4.49 million units in the second quarter, driven by US tariff-related inventory buildup and desktop system upgrades, market researcher Gartner Inc said in a report on Monday.

The company secured a 7.1 percent share of the global market in the second quarter, ranking fifth place ahead of Acer Inc (宏碁), but trailing behind Lenovo Group Ltd (聯想), HP Inc, Dell Technologies Inc and Apple Inc, Gartner said.

Among the top five, only Dell saw a decline in shipments in the second quarter, down 3 percent year-on-year to 9.83 units, the researcher said.

Overall, global PC shipments rose 4.43 percent to 63.23 million units in the second quarter, from 60.54 million units a year earlier, it said.

The figure also grew 7.26 percent from the previous quarter.

The growth in global PC shipments in the second quarter was mostly driven by enterprise demand due to the upcoming end of service for Microsoft Corp’s Windows 10 operating system and a post-COVID-19 upgrade cycle, Gartner said.

In contrast, consumer refreshes slowed in the quarter, and many organizations chose to upgrade existing devices rather than purchase new ones with Windows 11, it said.

By region, shipments to North America dipped 0.5 percent year-on-year, while those to the Asia-Pacific market remained flat. Shipments to Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 5.3 percent, reflecting stronger-than-usual seasonal demand.

Global PC shipments in the second half are likely to remain flat, as vendors have front-loaded inventory to meet demand, potentially leading to excess stock by the end of this year, Gartner research principal Rishi Padhi said in a statement.

Full-year shipments are expected to grow 2.4 percent this year from last year, driven by front-loaded inventory in the US in the first half and replacement demand stemming from the Windows 11 upgrade cycle, Gartner said.

Asustek in May said it began stockpiling PC and notebook inventory equivalent to three to six months of supply in the fourth quarter of last year.

Acer earlier this month said it had not front-loaded inventory for the US market in response to potential high US tariffs, with its inventory levels remaining normal at six to eight weeks.

Last week, International Data Corp (IDC) reported a slowdown in US PC demand in the second quarter due to tariff-related uncertainty, adding that PC vendors’ US sales could slow this quarter amid inventory buildup.

“Price increases will likely be dispersed over time and geography depending on vendor strategy, which can potentially lead to some attractive promotions as a way to clear inventory backups,” IDC worldwide device tracker group vice president Ryan Reith said in a statement.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/07/16/P09-250716-323.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 14:20:42.288422

US tariff policies could reshape the global printing industry, with potential impacts reaching into the tens of billions of dollars. Depending on the scenario, US printing consumption in 2030 could range from $78.6 billion to $84.7 billion, a swing of more than $6 billion driven by tariff-related uncertainty.

Key findings include:

• Segments like commercial print and book printing face the steepest declines due to discretionary spending cuts and import reliance.

• Despite pressures, packaging-related print is forecast to grow steadily, driven by e-commerce and food sectors.

• Prices for US-manufactured paper and inks will be affected by imported raw materials, and there is not enough US capacity for printing papers, inks and plates in the short term.

• Export of used sheetfed offset hardware will be impacted as much of this is destined for India and China, where tariffs remain high.

• Printers and suppliers could be forced to explore reshoring and regional hubs to mitigate future tariff risks.",https://www.inkworldmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/07/ink-favicon.png,N,,2025-07-15 17:08:44.928984

Stellantis is stepping away from Symbio, the hydrogen mobility joint venture it formed with Michelin and Forvia, leaving its partners to rethink their hydrogen ambitions.

What does this mean?

Stellantis – a global auto giant – is dropping its one-third stake in Symbio, signaling it’ll steer away from hydrogen investments after 2026. That’s a big blow for Symbio, with Forvia and Michelin now carrying the baton alone. Michelin called the move “unexpected” and warned of real risks to jobs in France and beyond, while Forvia weighed the broader operational impact. The episode highlights just how hard it’s been for hydrogen vehicles to go mainstream: Symbio could be left scrambling for fresh funding and a new strategy. All told, this retreat shines a light on the uphill battle hydrogen tech still faces while other sectors, like electric vehicles, keep gaining momentum.

Why should I care?

For markets: Hydrogen hype gets harder to sell.

Stellantis’s exit is likely to stir more skepticism among investors and industry insiders who were betting on hydrogen in the auto space. As one of the leading names in mobility steps back, cash and confidence could shift to electric vehicles and established clean tech. That means suppliers and hydrogen startups might need to tighten their belts, and some projects could hit the brakes as uncertainty lingers.

A spokesperson for Mr Yeo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Long-time City Developments Limited director Philip Yeo is leaving the Singapore property giant’s board, after a recent feud rocked the billionaire Kwek clan that controls it and caused a rift in its boardroom.

Mr Yeo, a former top civil servant who has been on CDL’s board for 16 years, has given notice of his retirement and his last day will be July 31, according to a stock exchange filing on July 15 .

The 78-year-old’s departure as a non-independent and non-executive director comes after a tumultuous few months for Singapore’s wealthiest family.

In February 2025, CDL’s octogenarian chairman Kwek Leng Beng accused his son and chief executive officer Sherman Kwek of

orchestrating a boardroom coup at the developer

but tensions remained on the board

.

During the company’s annual general meeting in April, Mr Yeo lashed out at several CDL directors, saying he was “very disappointed” with how some of the board members had pushed through new director appointments earlier in the year, and calling the moves “totally improper”.

Despite Mr Yeo’s comments, all five of CDL’s independent directors who were up for re-election were reappointed by an overwhelming majority of shareholders at the meeting.

CDL’s filing on July 15 said that there were no unresolved differences in opinion on material matters between Mr Yeo and the rest of the board.

A spokesperson for Mr Yeo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Following his departure, the developer’s board will have 10 directors.

The exact nature of any potential M&A deal and the timing of the discussions are not known.
Accenture, a U.S.-listed consulting giant, has been expanding in agency services through its Accenture Song division; it is valued at $175 billion (£130 billion).
David Droga, the global CEO of Accenture Song, is also planning to step down and become vice chair of Accenture, and Ndidi Oteh, Americas lead for Accenture Song, will succeed him in September, the company announced on May 28.
Accenture Song has “no interest” in what he described as “the old media game,"" he said at a press briefing.","LONDON: Accenture and WPP have had discussions about a potential M&A deal or partnership, multiple sources have told Campaign.

It is thought at least one senior representative from each company has taken part in talks.

Campaign Germany and Campaign UK first heard about high-level contact between Accenture and WPP at the start of May. (Campaign is PRWeek's sister business media brand at Haymarket Media).

The exact nature of any potential M&A deal and the timing of the discussions are not known.

Multiple sources have suggested that Julie Sweet, chair and chief executive of Accenture, was involved in one meeting.

Accenture said it had no comment, and WPP also said it had no comment when Campaign asked each of the companies whether a senior representative from Accenture has met a senior representative from WPP since the start of 2025 to discuss a potential deal or partnership involving the two companies.

One industry source played down the significance of any contact.

“Companies talk to each other all the time about hypothetical tie-ups, and most of these conversations are fleeting one-offs that never amount to anything,” this person said. Another industry source suggested the M&A conversations have not progressed.

Accenture, a U.S.-listed consulting giant, has been expanding in agency services through its Accenture Song division; it is valued at $175 billion (£130 billion). It could afford to acquire some or all of U.K.-based WPP, one of the world’s largest agency groups, which is worth about £4.5 billion ($6.1 billion).

Both companies are in the middle of leadership changes. WPP last week named Cindy Rose, a Microsoft executive and existing WPP non-executive director, as its new CEO, taking over in September from Mark Read, whose departure was announced on June 9.

David Droga, the global CEO of Accenture Song, is also planning to step down and become vice chair of Accenture, and Ndidi Oteh, Americas lead for Accenture Song, will succeed him in September, the company announced on May 28.

Media-buying is a key battleground

Brian Wieser, a long-time industry analyst and founder of Madison & Wall, a research firm, told Campaign it “absolutely made sense” if Accenture and WPP wanted to “explore” a potential deal or transaction.

Wieser, who worked at WPP from 2019 until 2023, said Accenture Song lacks scale in media-buying, which has become increasingly important in agency services, and WPP owns WPP Media, the world’s biggest media-buying group, formerly known as Group M.

Accenture has always maintained it does not need to be involved in traditional media planning and buying, but Sweet told investors in March that it was ramping up its media operation.

Meanwhile, WPP faces being overtaken in global media billings by Omnicom Group, which is due to complete the takeover of Interpublic Group later this year, and it has also been losing business, notably to Publicis Groupe.

WPP has warned of worsening revenues, most recently on July 9, when it issued a shock profit warning, and its share price has halved since January.

“WPP has been a takeover target for a while,” Wieser said. “A break-up has always been an option [too],” he added, if that appealed to an acquirer and delivered value for WPP’s own shareholders.

“There was always industrial logic for Accenture to have the capabilities that WPP has. But it also made sense that Accenture didn’t need all of those capabilities — nobody, not even WPP, needs three global creative networks,” Wieser said.

Droga recently criticized what he called the “broken” business models of holding companies at Cannes Lions in June. Accenture Song has “no interest” in what he described as “the old media game,"" he said at a press briefing. “That model is going to break. And if we can’t help or be one of the architects that creates a new model, then the platforms will do it without us.”

Wieser said Accenture’s longstanding insistence that it did not want to get involved in media was sincere but he went on, “It’s hard to imagine they didn’t have some doubts around their strategy which avoided owning a traditional media agency. Media has been the most durable and fast-growing and resilient part of the [agency] business and it’s adapted to AI already. When you look at Accenture today, you can see holes and one of those holes is a media agency.”

Separately, analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove published a note last week about Cindy Rose’s “strategic options” in which they said WPP’s “earlier-than-expected” appointment of a CEO “potentially makes WPP less vulnerable to a bid.""

A sale of assets is hypothetically an option, and WPP Media “could be of particular interest to consultancies,"" but “WPP is unlikely to sell it, as it is key to its integrated offering,"" the investment bank said.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/ORP/accenturewpplogos-cuk.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 14:21:27.386252

At its annual general meeting, the fashion giant reaffirmed its international ambitions with a $1.8 billion investment plan and continued expansion in key markets. “We will continue our project-by-project approach,” said CEO Óscar García Maceiras.

Inditex’s headquarters in Sabón (Arteixo, A Coruña) hosted the group’s general shareholders’ meeting on Tuesday, with 4,558 people present or represented by proxies, accounting for 89.42% of the company’s share capital.

Chairperson Marta Ortega described the event as “always a very special moment,” especially as it marked 50 years of ’s evolution—years of “tireless work, shared challenges, moments overcome,” and “above all, people.”

According to Ortega, customer focus has always driven the group’s strategy: “Listening to them and surprising them with design, quality and closeness” remains central to Inditex’s success.

Ortega noted that growth is expected to continue “not only in size, but also in responsibility, relevance, and values,” even in “complex times full of challenges.” The company is currently present in 97 countries, operates online in 214 territories, and employs talent from over 170 nationalities.

“We know where we started, but never how far we can go,” she said, crediting the company’s workforce as its greatest strength.

Ortega also thanked José Arnau, vice chairman since 2012 and representative of Pontegadea—the investment firm founded by Amancio Ortega—who will retire in October. Roberto Cibeira, CEO of Pontegadea, will succeed him on the board of directors.

Tariff strategy and U.S. expansion

In response to questions about potential U.S. tariffs, García Maceiras emphasized Inditex’s diversified business model and global production across 50 countries. “We are maintaining our strategy in the United States,” he said, noting the group’s project-by-project approach since its 1989 U.S. entry.

He cited recent openings in Los Angeles, a second store in Boston, and the relocation of a Manhattan location. Plans are also underway for new stores in Las Vegas and North Carolina, the first Zara store in Los Angeles, and a future flagship in San Francisco.

New executive incentive plan approved

All agenda items were approved during the meeting, including a new long-term incentive plan for management. Up to 750 employees, including executive directors, will benefit from a €4.5 million program—equivalent to 0.14% of the company’s share capital—featuring a maximum of 105,556 shares allocated to García Maceiras.

The plan, aligned with the company’s 2024–2026 remuneration policy, combines a multi-year cash bonus and stock awards, contingent on achieving objectives over two cycles: February 1, 2025, to January 31, 2028, and February 1, 2026, to January 31, 2029.

Dive Insight:

Albertsons has been directing resources toward its pharmacy and e-commerce operations, and those investments are paying off for the company, executives said during the earnings call.

The grocer has seen “sequential improvement” in its core grocery operations and believes that continued strength in that area will help push identical sales up as the year moves ahead, McCollam said. The company now expects identical sales to rise between 2% and 2.75% during fiscal 2025, up from the range of 1.5% to 2.5% it previously forecast.

Albertsons’ pharmacy and health business grew 20% year over year during Q1, due in part to robust prescription sales and immunization growth, said CEO Susan Morris, who took over the top job in May. That, in turn, is helping to increase sales elsewhere in the store.

People who make purchases at the pharmacy counter visit stores four times more often and buy significantly more groceries than other shoppers, Morris said, underscoring the long-term value for Albertsons of investing in that part of its business.

Morris added that Albertsons has found that GLP-1 drugs intended to help people lose weight have turned into sales drivers beyond the pharmacy counter despite the fact that the grocer does not make much money on the drugs themselves.

While shoppers who take those medications often decrease the size of their basket at the start, they typically start buying things like supplements and lean proteins, “categories that are actually quite profitable for us as a company,” Morris said.

During Q1, Albertsons saw 25% growth in digital sales, and e-commerce accounted for 9% of total grocery revenue, Morris said.

In response to a question from an analyst, McCollam said Albertsons is “getting very close” to breaking even on its e-commerce operations — a goal that Walmart has already achieved and Kroger is also pursuing.

McCollam emphasized that Albertsons does not take its Albertsons Media Collective digital media operation into account when evaluating the profitability of its e-commerce business, which she said differentiates it from competitors.

“From a financial point of view, of course, [e-commerce] creates data for the media collective, and it is a major provider of information for the media collective. But from a P&L point of view, it’s pure. What is driving that is volume, first and foremost,” McCollam said.

Morris also said during the call that Albertsons sees a strong growth path for its own brand business, noting that while private label penetration was nearly 26% during Q1, the company believes that figure should be at least 30%.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_px6lW8f4e2oL9yyMmfrUEQp2sMQRynwArVtTpnZimA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TYWZld2F5X0NoZWhhbGlzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-15 14:19:39.836511

Albertsons's new CEO, Susan Morris, says the company is starting to see increases in cost of goods 'moving ahead'

Grocery chain Albertsons Cos. reported fiscal first-quarter results early Tuesday, with the grocery chain explaining why tariff-related inflation has not yet hit its customers. But it acknowledged that at some point, some costs could be passed on to consumers.

During the conference call to discuss the results, Albertsons (ACI) Chief Executive Susan Morris was asked about the impact of tariff-related inflation on ingredients and packaging in its grocery and pharmacy businesses.

""We're starting to see increases in cost of goods moving ahead,"" she added. ""And we've got a very rigorous process of first and foremost, quite frankly, just pushing back.""

Morris said the company has so far worked hard to avoid passing to the consumer the inflation seen from higher costs of goods, which has effectively weighed on profitability and is hurting the stock.

The CEO added that Albertsons is looking for alternate sources of supply or other products that it can push if the tariffs become unwieldy. ""And then finally, in certain cases, if we have to, will pass them on to customers,"" she added.

The company could also expand its Own Brands products in response to tariffs, according to Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam. ""So as we look forward and we look at the tariffs, it may be that there comes a point where we decide that an expansion in our assortment in Own Brands is a great solution for our customer,"" she said.

Morris, who took over as Albertsons CEO on May 1, also reiterated her comment last quarter that the overwhelming majority of the goods sourced by the company are domestically based. This number stands at ""well over 90%,"" she said during Tuesday's conference call.

Tariff-related inflation looks set to be a key theme of this retail earnings season. Last week, Helen of Troy Ltd. (HELE) said that inflationary impacts from higher tariffs have not yet been fully realized by the consumer, which could create further pressure on its results in the second half of the year.

Also last week, Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG) said that consumer sentiment weakened during its recent fiscal fourth quarter. The branded-foods company cited prolonged inflation and economic pressures that weighed on purchasing behaviors.

On Tuesday, the government said that the consumer-price index rose 0.3% in June, marking the biggest rise since January. The CPI data matched Wall Street's forecast, although there were only scattered signs of inflation related to President Donald Trump's sweeping wave of tariffs.

Shares of Albertsons were down 5.3% in midday trading, as the grocery chain beat Wall Street's first-quarter adjusted earnings and sales estimates, and raised its full-year same-store sales outlook, but saw profitability decline.

Albertson's gross margin rate, which is a measure of what the company makes on its sales, decreased to 27.1% during the quarter, the lowest rate seen since the company went public again in June 2020, from 27.8% in the same period last year.

The company said the gross margin decrease was driven primarily by ""incremental investments in our customer value proposition,"" which is another way of saying it paid to keep prices down. The company also saw strong growth in pharmacy sales, which carry an overall lower gross margin rate, and increases in delivery and handling costs related to digital sales growth.

The company's net income was $236 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $247 million, or 41 cents a share, in the prior year's quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, earnings were 55 cents a share, above the FactSet consensus estimate of 54 cents a share.

Sales rose to $24.88 billion from $24.27 billion in the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for sales of $24.71 billion. Albertsons' first quarter ended on June 14.

Same-store sales rose 2.8% boosted by strong growth in pharmacy sales, and came in above the FactSet consensus estimate of a 2.1% rise.

E-commerce grew 25% in the quarter and reached 9% of total grocery revenue. Albertsons' loyalty members grew 14% to 47.3 million.

The Boise, Idaho-based company raised its fiscal 2025 same-store sales outlook to between 2% and 2.75%, from its prior outlook between 1.5% and 2.5%. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were looking for full-year same-store sales growth of 2%. Albertsons maintained its adjusted net income forecast of $2.03 to $2.16 a share and its outlook for capital expenditures in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.

""ACI reported a solid start to F1Q26 with stronger-than-forecast [identical sales] supported by strong pharmacy & digital sales,"" wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Kelly Bania, in a note released Tuesday. ""The full-year F2026 profit outlook was unchanged despite a slightly higher outlook for [identical sales]."" BMO Capital Markets has an outperform rating for Albertsons.

Albertsons shares were up 6.7% in 2025, compared with the S&P 500 index's SPX gain of 6.5%.

Closure of the two long steel plants in Vereeniging and Newcastle will result in the loss of at least 3 500 permanent and contractor jobs in two economically depressed regions of South Africa’s industrial and steel heartlands.
In reaction, the Golden Triangle Chamber of Commerce (GTCoC) said any close-down would be the direct result of the Government of National Unity (GNU) failing to address policy and structural issues confronting the domestic steel industry.

Currently, a 6-month closure deferral process is in place until September 30. However, the Company may need to make preparations for shuttering and closure beyond this date.

This was despite ArcelorMittal SA receiving a R1.6 billion funding facility from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) to keep its long steel operations going whilst Government was supposed to address logistical, input costs such as electricity and other impediments to the steel industry from a structural perspective.

“Transnet’s rail performance deteriorated to its lowest levels ever resulting in significantly elevated operating risk and unaffordable additional cost being borne by the Company,” says ArcelorMittal SA.

The change, part of a wider turnaround strategy, increases the previous three-day in-office requirement.

In the same announcement, Starbucks confirmed that all corporate “people leaders” must relocate to either Seattle or Toronto within the next 12 months. Employees who decline the relocation offer will be eligible for a voluntary exit package, including a cash payout.

CEO Brian Niccol shared his rationale for the move, saying: “We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster.”

Major employers renew in-office focus

Starbucks’ shift aligns with a broader trend among major employers pulling back on pandemic-era flexibility.

Amazon announced in late 2024 that employees would be expected in the office five days a week beginning in the new year. The company linked the decision to gains in collaboration and company culture.

Apple has required in-person attendance at least three days a week since 2022, with CEO Tim Cook supporting the move to strengthen teamwork.

Walmart’s 2024 policy required remote employees to relocate to major hubs such as its Arkansas headquarters. Though hybrid models remain, the retailer has pushed for most work to take place on-site.

Dell followed suit in January 2025, eliminating remote work for employees living near company offices, mandating a full five-day in-office schedule.

Disney’s mandate came earlier, with CEO Bob Iger in January 2023 requiring hybrid workers to return four days per week starting in March of that year.

Wall Street follows suit as RTO accelerates

The finance sector has also leaned into in-person operations. JPMorgan Chase mandated five-day in-office work for managing directors in 2023 and is reportedly weighing an expansion of that policy.

Goldman Sachs has supported a full return since 2022, while Citigroup asked its US-based remote workers to return to office full-time in 2025, albeit with some hybrid flexibility.

Although companies like Airbnb and Spotify continue to embrace flexible working models, most large employers are shifting away from remote setups.

Research from Capital Economics found office attendance based on keycard swipes reached just 50% nationally by mid-2025. The firm also reported Seattle and San Francisco are the only major US cities projected to see office rents fall through 2029.

The corporate push towards a full return is at odds with the attitudes of workers who regard flexible working as one of the more sought after benefits, some even ahead of salary. Recent research by CultureX and Work Forward’s Flex Index showed that strict five-day office firms received lower employee marks for supportiveness, leadership quality, toxicity, candor, and work-life balance.

Niccol acknowledged the mixed reactions, saying: “We understand not everyone will agree with this approach. We’ve listened and thought carefully. But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”",https://www.executivegrapevine.com/uploads/articles/social-starbucks-ceo-issues-rto-ultimatum.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 20:09:29.799461

Its investment in Kraft Heinz common shares also pulled in more than $6 billion in dividends.
Buffett’s company has pulled back from Kraft Heinz in recent years.
Kraft Heinz shares were up nearly 5% since Thursday’s close before news of the breakup hit.","Warren Buffett touted the chance to bring “iconic brands together” in 2015 when he backed the creation of Kraft Heinz Co. The plans to split up many of those brands a decade later represent a rare flop for the famed investor.

Kraft Heinz shares are down more than 60% — while the broader stock market soared — since Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital to merge the two consumer companies. Berkshire’s roughly 27% stake in the company is worth about $4.5 billion less than where it’s marked on its books, and getting out now would bring even more pain.

The deal marks an uncommon whiff for Buffett, 94, who’s due to step down as Berkshire’s chief executive officer at year-end, capping a six-decade run during which he made huge sums on many household names. While steady dividends and gains on the acquisition of Heinz two years before its merger with Kraft has left Berkshire firmly in the black overall, the conglomerate would have pulled in nearly $10 billion more on its common-shares investment by betting on the broader stock market.

“Perhaps what he didn’t foresee was this move toward healthier options,” said Matthew Palazola, a senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Kraft Heinz is really big on processed foods, and Buffett was pretty well known for not having the best diet himself and was perhaps not looking ahead.”

A representative for Berkshire Hathaway didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Kraft Heinz has a stable of household names like Oscar Mayer and Kraft Mac & Cheese, but it’s been hurt by inflation and a shift away from packaged foods, driven in part by weight-loss drugs. The company is now exploring a move to break up and spin off a large part of its business into a new entity, Bloomberg News has previously reported.

Buffett has acknowledged that Kraft wasn’t the best bet. In 2019, when Kraft Heinz wrote down some of its best-known brands by $15.4 billion, the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said his firm overpaid for Kraft.

Berkshire managed to make money by gaining billions from the dividends on its preferred stock in Heinz and the redemption of those shares in 2016. Its investment in Kraft Heinz common shares also pulled in more than $6 billion in dividends.

Buffett’s company has pulled back from Kraft Heinz in recent years. Earlier this year, Kraft Heinz said that two of its board members associated with Berkshire were stepping down, noting that it wasn’t as a result of any disagreement with management or the board over the firm’s operations, policies or practices.

For now, Berkshire still holds a massive stake in the company. If the split helps juice returns at the food company, Buffett stands to gain even more. Kraft Heinz shares were up nearly 5% since Thursday’s close before news of the breakup hit.

“The split will enhance the investment,” said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. “Because, quite frankly, it hasn’t been the most positive investment.”",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/436278317%20%281%29.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 16:13:11.886393

Flexibility at Starbucks Niccol claimed that flexibility is still part of the equation at the company.","Starbucks is making a big push to bring its office workers back together, and the message from the top is clear: more face time is the new normal.

In a recent update, CEO Brian Niccol outlined a shift in company policy that will see support partners and people managers spending at least four days a week in the office, up from the previous three.

“Common days will be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday; this applies to our Seattle and Toronto Support Centers as well as North America regional offices,” he wrote.

For those who feel the new in-office culture isn’t a fit, Starbucks is offering a voluntary exit program with a cash payout, said Niccol.

“If you decide you want to leave Starbucks for any reason, we respect that. To support those who decide to ‘opt out,’ we’re offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.”

Starbucks looking to ‘turn business around’

The new policy kicks in with the start of the new fiscal year, and Starbucks says it will provide more details before October, including plans for dedicated desks for everyone.

The move isn’t just about showing up—it’s about building a culture, said the CEO.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster.

“Being in-person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

Back in April, Starbucks reported weaker-than-expected earnings and another quarter of same-store sales declines, said CNBC, but the coffee giant said its turnaround strategy was showing early signs of success.

“Our financial results don’t yet reflect our progress, but we have real momentum with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan,” Niccol said in a video posted on the company’s website. “We’re testing and learning at speed and we’re seeing changes in our coffeehouses.”

Some of those tweaks include scaling back plans to automate more coffee-making and investing more in labour, which weighed on earnings during the quarter, said CNBC.

Relocations to Seattle, Toronto

For those in leadership roles, the company is raising the bar even higher. All support centre people leaders are now expected to relocate to Seattle or Toronto within a year, said the CEO in his recent post.

“We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams. In February, we asked all vp+ leaders working remotely to begin relocating to Seattle or Toronto. We are now extending this requirement to all Support Center people leaders who will be expected to be based in Seattle or Toronto within 12 months,” the update reads.

Individual contributors aren’t being asked to move, but future hires and lateral moves will be limited to those willing to work from Seattle or Toronto. The company will still allow “in-market roles” for jobs that need to be in a specific location, but those will be the exception.

Flexibility at Starbucks

Niccol claimed that flexibility is still part of the equation at the company.

“We… know you sometimes need to step out or leave early to attend an event at your kid’s school, see the doctor, or handle other personal matters. That’s expected and completely okay. But the default for support partners should be working in-person, in a Starbucks office, alongside your team and cross-functional partners.”

He acknowledged that not everyone will be thrilled with the new direction.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach. We’ve listened and thought carefully. But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

When Starbucks recently introduced a new dress code for employees at more than 120 U.S. stores, it triggered a coordinated strike by more than 2,000 baristas, and the issue quickly became a flashpoint in a much broader labour dispute that had already been simmering for over a year.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/ca/126/0370_638881907115326127.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 18:09:38.203064

UNITAR Teams With HP To Boost Youth, Women Digital Equity

UNITAR and HP Inc. signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly implement an initiative focused on digital inclusion, youth employability, and women's empowerment through technology and innovation.

The collaboration will centre on leveraging HP's award-winning Gaming Garage and UNITAR's learning and capacity-building expertise to co-develop cutting-edge digital education programmes.

Pilot projects under the partnership are expected to launch in late 2025, beginning in select countries with plans for regional and global scale-up.

14 July 2025, Geneva, Switzerland - The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and HP Inc. (HP) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly implement an initiative focused on digital inclusion, youth employability, and women's empowerment through technology and innovation.

The collaboration was formalised during a signing ceremony at UNITAR Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, with the Director of the Division for Prosperity, Ms. Mihoko Kumamoto and HP's Global Education team. The strategic relationship signals a shared commitment to building inclusive, future-oriented learning ecosystems that prepare underserved communities for the digital economy.

The collaboration will centre on leveraging HP's award-winning Gaming Garage, recognised as Best CSR Programme at GESS Dubai 2024, and UNITAR's learning and capacity-building expertise to co-develop cutting-edge digital education programmes. These initiatives aim to empower youth and women with high-impact training in game development, entrepreneurship, and emerging technologies such as generative AI.

Empowering Innovation Through Gamified Learning

At the core of the initiative is a focus on gamified, experiential learning, combining the creative potential of the gaming industry with job-ready digital skills. The effort will introduce new training content, such as the course ""Generative AI Mastery: Revolutionising Game Development"", offering learners the opportunity to explore AI-powered storytelling, design, and innovation.

The programme will also support the creation of digital hubs and innovation labs in underserved regions, in partnership with local stakeholders including governments, the private sector, and civil society. These spaces will serve as centres of learning, creativity, and livelihood development, particularly in Africa and other emerging regions.

Strategic Alignment with Global Goals

The partnership aligns with UNITAR's mission to leave no one behind in the digital transformation and HP's commitment to accelerating digital equity for 150 million people by 2030. It also contributes directly to the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in the areas of quality education, gender equality, decent work, and innovation.

This collaboration reflects UNITAR's commitment to ensuring no one is left behind in the digital transformation. By combining HP's innovation with our inclusive learning expertise, we are creating real pathways for youth and women to participate in the global digital economy."" - Mihoko Kumamoto, Director, Division for Prosperity, UNITAR.

HP is committed to leveraging technology to ignite positive change and empower future generations. Together with UNITAR, we are providing young people across various regions with invaluable skills in design, programming, AI, and blockchain to equip them for success in the dynamic fields of technology and game development and inspire them to become the innovators and leaders of tomorrow. The initiative underscores the transformative role of skills in the modern economy and our commitment to fostering a brighter future."" - Mayank Dhingra, Global Director, Education Strategy, HP Inc.

Looking Ahead

Pilot projects under the partnership are expected to launch in late 2025, beginning in select countries with plans for regional and global scale-up. UNITAR and HP will jointly monitor impact, document lessons learned and explore opportunities for expansion in line with evolving industry demands and community needs.

This partnership also supports the objectives of the UN AI for Good Global Summit, where UNITAR and HP are contributing to the global dialogue on AI, education, and inclusive digital transformation.

Amazon plans to offer an affordable satellite service by redesigning the satellite itself to lower the costs of deployment.
The answer is very simple,” Rajeev Badyal, head of Project Kuiper, said in a video on Project Kuiper’s website.
AWS for the Internet of Things: Amazon may bundle LEO satellite service with its cloud services to help manage a customer’s Internet of Things and related data.
Amazon logistics: Amazon will be able to better manage its own logistics assets with an always-on, connected network.","Amazon’s Project Kuiper launched low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites into space for the first time in April and June, with the goal of serving consumers, businesses and governments that have trouble getting coverage.

About 2.6 billion people do not have fast broadband internet access, and assuming Amazon grabs a 30% share of the consumer market, the company could generate $7.1 billion by 2032, according to BofA Global Research analysts in a July report shared with PYMNTS.

“Kuiper is a big investment initiative for Amazon that has endured despite ongoing cost-cutting,” wrote BofA analyst Justin Post in the report.

Amazon is planning to offer three tiers of broadband service:

Ultra-compact satellite antenna that manages speeds of up to 100 megabits per second

Standard antenna with speeds of up to 400 megabits per second

Largest model with speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second

“We see a compelling opportunity, and potentially strong long-term margins given high startup costs,” Post wrote, adding that he is projecting Amazon to spend $23 billion building out its satellite service, excluding consumer equipment costs.

The market potential for Amazon exists even if SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service already has 6 million subscribers, Post wrote.

Amazon plans to offer an affordable satellite service by redesigning the satellite itself to lower the costs of deployment.

“Why aren’t rural areas connected? The answer is very simple,” Rajeev Badyal, head of Project Kuiper, said in a video on Project Kuiper’s website. “If it were cost-effective, it would have been done by now. But it isn’t.”

Deploying wired broadband — what most households in cities enjoy through cable lines buried in the ground — is more expensive in large, sparsely populated areas because it requires more physical materials like poles and cables to connect one house. In cities, the cost is spread out because it can connect more homes.

Amazon’s satellite ambitions echo earlier efforts by Google to provide global internet access. Google’s Project Loon, which used stratospheric balloons to beam broadband, was discontinued in 2021 due to difficulty in getting costs low enough to offer a feasible business model.

Synergies With Amazon’s Other Businesses

Satellite broadband tends to be more expensive, slower and less reliable than wired or mobile broadband. But for many, it is the only option.

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission said in a report last year that 45 million people cannot get broadband at 100 megabits per second download speeds for fixed and 35 megabits per second 5G for mobile service. According to internet testing company Ookla, the median wired download speed in the U.S. is 289 megabits per second.

Post said Starlink keeps its costs down by using SpaceX, its parent company, to launch into space. The company has nearly 8,000 LEO satellites in space with plans to launch around 42,000 in the future. Like Amazon, Starlink uses low-orbit satellites — those deployed up to 2,000 kilometers above the Earth’s surface.

The FCC approved 3,200 satellites for Amazon to launch and run, Post said. Amazon launches its satellites using rockets from several companies, including its own Blue Origin, SpaceX and United Launch Alliance. To keep costs down since it cannot always use its own rockets to launch, the Amazon team has redesigned its satellites.

Even though satellite broadband has been around for two decades, Post said, low-orbit satellite technology is one that was developed only in recent years. The older satellite systems — geostationary Earth orbit or GEO — are placed about 36,000 kilometers above the planet and typically offer slower speeds. Providers include Hughesnet and Viasat.

Post said he sees Amazon’s Project Kuiper as synergistic as well, enhancing its other businesses in the future.

Data transfer for AWS clients: Project Kuiper will be able to offer clients private connectivity into AWS without routing data through public internet. In the future, customers will be able to move private data to their own data centers or other public clouds as well.

AWS for the Internet of Things: Amazon may bundle LEO satellite service with its cloud services to help manage a customer’s Internet of Things and related data. For example, a logistics company could better manage, direct and optimize their delivery assets — which could increasingly become automated — in real time using a satellite network.

Amazon logistics: Amazon will be able to better manage its own logistics assets with an always-on, connected network. While mobile networks cover most of the U.S., a satellite network could offer better connectivity for on-ground and airborne assets. Amazon could connect to its future robots or drones through Project Kuiper.

Albertsons’ 14% growth in loyalty membership last quarter signals just how eager consumers are for savings.
With more people eating at home to stretch their dollars, Albertsons’ value-focused approach helped it outperform expectations and could drive strength in coming quarters.","The situation: Strong performances in ecommerce and pharmacy helped Albertsons beat top- and bottom-line expectations despite continued pressure across the grocery industry.

Albertsons is also winning over more shoppers by making its loyalty program more rewarding and easier to use. Membership rose 14% in the quarter thanks to more deals, simpler ways to earn points, and bigger cash-back perks.

The numbers:

Revenues were $24.88 billion in the fiscal first quarter ended June 14, up 2.5% YoY, and ahead of the $24.71 billion that analysts expected.

Same-store sales grew 2.8%, well ahead of the 2.1% analysts had forecast.

Digital sales jumped 25%.

Earnings per share were 55 cents, down 16.7% YoY, but slightly ahead of the 54 cents forecast.

The grocer raised its full-year 2025 comparable sales outlook to a range of 2% to 2.75% growth, up from its previous guidance of 1.5% to 2.5%. However, it held firm on its profit forecast, as much of the fiscal Q1 upside came from lower-margin pharmacy sales and higher-cost digital orders.

Our take: Consumers remain laser-focused on value, especially at the grocery store. While food inflation has eased since the sharp spikes of 2021 to 2023, the impact of those increases—plus the threat of new tariff-driven price hikes—has shoppers watching their grocery bills closely.

Albertsons’ 14% growth in loyalty membership last quarter signals just how eager consumers are for savings.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Susan Morris: Thanks, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, our teams delivered solid results with ID sales growth of 2.8%, adjusted EBITDA of $1.11 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.55. These results again demonstrate gradual and incremental progress against our five strategic priorities, which include driving customer growth and engagement through digital connection, growing our media collective, enhancing the customer value proposition, modernizing capabilities through technology, and driving transformational productivity. Within these priorities, our four digital platforms continue to be the catalyst for customer growth and engagement. We continue to drive increased sales, all while generating data and insights for the media collective.

Our first digital platform is e-commerce, which grew 25% and reached 9% of total grocery revenue in the first quarter. This growth was again led by strong performance in our first-party business, driven by award-winning capabilities and our fully integrated mobile app, and supported by our five-star certification program. Our focus on delivering exceptional customer service experience is fueling new customer acquisition and strengthening existing customer retention. To do this, we are continuing to enhance our digital shopping experience, including the introduction of AI and interactive features that deliver both ease and convenience.

For example, we launched our new shop assist feature, which enables a connected shopping experience that allows customers to communicate back and forth with our in-store associates throughout their order's fulfillment process. We've also created more flexibility in our basket building. Customers can now add items to their orders up until picking has started, recognizing that shoppers often think of one more item they need just after an order is placed. While our e-commerce penetration is still below industry peers, it is one of our biggest growth, customer acquisition, and customer retention opportunities for 2025 and beyond. From a profitability perspective, our e-commerce business is near breakeven and improving.

Our second digital platform is loyalty, which grew 14% to 47 million members in the first quarter as we capitalized on the simplification of our program and further enhanced the value the program offers. Members in the program today are engaging more frequently, using more of our easy-to-understand and redeem features, and spending more with us. As a case in point, 30% of our engaged households are now electing the cash-off option, reinforcing the customer's desire for immediate value. As we did last quarter, loyalty is a key enabler of digital engagement and a rich source of data for our media collectives.

Throughout 2025, we will continue to introduce compelling benefits that will attract new members, improve share of wallet, and further enable marketing and monetization opportunities for the media collective. We will also continue to simplify and expand the program to include strategic partnerships to offer even more value. Our third digital platform is pharmacy and health, which grew 20% year over year, driven by industry-leading script and immunization growth, best-in-class customer satisfaction scores, and the ongoing integration of pharmacy and Sincerely Health into our overall digital experience. Cross shoppers between grocery and pharmacy are exceptionally valuable.

Over time, these customers visit the store four times more often and buy significantly more groceries with us, resulting in outsized customer lifetime value across the entire store. For this reason, in addition to the market share opportunity competitor closings are creating for us, we're also continuing to invest in our pharmacy and health digital platform. Through this platform, we're also launching customized omnichannel benefits that are not only attracting new customers but also converting existing pharmacy and grocery-only customers to become cross shoppers. It is also helping customers to find new and personalized ways to improve their health and well-being, consistent with evolving national trends.

Our pharmacy and health plus platform is an integral part of our customers for life strategy and a significant growth and customer engagement opportunity. For this reason, leveraging our growing scale to improve pharmacy profitability over time is a key operational priority. To deliver this, we are continuing to pursue higher-margin service offerings and drive productivity through improved sourcing, increased automation, and labor optimization. This quarter, we opened our third central fill processing facility, which is reducing our cost of serve while at the same time improving overall customer experience. The fourth digital platform is the integration of the mobile app for use in our stores. We're not just selling food.

We're simplifying meal planning and making shopping easier and more convenient both in-store and online. Our app has become the epicenter of the omnichannel experience, with digital customers engaging nearly three times a week on average. What began as a tool for enabling e-commerce and delivering great deals is now a Swiss army knife of tools that makes customers' lives easier, regardless of whether they're shopping in our stores or online. These tools include best-in-class list building, personalized meal planning capabilities, powerful search and product locating capability, and an in-store mode that connects meal planning and other store-specific capabilities.

In our media collective in the first quarter, we significantly increased the high-impact digital inventory as our digital platforms work together to enrich our data and generate deeper customer engagement to accelerate growth and deliver superior return on ad spend. We'll continue to invest in building industry-leading integrated solutions that will support both endemic and non-endemic partners. These solutions include refining shopper audiences, running targeting media campaigns with compressed measurement timelines, and delivering consistent omni execution to develop personalized relationships for our collective partners with our customers. These same solutions are also providing benefits for our internal loyalty and marketing initiatives.

As we look forward, we expect the collective to grow faster than the retail media market and ultimately be one of the largest sources of fuel for reinvestment into our core business over time. To improve our customer value proposition, we intentionally invested in value, both loyalty and promotional offerings, as well as by partnering with strategic vendors to invest in price in certain categories and certain markets. We also surgically manage through the pass-through of cost inflation to further invest in the customer's needs for immediate value. While it is early, these investments did deliver a sequential quarterly unit sales improvement and over time are expected to drive greater existing and new customer engagement across our banners.

We additionally amplified our own brand presence to drive further value for our customers. Own brand sales penetration finished the quarter at 25.7% as we launched new offerings across multiple categories. We also expanded the assortment in our recently introduced Overjoyed brand and launched our newest brand, Chef Counter, a chef-inspired meal solution targeting foodies seeking fast and easy restaurant-quality choices at affordable prices. These launches, coupled with greater prominence and better value in OMEN, were increased digital and omnichannel household engagement and higher transaction counts over time. Our next priority is the modernization of our capabilities through technology.

As we said last quarter, our North Star is to use technology in everything we do, and we are energized by the progress we are making toward this aspiration. Our technology-first focus is positioning us to make a greater impact faster, allowing us to drive greater innovation at a lower cost. Our advanced technology platform, on which we are continuing to innovate, powers our e-commerce, store, pharmacy, supply chain, merchandising, and media collective operation. And is allowing us to leverage emerging AI technologies to accelerate our operational transformation going forward. We are also using our advanced capabilities to use AI agents to enhance many business functions, including pricing and promotion, personalization, customer care, and cogeneration, among others.

Driving transformational productivity is our next priority, which is an imperative to fuel our growth. Our productivity engine continues to reduce costs, offset headwinds, and fund our growth priorities. It works hand in hand with our technology modernization, including our initiatives to leverage AI and data analytics, optimize supply chain costs through automation, build out shrink and labor management tools, to name a few. In addition, the largest of our opportunities continues to be the leveraging of our consolidated scale to buy goods for resale through national buying and more efficient supplier relations.

As we previously shared, from fiscal year 2025 through 2027, we expect our productivity engine to deliver $1.5 billion in savings, which we plan to reinvest in growth and our customer value proposition, as well as to offset other inflationary headwinds. Before I hand the call over to Sharon for an overview of our first quarter and to provide an update to our 2025 outlook, I'd like to give you an update on recent labor negotiations. In fiscal 2025, we have negotiations covering approximately 120,000 associates. As of today, we've reached agreements covering nearly half of these associates, with two pending rectifications in Colorado and Southern California.

We appreciate and value our associates, and in these contracts, we are meaningfully improving wages and benefits. At the same time, we're working to negotiate contracts that are not only financially responsible but also provide the operational flexibility the company needs to streamline operations, manage costs, and offer affordable prices in a rapidly changing grocery landscape. Sharon, over to you.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here with you today. As Susan shared, the investments we are making are delivering value to our customers and adding breadth to the capabilities we need to drive future growth. During the quarter, we saw early wins from these investments, affirming our confidence in our strategic priorities and our customers-per-life strategy. Included in these wins was identical sales growth this quarter of 2.8%, driven by 20% growth in pharmacy and a 25% increase in digital sales. We also saw a sequential improvement in core grocery units.

To drive this growth, our gross margin rate of 27.1% was lower than last year by 85 basis points, excluding fuel and legal expense. Incremental investments in our customer value proposition and the mix shift impact related to the strong growth in our pharmacy and digital businesses drove this decrease but was partially offset by benefits driven by our productivity initiatives, including improved shrink expense. Offsetting this gross margin investment was a 63 basis point improvement, excluding fuel, in our selling and administrative expense rates. This decrease was primarily driven by the leveraging of employee costs, reflecting the positive benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives and lower merger-related costs.

Interest expense in Q1 2025 decreased $4 million to $142 million compared to $146 million last year due to lower average borrowings. Income tax expense in the first quarter totaled $75 million or 24.1%, compared to $69 million or 22.3% in Q1 last year. This tax rate increase was primarily driven by a reduction of an uncertain tax position last year that did not recur in 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.111 billion in the first quarter compared to $1.14 billion last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $0.66 per diluted share last year. Now I'd like to discuss capital allocation, the balance sheet, and cash flow.

Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, during the first quarter, we invested $585 million in capital expenditures, including the opening of three new stores and the completion of 36 remodels, as well as the ongoing modernization of our digital and technology capabilities. We also returned $401 million to our shareholders, including $86 million in quarterly dividends and $315 million in share repurchases, leaving approximately $1.5 billion in our multiyear $2 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.96. Now, let me walk you through our updated 2025 outlook. As Susan said, we remained focused on our five strategic priorities.

Through the balance of fiscal 2025, we will continue to invest in our customer value proposition, customer experience, digital growth, media collective, and health and pharmacy. These investments are expected to drive outside growth in digital and pharmacy, both of which drive higher future customer lifetime value but create near-term margin headwinds. We will also continue to drive our productivity agenda to fuel this growth and offset inflationary headwinds. With that backdrop, we are updating our outlook this balance. We expect identical sales growth in the increased range of 2% to 2.75%, up from 1.5% to 2.5% last quarter. This assumes continuing growth in pharmacy and digital sales, as well as gradually increasing units in grocery.

From a cadence perspective, expect the second quarter ID sales to be towards the lower end of our guidance range, with gradual acceleration in the back half of the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, unchanged from last quarter. As a reminder, this includes approximately $65 million in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter related to our fifty-third week. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.16, unchanged from last quarter and including $0.03 related to the fifty-third week. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, unchanged from last quarter.

And capital expenditures are expected to be unchanged in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Looking beyond 2025, to capitalize on the investments we are making behind our strategic priorities, we continue to expect fiscal 2026 to coincide with our long-term growth algorithm of 2% plus identical sales and adjusted EBITDA growth higher than that. I will now hand the call back to Susan for closing comments.

Susan Morris: In closing, our customers for life strategy is working. We're investing in our core operations and improving our customer value proposition. These investments are driving increased traffic and growing digitally engaged customers, omnichannel households, and loyalty members. To fuel these initiatives, we are driving productivity and leveraging new technologies to drive efficiencies across our operation. As Sharon said, we continue to expect 2025 to be a year of investment, including enhancing our customer value proposition.

As a result, we expect gradual and incremental improvement in top-line trends in our grocery business in the second half of 2025, ultimately driving growth in line with our long-term algorithm of 2% plus identical sales and adjusted EBITDA growing higher than that in fiscal year 2026. With just over two months as CEO of Albertsons Companies, Inc., let me say that I am more confident in our strategy with each day. I'm energized by the work our teams are progressing and excited to continue building on our strong foundation. To our 285,000 great associates, I am more inspired than ever by you and all that you make possible for our customers and our communities each day.

No matter where you are across our business, you make a difference. To keep our systems running, ensure our products are in stock, and delight our customers. We will now open the call for questions. Thank you. Before pressing the star key. To allow for as many questions as possible, and one follow-up. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Thanks, guys.

Paul Lejuez: Curious if you could talk about the drivers of the gross margin decline this quarter, maybe find some for us, and how we should think about each of them remaining a headwind for the rest of the year, which stay, which might go away, which become less of a headwind. Maybe that you'd start with that. And then also curious how you would characterize the pricing environment around you in the competitive landscape. Thanks.

Susan Morris: Thanks, Paul. As I think about gross margins, so I we've been very clear that our top priority is driving sales and specifically driving an increase in units. And we're investing in that and remain true to that. We expect to continue that, by the way, throughout the rest of the year. As we think about Q1, it was actually one of our largest overlaps year over year. And thus the compare that you're seeing from the gross margin investment. That said, as I mentioned before, we're gonna continue to invest in margin, but we also expect our productivity to begin to provide a tailwind as our national buying gradually kicks in as the year progresses.

Also, keep in mind, our focus is on gross margin pillars.

Sharon McCollam: On EBITDA dollars, and not on rate. You had a second question about the pricing environment and if I promotional investment from the competitive set, of course, in our own operations. We're also leaning in more heavily on loyalty on personalized deals. I would say that the pricing environment is rational. So we've not seen any broad swings across the industry at this point in time. And I would just add to that you're continuing to see pressure from mass

Susan Morris: club stores and the value players. Thank you, guys. Good luck.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Our next question comes from the line of Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You made an interesting comment that e-com profitability is near break-even and improving. Just seeing if you could provide more detail on the key drivers supporting that improvement. You know, how much is Albertsons media collective a factor at this point? And what's your line of sight into reaching breakeven in that business? So, Leah, I think it's really important to recognize that different companies are calling e-commerce different things in their P&L's. When we are talking about e-commerce, that is specifically our e-commerce business.

There is nothing in our e-commerce P&L related to the media collective from a financial point of view. Of course, it creates data, for the media collective, and it is a major provider of information for the media collective, but from a P&L point of view, it's pure. What is driving that is volume. First and foremost. Leveraging the fixed cost of the operations of that business. Also, labor efficiency in the business. We've invested in tools and systems in order to drive efficiency and labor. And then we are also very much focused on continuing to leverage transportation costs in that process.

So it's across the P&L where we're seeing improvement, but in that type of a business where you've got fixed costs, that put the space in the stores, the real estate, because all that's allocated to that business. We are continuing to lever that. So we are getting very close to breakeven in our e-com business.

Sharon McCollam: Sharon, if I could just add to that as well. I know you touched on this a reminder that the our fulfillment model is through our stores. And our stores are already in the neighborhoods that are serving our customers. So that creates efficiencies for us, perhaps, versus some others out there. I think that's

Susan Morris: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then I just had a quick follow-up on the ID sales guidance. I mean, just seeing if you could comment on the cadence of ID sales throughout the quarter. And then with the deceleration that you're guiding in 2Q, just

Sharon McCollam: what are the key drivers of that? Are you seeing something change with the consumer? Is this related to the pharmacy business?

Susan Morris: Anything there would be helpful. Thank you. Leah, there's a couple of things. First and foremost, that compares on pharmacy you have to look at pharmacy growth last quarter, which we disclosed. So if you take a look at that, that has a major swing impact on the comp each quarter, so look at that. Secondly, from a cadence point of view, we feel pretty confident that as we progress through the year, we expect to see our on the grocery side of the business, we talked about the fact that we're expecting to see progressive units as we go through the back half of the year thus the price investment that we have spoken about.

So in Q2, we do need to keep in mind that there will be an impact from the strike that we had, during the quarter. So that'll have an impact, but we quantified that for you in order for you to help model. We said in our prepared remarks that we expect it to in the second quarter to be at the low end of our guidance range. So hopefully that will be helpful and we continue to expect to see strong pharmacy in the numbers going into Q2. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.

Edward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping that you could maybe take a step back and update us on your price investment goals, you know, just kinda given what you have seen so far you customer response, you know, does that give you any confidence maybe to lean in a little bit more? And then as you think about know, productivity initiatives rolling in, then you think about, you know, returning to your algo next year, is it your expectation that eventually get to the point where, you know, you will continue to invest in price, productivity offsets, gross margin is a bit more stable. Curious as to how we should be thinking about all that. Thank you.

Sharon McCollam: Sure. Thanks, Ed, for the question. So, as we think about price, just a reminder, as we went into the year, we have an incredible amount of data, and our price investments are very surgical. We know the categories and the markets. Where we need to make those investments, and we've begun that process. And keep also keeping in mind too that as we talk about investing in price, it's really investing in the total value proposition. So, yes, some of it's based pricing. It's promotional, is investing in our loyalty programs as well, and, of course, focusing on own brands. To date, it's still early. In the investment process, so we'll be able to understand a little bit more.

This is certainly a journey not something that we're is a one and done. It'll be an iterative process with multiple phases launching throughout the year. Right now, we've seen sequential improvements in our unit trajectory, which is what we expected to see.

Susan Morris: We have

Sharon McCollam: been tracking our CPI versus the competitive set, and are generally pleased with what we see. But once again, it's quite early in the process. You asked about productivity, and what I would say here is as I mentioned a moment ago, there will be a tailwind from a gross margin perspective as we implement our national buying processes. But keeping in mind too that is a process. We're working closely with our vendor partners, category by category, vendor by vendor. So we expect to see that start to show through towards the second half of the year. And expect to leave 2025 going into 2026 delivering on the long-term algorithm.

Edward Kelly: And then just maybe a follow-up on the pharmacy and grocery cross-shopping momentum. I mean, pharmacy growth has obviously been know, very impressive. But the grocery, you know, business has lagged. And I'm just curious as to you know, what's happening with, the momentum of that cross shopping activity, you know, what you're doing to know, to get those customers to engage more in the store and in over time, I mean, it seems like we should expect the grocery ID to respond to all this. I'm just kinda curious as to how you are thinking about you know, the momentum there and, you know, when that really begins to improve.

Sharon McCollam: So it's to be shared with before, it does take time for our the cross-shopping to begin between pharmacy and grocery customers. That said we know what they do. They often visit the store four times more frequently. They drive outsized customer lifetime value. They and they one of our goals with all of this is, of course, getting an engagement with both center store and pharmacy. Recognizing that if they're engaging in the pharmacy side of the business, we are working to increase their engagement with higher service offerings. Test and treat is one example. Immunizations is another. From a grocery perspective, we did see positive growth in grocery in the first quarter, exclusive of our pharmacy business.

So we were pleased to see that happening there. As I mentioned before, two words, focused on creating incredible product incredible amount of productivity in our pharmacy business

Paul Lejuez: including

Sharon McCollam: improving our sourcing, buying better increasing automation, creating solutions for our pharmacy techs and teams to create to make their jobs more efficient. We've invested in three central fill facilities. In our Southwest division, in Dallas, and in Southern Washington state, which are also helping our productivity. So again, we like the total value equation when our customers engage with us in store, in pharmacy, online. That's a virtuous flywheel for us to drive ongoing growth. And productivity, by the way. So we're very excited about the future and believe in the priorities that we've laid for us.

Edward Kelly: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.

Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to retail media, I was just curious how that ramp is going versus expectations so far and just anything surprising at this point.

Sharon McCollam: Hi, Pash. We are very pleased with progress that we're seeing on the media collectives. I Our growth is outpacing the industry. Our team has done a phenomenal job of condensing the amount of time that it takes for us to be able to give feedback to our vendor partners on performance of their investments. They're enhancing our digital properties. So that we have more inventory to be able to settle. And we are also working on really creating more streamlined personalization opportunities so that our vendor partners can have direct connections with the customers that they're serving. So we feel good about our progress there. But we also see that as some blue sky ahead.

We recognize that we're catching up in some ways, and our goal is to leap forward. But there's there's great progress there from the team. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Just on the consumer,

Rupesh Parikh: just curious what you guys are seeing right now and with the recently passed legislation, just any thoughts on SNAP impact?

Sharon McCollam: I'll start with the SNAP impact. So for us, we have a lower penetration of SNAP than majority of the competitive set that we have. That said, that customer is very important to us. They did typically have a larger basket. They're very loyal. We'll work hard to make sure that they have the communication information they need to get access to them. To resources when available.

Susan Morris: I would also add to that there when you look at the new legislation, there is a very long ramp to implementation of many of the things within that legislation. So in the short term, we don't anticipate that being a headwind of any material amount in the short term. Thanks, Sharon. And on the on the consumer side, we continue to see the customer seeking value. We're selling more on

Sharon McCollam: promotion. That's been happening for quite some time now. We're leaning heavily into owned brands. Understanding that. And as we've mentioned before, we're proud of our own brands program that we have, but we're not satisfied with the penetration that we have. So we're really leaning in for the Q2 and the rest of the year. That's upside potential for us moving ahead. As I think about the customer, we were looking at some category information and it's been interesting. Some of our top performing categories in the first quarter was kind of a tale of two cities.

We absolutely saw increases in a shift into pork and ground beef as one example, again, indicating that the customer is looking for value. We also saw strong growth in our deli chicken business as an example. Knowing that, I think, customers are always looking for quick and easy meal solutions and with these increase of food away from home, I think inflation was almost four percent. We're absolutely providing value there.

Rupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you for all the color.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.

John Heinbockel: Hey, guys. I want to start with I think you said if maybe I heard wrong, food volumes were positive in the quarter, grew Was that right? If so, is that predominantly traffic or items per basket? And then I think your goal

Sharon McCollam: is a couple of quarters ago, you talked about fifty basis points. Is that still a fair goal? You think you can do better than that?

Susan Morris: Yeah. So, John, traffic and AIV were positive. On the units. It is a sequential improvement in units from Q4 to Q1. And that is not yet to positive.

John Heinbockel: Okay.

Sharon McCollam: Then and then follow-up is if you think about you reference technology. Where do you think the most fruitful labor productivity opportunities are? Right? I think about these you guys are promotional electronic shelf labels. You know, thinking about that. Thinking about know, automation back into the warehouses. Where are the biggest opportunities to move the needle on cost per unit?

Susan Morris: John, thanks for the question. So you actually touched on a few that are very important to us today, one of which is DC automation. We've had great success with recent launches and look forward to accelerating that agenda for a variety of reasons. Efficiency being one of them. With regards to store labor, we are so have an incredible amount of data, and I think about e-commerce as one example where we've actually been able to enhance productivity because we're able to get the data that we need to create more predictive scheduling. That's really helping us create efficiencies there. That's already underway.

In the rest of the store, and we're in the process, is actually fairly robust in center store, we're working through the fresh departments.

Sharon McCollam: So

Susan Morris: wall-to-wall forecasting is what we call it, and that's gonna be a big unlock for us. We are currently in pilot on ESL and I think it's forty stores at this moment in time, seeing great results there. But to your point, we're absolutely leaning in heavily on technology and automation of tasks where we can eliminating pain points across the organization and the existing experiments on AI across the company because we see further opportunity there for efficiency.

John Heinbockel: Thank you. And also as

Susan Morris: that over the last several years, we've invested heavily in our stores in several technologies that are used by a very large number of people in our stores. We implemented Refresh, We've implemented ordering and other types of technologies. And one of the big opportunities that every retailer has. Is the utilization of that technology and there is a full court press within the company on execution in the stores and elevating that in our stores. So we are expecting to see changes and continued improvement in the stores in the utilization of the tools we currently have. Another area that we continue to invest in you have to invest in it from two perspectives.

One is the customer experience, and one of them is from a shrink perspective. But is in the self checkout. And the various things we can do with self checkout from a customer experience point of view. Using vision AI as part of that process. We saw if you saw in our prepared remarks, that we did have some favorability in shrink. Part of that, we believe, is coming from the technology that we have invested in sub checkout.

So that is another area that it benefits you in labor in many different ways, but the key to self checkout is making sure that customer experience is as great as it can be, and we're spending time on that and then ensuring that, and I believe that will help us continue to take self checkout to the next level.

Rupesh Parikh: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

Simeon Gutman: Hey, Susan. Hey, Sharon. How are you? I wanted to follow-up on pricing. Susan, I'll I ask you a about where your head is on pricing. I think you've lived in the high low environment for most of your career. So curious what this iteration looks like. Are you moving to part EDLP with Hi Lo? And you mentioned this isn't is this a one time catch up or this is iterative? And, of course, you know, open to changes down the road? And then I don't know what in the conversations with vendors, how you're communicating some of the changes as you try to work with them on the central buying.

Sharon McCollam: Damian, thanks for the question. So first and foremost, I wanna highlight the fact that and I've mentioned this a couple times and we talked about this last time. We have an incredible opportunity with our own brand. Our penetration well it's growing at 25.7% for the quarter. We should be at 30% plus. So we are leaning into that from both ends. Both from a price perspective, but also from a cost of goods perspective so we can fuel our own growth there. Going back to your price question in general, I would yes, you're right. We typically bid a high low retailer.

And if I had to describe our go-forward approach, I think we're more of a modified high low. That's that's where we're looking to achieve. And, yes, it's iterative. This is absolutely not a one-and-done. And what the team has created, which is it's actually pretty fantastic. And, Charlie, we've created a suite of tools that helps us utilize the data that we have to anticipate the changes that we're making based off of past performance of various price points understand the customer elasticities, and then feed us what those pricing changes should be to optimize unit growth, optimize profitability. And those tools are only becoming more and more robust. We continue to add to the suite.

So to I guess, to no. This is not a one-and-done. This is a new go-to-market strategy. We are deeply engaging our vendor partners, That takes time, by the way. So as we talk about our productivity, as a as a tailwind, that will come gradually over time. As we're leaning into partnerships with our vendors to say, hey, how do we do this together? We wanna move more units. We wanna move them with you. How can we lean in and create the right opportunity to grow sales and share unit sales and share collectively?

Simeon Gutman: Okay. And then switching topics for follow-up. SG and A run rate, Can you talk about I think it was up three and a half or so percent. Union contracts, I'm sure, was part of your plan at some point. Because you know when they come up and you have some expectation. Can you talk about how the unit contract could or couldn't change that run rate and any investments that come in and then you know, managing it relative to where you think comps can come in. Is it in the right range so that you could eventually leverage when you get some of the unit pickup in the back half?

Susan Morris: To me, yes. In our SG&A guidance that in our outlook for this year, we have anticipated what these increases could look like and that is incorporated in the adjusted EBITDA value that we provided for the year. As it relates to other areas in SG&A that you didn't ask about, keep in mind this quarter, we were we had a year-over-year benefit of about 63 basis points. Take a look at how much of that is one-time cost. You can see the one-time cost in our reconciliations in the press release. So about half of that comes from the elimination of departure costs. But the rest of that has been driven by productivity.

One of the big areas of productivity that we expect to see this year, early in the year particularly, is going to be in SG&A. Remember, we are materially changing our ways of working. We've had several announcements on the opening of our new headquarters in India. For technology, which we're very excited about. We are also transitioning many of our back-end accounting functions to an existing location that we have in the Philippines. And that transition is also happening. So we are making several I call we call them internally ways of working moves that are helping to offset some of the pressure that we're seeing in wages. And wages, it's your I don't wanna specifically say union wages.

It's wages in general.

Simeon Gutman: K. Thanks. Good luck.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Carden with UBS. Please proceed.

Mark Carden: Thanks so much for taking the questions. So on the pharmacy front, how did that contribution shake out from GLP one And then for the growth outside of GLP ones, is it being more driven by newer customers or more by your engaged existing customers?

Susan Morris: The JLP one question, it's about half the pharmacy comp. So think about GLP one as half the comp. However, remember, it comes in an incredibly outsized average unit retail and script growth actual script growth outside of GLP one was also very strong Susan, do you have something you'd like to add to that?

Sharon McCollam: Yeah. So and Sharon touched on it. Clearly, the profitability is quite different on the DLT one script itself, but the customer is quite valuable. What we found is there might be an initial dip when they start shopping with us in their in their grocery basket, but that quickly turns around. And actually leans into items like supplements, lean proteins in our meat department, categories that are actually quite profitable for us as a company. Sharon mentioned our course group count GLP one is very strong.

And we're that's, again, exciting to us as customers continue to engage in our total ecosystem that adds profitability, that adds long term lifetime value, So we feel very good about where we're at the pharmacy's pace. That said, and I mentioned this earlier, we are very focused on productivity there. Improving sourcing, increasing automation, and of course, the central field that I spoke of.

Mark Carden: Great. And then on tariffs, I know that indirect impacts

Sharon McCollam: were a big unknown from the ingredient and a packaging standpoint in grocery and pharmacy. Now that we're a few months in, are you expecting this to be any more or less a contributor to inflation over the course of the next few quarters relative to what you're expecting last quarter?

Susan Morris: Thank you. And yes, as we've mentioned before, well over ninety percent of the goods we source are domestically based, but to your point, ingredients are certainly playing a factor in our CPG partners and their cost of goods. We're starting to see increases in cost of goods moving ahead, and we've got a very rigorous process of first and foremost quite frankly, just pushing back. We've worked hard and it and it showed that our price as well that we've not passed through all of the inflation that we're seeing. From a cost of goods perspective.

Our first line of defense though is to push back with our vendor partners, deconstruct the costing increase, and make sure that we're all in alignment of their back rationale behind it. Looking for alternate sources of supply or other products that we can push if the tariffs become unwieldy and then finally in certain cases, if we have to, we'll pass them on to customers but we're gonna remain very close to the competitive set, especially on key items. When I start to think about commodity items that come through, which is something we do every day. By the way. You know, this is part of our DNA.

We sell a lot of commodity-driven items, and we are very agile in the pricing process there.

Sharon McCollam: And Susan, I would just add to that. It is also having us take a look

Mark Carden: at

Sharon McCollam: what we are offering in other branch. So as we look forward and we look at the tariffs, it may be that there comes a point where we decide that an expansion in our assortment and own brands is a great solution for our customer, and we're looking at that as well.

Susan Morris: Great. Thanks so much, and good luck.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Good morning, Susan and Sharon. Thanks for taking our questions. Wanted to go back to the sequential

Susan Morris: improvement in grocery units. It sounds like you were pleased with that. Just wanna clarify, would you expect that to continue into Q2, and just a pharmacy dynamic there in Q2? Just wanted to understand really what underpins that confidence regarding the stronger second half IDs, and what's the measure of that? Is that more of a grocery unit dynamic?

Sharon McCollam: Yeah. Kelly, first and foremost, in Susan's prepared remarks, her statements about the sequential improvement in units that is and we were clear. It is grocery. So when we are referring to this sequential improvement and what we expect for the balance of the year, what is important and one of our top priorities is growing units in grocery. When you now as we look for the rest of the year, we said last quarter and we continue to believe that each quarter this year, we will continue to sequentially improve grocery units.

We're making the investment in the margin We are focused on driving those units and as we get toward the back half of the year when you think about the March that remember what Susan said the productivity will start to provide a tailwind to the investment order to drive the units But we are committed to driving units through the balance of the year.

Susan Morris: Susan, do you wanna add to that? No. Sure. I think I think you said it well. The primary purpose of the investments that we're making, yes, in price, yes in loyalty, yes in home brands is literally all about driving that unit growth and driving those improvements. So we do expect it to continue We will be funding it again over time. As we mentioned, those investments and the deal with don't exactly line up. Which, again, though, fits the algorithm that we've shared.

Sharon McCollam: But that's what gives us the confidence. Your question was what gives us confidence That is why we are confident. That's that's helpful. And is there anything that you've learned as you

Susan Morris: had these discussions with, vendors in terms of more of a national buying process that makes you think about the opportunity, you know, over time and in any different way. And sizing that up in terms of the impact that could have on productivity. Yeah. So just what we're learning is we go through the process is there's an incredible opportunity for us. Right? And as you think we own our own manufacturing plants. So we understand that the more information that we can get and the further out that we're out on forecasting for our own plans creates incredible efficiencies. For production. It's no different for our vendor partners.

Who shared with us that their ability to forecast demand which by the way we're also developing have developed and then there's more in development. Various AI tools to help us create stronger and further out demand planning signals. But it's it's just a complete unlock in terms of efficiencies for everybody. It also enables us to plan further ahead and align our media collective dollars along with our digital dollars. And, of course, the cost of goods reductions that we'll see so that we can create a comprehensive program in store online to drive more traffic, and drive more units by creating this again, this total package for the customers that we serve.

Our vendors, I think, you know, we're a large company, and there are times when it's very efficient and effective for us to act.

Sharon McCollam: Locally.

Susan Morris: And be very agile, but our vendors clearly recognize that there's a significant change in our thought processes we're committed to doing this. And I'm excited about what that brings for the future.

Sharon McCollam: And in the conversations the goals that we have about driving units are completely aligned with our vendors. So we are aligned when you're aligned on the same business objective, it's very helpful and very constructive in those conversations.

Susan Morris: Yes. And to your point, sure. We have joint business plan

Sharon McCollam: goals that we put in place with most of the major CPGs. So again, we're aligned on the same targets We're leaning in together. And I really am excited about what will come in the second half of the year.

Susan Morris: Thank you.

Sharon McCollam: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your

Michael Montani: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask one on guidance and then one on the trends for the consumer. So on the guidance front, there was about a forty or fifty bit increase in ID sales. But then, obviously, EPS did not change. I just wanted to confirm, is that due to the nature of the ID sales being stronger in pharma, or was there incremental investments either in price or labor as you do the union contract negotiations that caused that?

Susan Morris: Yes. So I think I think it's a blend of some of the things that you just described. Yes. Some of the growth within our pharmacy growth continues to be outsized. Right? And that's great because we love that customer. We will love that relationship. There is an impact on profitability there. Cherish, is there anything that you would add from

Sharon McCollam: I think that throughout the year, we expect this in the total comp guidance for 2025, pharmacy is going to be biggest driver of cockspur sales growth for the year. We are continuing you know what that business doing like, and we continue to believe that we are going to continue to take share from pharmacy. On the grocery side, you will see that each quarter, we expect to see gradual and incremental improvement in units and that will, through the year, bring the grocery comp as a slightly bigger percentage of the total but on the top line, you're gonna see a bit the increase that we put in the guidance for 2025 that is pharmacy.

Michael Montani: Got it. Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then just in terms of the consumer trends, as it relates to kind of better for you product, natural, organic, and otherwise, what percent of the mix is that for you today? You know, how is that trending? And I guess, is there any surprises that you're seeing with respect to GLP one absorption and then you know, how that's impacting consumer buying behavior. Sure. So, like, what we're seeing in

Sharon McCollam: we have a we call it Noshi, natural organic specialty health and ethnic products. And those categories are growing for us. And what we're and it's interesting as you start to break it down, I think there's a few things in play. Certainly trends for you sorry. Certainly trends in better for you products. Are strong. Also interesting though, the influence that we see from specialty items like premium sparkling water is one of our top gross categories. It's it's fascinating to watch. This one oh, I had to double check the numbers, but cottage cheese. Is actually a strong growth category. Yes.

Some of that's from the focus on protein, lower carbs, perhaps GLP one users, and then just being totally frank, TikTok is driving some of that. So we're leaning into those categories. They do lend themselves Those categories pair well with some of what we see for GLP one customers. But it goes well beyond just the GLP user. We're definitely seeing overall trends focusing on health and well-being, and that works perfectly for us. As one of our five priorities is driving a cut the customer value proposition, and creating a an environment, an ecosystem that brings customers into brick and mortar, into digital, into pharmacy and health.

Michael Montani: Got it. Thank you.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Hi. This is Kendall Tiscan. I want to Robby. Thanks for taking my question. Just have a follow-up in terms of the percent of your customers that are cross shopping

Sharon McCollam: grocery and pharmacy today versus much higher you think that number could go over time. And, basically, just trying to get a sense of after four years of pharmacy growth in the double digit range, which has obviously been a huge

Susan Morris: sales driver, but a headwind to profitability. Are we nearing a point where pharmacy could eventually start to normalize or the growth rate could start to normalize?

Sharon McCollam: Thanks. Hi, Kendall. So what we're seeing is, you know, yes, of course, the cross shopping between pharmacy and grocery is pivotal for us. We do have very strong pharmacy growth, and I mentioned a lot of that is core pharmacy business. Just to sidenote on there as well, in that core pharmacy business, we continue to strive for profitability. Stronger profitability, increasing our generics mix, improving offerings such as test and treat, immunizations, those kinds of things. And then and again, creating that linkage between store and pharmacy is critical. From a the pharmacy business, I here's what I see. There's been a experience I mean, you guys see the information out there.

There's been a serious decline in the availability of doors for customers to go to take care of their pharmacies. We think that's critical. And I believe that we're well positioned with this the steps that we've made both from an acquisition perspective meaning acquiring scripts from outside, hiring the amazing pharmacists and techs that are out there that are looking for work we need more and more of that support. So we're leveraging that and becoming know, I think we're becoming helps become an essential choice for customers. I could get my groceries there. I could meet my pharmacy needs in an environment where the doors are shrinking. Right?

We have less and less opportunity in certain markets, less choices for customers, or we're happy to be there for them. So I actually see it as a vote as a competitive advantage for us moving ahead with the investments that we've made in pharmacy. And so that, again, just I can't repeat also the enough the fact that we are striving to improve the profitability there. Again, recognizing that customer's total value when we engage them in both center store as well as pharmacy is tremendous for us. We love those customers. We want to serve them.

Susan Morris: And, Susan, I would only add also, we have invested significantly in the customer experience in pharmacy, integrating it into the total company app, and being able to serve that customer including we talked last quarter, now being able to pick up your prescription at the same time that you're picking up your drive up and go order. And as we continue to create the linkage and the ease of shopping between the pharmacy plus customer and the grocery customer, we believe that does provide incremental opportunity for us as we move forward through the year and into next year.

So these investments we're making on the digital side and linking them together with everything we're doing in pharmacy and health, and then the mobile app for use in the stores, we think that is also going to make a significant difference with these cross shopping customers.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Morris for any final comments.

Sharon McCollam: Just thank you everybody for the time today. We're excited about the year come, and thank you to our associates that make all of this happen.

Susan Morris: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Susan Morris stated, ""We're starting to see increases in in cost of goods moving ahead,"" indicating that tariffs and ingredient costs may contribute to future inflationary pressure.

Susan Morris said, ""there will be an impact from the strike that we had, during the quarter.""

SUMMARY

Albertsons Companies (ACI -5.54%) reported modest top-line gains in Q1 FY2025, driven by pharmacy and digital platforms and supported by elevated investment in price and loyalty initiatives. Sequential improvement in core grocery units was noted, although total adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share declined compared to the prior year due to margin and expense headwinds. Management raised full-year guidance for identical sales growth, citing ongoing pharmacy and digital expansion confirming earlier forecasts for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Significant capital was allocated to expansion, technology upgrades, and share repurchases, underscoring the company’s multi-year strategic roadmap centered on digital engagement, labor productivity, and national buying scale.

Susan Morris said, From FY2025 through FY2027, we expect our productivity engine to deliver $1.5 billion in savings, earmarked for reinvestment in growth and cost-offsetting measures.

Susan Morris indicated that the e-commerce business is near breakeven and improving. Profitability advances attributed to volume leverage and operational efficiencies.

Store and digital platform integrations -- including app-based meal planning and omnichannel features -- are positioned as key enablers for cross-selling and customer retention.

Management stated that gross margin investment and expense leverage dynamics will gradually improve as national buying and productivity initiatives ramp in the second half of the fiscal year.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Susan Morris: Thanks, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, our teams delivered solid results with ID sales growth of 2.8%, adjusted EBITDA of $1.11 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.55. These results again demonstrate gradual and incremental progress against our five strategic priorities, which include driving customer growth and engagement through digital connection, growing our media collective, enhancing the customer value proposition, modernizing capabilities through technology, and driving transformational productivity. Within these priorities, our four digital platforms continue to be the catalyst for customer growth and engagement. We continue to drive increased sales, all while generating data and insights for the media collective.

Our first digital platform is e-commerce, which grew 25% and reached 9% of total grocery revenue in the first quarter. This growth was again led by strong performance in our first-party business, driven by award-winning capabilities and our fully integrated mobile app, and supported by our five-star certification program. Our focus on delivering exceptional customer service experience is fueling new customer acquisition and strengthening existing customer retention. To do this, we are continuing to enhance our digital shopping experience, including the introduction of AI and interactive features that deliver both ease and convenience.

For example, we launched our new shop assist feature, which enables a connected shopping experience that allows customers to communicate back and forth with our in-store associates throughout their order's fulfillment process. We've also created more flexibility in our basket building. Customers can now add items to their orders up until picking has started, recognizing that shoppers often think of one more item they need just after an order is placed. While our e-commerce penetration is still below industry peers, it is one of our biggest growth, customer acquisition, and customer retention opportunities for 2025 and beyond. From a profitability perspective, our e-commerce business is near breakeven and improving.

Our second digital platform is loyalty, which grew 14% to 47 million members in the first quarter as we capitalized on the simplification of our program and further enhanced the value the program offers. Members in the program today are engaging more frequently, using more of our easy-to-understand and redeem features, and spending more with us. As a case in point, 30% of our engaged households are now electing the cash-off option, reinforcing the customer's desire for immediate value. As we did last quarter, loyalty is a key enabler of digital engagement and a rich source of data for our media collectives.

Throughout 2025, we will continue to introduce compelling benefits that will attract new members, improve share of wallet, and further enable marketing and monetization opportunities for the media collective. We will also continue to simplify and expand the program to include strategic partnerships to offer even more value. Our third digital platform is pharmacy and health, which grew 20% year over year, driven by industry-leading script and immunization growth, best-in-class customer satisfaction scores, and the ongoing integration of pharmacy and Sincerely Health into our overall digital experience. Cross shoppers between grocery and pharmacy are exceptionally valuable.

Over time, these customers visit the store four times more often and buy significantly more groceries with us, resulting in outsized customer lifetime value across the entire store. For this reason, in addition to the market share opportunity competitor closings are creating for us, we're also continuing to invest in our pharmacy and health digital platform. Through this platform, we're also launching customized omnichannel benefits that are not only attracting new customers but also converting existing pharmacy and grocery-only customers to become cross shoppers. It is also helping customers to find new and personalized ways to improve their health and well-being, consistent with evolving national trends.

Our pharmacy and health plus platform is an integral part of our customers for life strategy and a significant growth and customer engagement opportunity. For this reason, leveraging our growing scale to improve pharmacy profitability over time is a key operational priority. To deliver this, we are continuing to pursue higher-margin service offerings and drive productivity through improved sourcing, increased automation, and labor optimization. This quarter, we opened our third central fill processing facility, which is reducing our cost of serve while at the same time improving overall customer experience. The fourth digital platform is the integration of the mobile app for use in our stores. We're not just selling food.

We're simplifying meal planning and making shopping easier and more convenient both in-store and online. Our app has become the epicenter of the omnichannel experience, with digital customers engaging nearly three times a week on average. What began as a tool for enabling e-commerce and delivering great deals is now a Swiss army knife of tools that makes customers' lives easier, regardless of whether they're shopping in our stores or online. These tools include best-in-class list building, personalized meal planning capabilities, powerful search and product locating capability, and an in-store mode that connects meal planning and other store-specific capabilities.

In our media collective in the first quarter, we significantly increased the high-impact digital inventory as our digital platforms work together to enrich our data and generate deeper customer engagement to accelerate growth and deliver superior return on ad spend. We'll continue to invest in building industry-leading integrated solutions that will support both endemic and non-endemic partners. These solutions include refining shopper audiences, running targeting media campaigns with compressed measurement timelines, and delivering consistent omni execution to develop personalized relationships for our collective partners with our customers. These same solutions are also providing benefits for our internal loyalty and marketing initiatives.

As we look forward, we expect the collective to grow faster than the retail media market and ultimately be one of the largest sources of fuel for reinvestment into our core business over time. To improve our customer value proposition, we intentionally invested in value, both loyalty and promotional offerings, as well as by partnering with strategic vendors to invest in price in certain categories and certain markets. We also surgically manage through the pass-through of cost inflation to further invest in the customer's needs for immediate value. While it is early, these investments did deliver a sequential quarterly unit sales improvement and over time are expected to drive greater existing and new customer engagement across our banners.

We additionally amplified our own brand presence to drive further value for our customers. Own brand sales penetration finished the quarter at 25.7% as we launched new offerings across multiple categories. We also expanded the assortment in our recently introduced Overjoyed brand and launched our newest brand, Chef Counter, a chef-inspired meal solution targeting foodies seeking fast and easy restaurant-quality choices at affordable prices. These launches, coupled with greater prominence and better value in OMEN, were increased digital and omnichannel household engagement and higher transaction counts over time. Our next priority is the modernization of our capabilities through technology.

As we said last quarter, our North Star is to use technology in everything we do, and we are energized by the progress we are making toward this aspiration. Our technology-first focus is positioning us to make a greater impact faster, allowing us to drive greater innovation at a lower cost. Our advanced technology platform, on which we are continuing to innovate, powers our e-commerce, store, pharmacy, supply chain, merchandising, and media collective operation. And is allowing us to leverage emerging AI technologies to accelerate our operational transformation going forward. We are also using our advanced capabilities to use AI agents to enhance many business functions, including pricing and promotion, personalization, customer care, and cogeneration, among others.

Driving transformational productivity is our next priority, which is an imperative to fuel our growth. Our productivity engine continues to reduce costs, offset headwinds, and fund our growth priorities. It works hand in hand with our technology modernization, including our initiatives to leverage AI and data analytics, optimize supply chain costs through automation, build out shrink and labor management tools, to name a few. In addition, the largest of our opportunities continues to be the leveraging of our consolidated scale to buy goods for resale through national buying and more efficient supplier relations.

As we previously shared, from fiscal year 2025 through 2027, we expect our productivity engine to deliver $1.5 billion in savings, which we plan to reinvest in growth and our customer value proposition, as well as to offset other inflationary headwinds. Before I hand the call over to Sharon for an overview of our first quarter and to provide an update to our 2025 outlook, I'd like to give you an update on recent labor negotiations. In fiscal 2025, we have negotiations covering approximately 120,000 associates. As of today, we've reached agreements covering nearly half of these associates, with two pending rectifications in Colorado and Southern California.

We appreciate and value our associates, and in these contracts, we are meaningfully improving wages and benefits. At the same time, we're working to negotiate contracts that are not only financially responsible but also provide the operational flexibility the company needs to streamline operations, manage costs, and offer affordable prices in a rapidly changing grocery landscape. Sharon, over to you.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here with you today. As Susan shared, the investments we are making are delivering value to our customers and adding breadth to the capabilities we need to drive future growth. During the quarter, we saw early wins from these investments, affirming our confidence in our strategic priorities and our customers-per-life strategy. Included in these wins was identical sales growth this quarter of 2.8%, driven by 20% growth in pharmacy and a 25% increase in digital sales. We also saw a sequential improvement in core grocery units.

To drive this growth, our gross margin rate of 27.1% was lower than last year by 85 basis points, excluding fuel and legal expense. Incremental investments in our customer value proposition and the mix shift impact related to the strong growth in our pharmacy and digital businesses drove this decrease but was partially offset by benefits driven by our productivity initiatives, including improved shrink expense. Offsetting this gross margin investment was a 63 basis point improvement, excluding fuel, in our selling and administrative expense rates. This decrease was primarily driven by the leveraging of employee costs, reflecting the positive benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives and lower merger-related costs.

Interest expense in Q1 2025 decreased $4 million to $142 million compared to $146 million last year due to lower average borrowings. Income tax expense in the first quarter totaled $75 million or 24.1%, compared to $69 million or 22.3% in Q1 last year. This tax rate increase was primarily driven by a reduction of an uncertain tax position last year that did not recur in 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.111 billion in the first quarter compared to $1.14 billion last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $0.66 per diluted share last year. Now I'd like to discuss capital allocation, the balance sheet, and cash flow.

Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, during the first quarter, we invested $585 million in capital expenditures, including the opening of three new stores and the completion of 36 remodels, as well as the ongoing modernization of our digital and technology capabilities. We also returned $401 million to our shareholders, including $86 million in quarterly dividends and $315 million in share repurchases, leaving approximately $1.5 billion in our multiyear $2 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.96. Now, let me walk you through our updated 2025 outlook. As Susan said, we remained focused on our five strategic priorities.

Through the balance of fiscal 2025, we will continue to invest in our customer value proposition, customer experience, digital growth, media collective, and health and pharmacy. These investments are expected to drive outside growth in digital and pharmacy, both of which drive higher future customer lifetime value but create near-term margin headwinds. We will also continue to drive our productivity agenda to fuel this growth and offset inflationary headwinds. With that backdrop, we are updating our outlook this balance. We expect identical sales growth in the increased range of 2% to 2.75%, up from 1.5% to 2.5% last quarter. This assumes continuing growth in pharmacy and digital sales, as well as gradually increasing units in grocery.

From a cadence perspective, expect the second quarter ID sales to be towards the lower end of our guidance range, with gradual acceleration in the back half of the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, unchanged from last quarter. As a reminder, this includes approximately $65 million in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter related to our fifty-third week. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.16, unchanged from last quarter and including $0.03 related to the fifty-third week. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, unchanged from last quarter.

And capital expenditures are expected to be unchanged in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Looking beyond 2025, to capitalize on the investments we are making behind our strategic priorities, we continue to expect fiscal 2026 to coincide with our long-term growth algorithm of 2% plus identical sales and adjusted EBITDA growth higher than that. I will now hand the call back to Susan for closing comments.

Susan Morris: In closing, our customers for life strategy is working. We're investing in our core operations and improving our customer value proposition. These investments are driving increased traffic and growing digitally engaged customers, omnichannel households, and loyalty members. To fuel these initiatives, we are driving productivity and leveraging new technologies to drive efficiencies across our operation. As Sharon said, we continue to expect 2025 to be a year of investment, including enhancing our customer value proposition.

As a result, we expect gradual and incremental improvement in top-line trends in our grocery business in the second half of 2025, ultimately driving growth in line with our long-term algorithm of 2% plus identical sales and adjusted EBITDA growing higher than that in fiscal year 2026. With just over two months as CEO of Albertsons Companies, Inc., let me say that I am more confident in our strategy with each day. I'm energized by the work our teams are progressing and excited to continue building on our strong foundation. To our 285,000 great associates, I am more inspired than ever by you and all that you make possible for our customers and our communities each day.

No matter where you are across our business, you make a difference. To keep our systems running, ensure our products are in stock, and delight our customers. We will now open the call for questions. Thank you. Before pressing the star key. To allow for as many questions as possible, and one follow-up. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Thanks, guys.

Paul Lejuez: Curious if you could talk about the drivers of the gross margin decline this quarter, maybe find some for us, and how we should think about each of them remaining a headwind for the rest of the year, which stay, which might go away, which become less of a headwind. Maybe that you'd start with that. And then also curious how you would characterize the pricing environment around you in the competitive landscape. Thanks.

Susan Morris: Thanks, Paul. As I think about gross margins, so I we've been very clear that our top priority is driving sales and specifically driving an increase in units. And we're investing in that and remain true to that. We expect to continue that, by the way, throughout the rest of the year. As we think about Q1, it was actually one of our largest overlaps year over year. And thus the compare that you're seeing from the gross margin investment. That said, as I mentioned before, we're gonna continue to invest in margin, but we also expect our productivity to begin to provide a tailwind as our national buying gradually kicks in as the year progresses.

Also, keep in mind, our focus is on gross margin pillars.

Sharon McCollam: On EBITDA dollars, and not on rate. You had a second question about the pricing environment and if I promotional investment from the competitive set, of course, in our own operations. We're also leaning in more heavily on loyalty on personalized deals. I would say that the pricing environment is rational. So we've not seen any broad swings across the industry at this point in time. And I would just add to that you're continuing to see pressure from mass

Susan Morris: club stores and the value players. Thank you, guys. Good luck.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Our next question comes from the line of Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You made an interesting comment that e-com profitability is near break-even and improving. Just seeing if you could provide more detail on the key drivers supporting that improvement. You know, how much is Albertsons media collective a factor at this point? And what's your line of sight into reaching breakeven in that business? So, Leah, I think it's really important to recognize that different companies are calling e-commerce different things in their P&L's. When we are talking about e-commerce, that is specifically our e-commerce business.

There is nothing in our e-commerce P&L related to the media collective from a financial point of view. Of course, it creates data, for the media collective, and it is a major provider of information for the media collective, but from a P&L point of view, it's pure. What is driving that is volume. First and foremost. Leveraging the fixed cost of the operations of that business. Also, labor efficiency in the business. We've invested in tools and systems in order to drive efficiency and labor. And then we are also very much focused on continuing to leverage transportation costs in that process.

So it's across the P&L where we're seeing improvement, but in that type of a business where you've got fixed costs, that put the space in the stores, the real estate, because all that's allocated to that business. We are continuing to lever that. So we are getting very close to breakeven in our e-com business.

Sharon McCollam: Sharon, if I could just add to that as well. I know you touched on this a reminder that the our fulfillment model is through our stores. And our stores are already in the neighborhoods that are serving our customers. So that creates efficiencies for us, perhaps, versus some others out there. I think that's

Susan Morris: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then I just had a quick follow-up on the ID sales guidance. I mean, just seeing if you could comment on the cadence of ID sales throughout the quarter. And then with the deceleration that you're guiding in 2Q, just

Sharon McCollam: what are the key drivers of that? Are you seeing something change with the consumer? Is this related to the pharmacy business?

Susan Morris: Anything there would be helpful. Thank you. Leah, there's a couple of things. First and foremost, that compares on pharmacy you have to look at pharmacy growth last quarter, which we disclosed. So if you take a look at that, that has a major swing impact on the comp each quarter, so look at that. Secondly, from a cadence point of view, we feel pretty confident that as we progress through the year, we expect to see our on the grocery side of the business, we talked about the fact that we're expecting to see progressive units as we go through the back half of the year thus the price investment that we have spoken about.

So in Q2, we do need to keep in mind that there will be an impact from the strike that we had, during the quarter. So that'll have an impact, but we quantified that for you in order for you to help model. We said in our prepared remarks that we expect it to in the second quarter to be at the low end of our guidance range. So hopefully that will be helpful and we continue to expect to see strong pharmacy in the numbers going into Q2. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.

Edward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping that you could maybe take a step back and update us on your price investment goals, you know, just kinda given what you have seen so far you customer response, you know, does that give you any confidence maybe to lean in a little bit more? And then as you think about know, productivity initiatives rolling in, then you think about, you know, returning to your algo next year, is it your expectation that eventually get to the point where, you know, you will continue to invest in price, productivity offsets, gross margin is a bit more stable. Curious as to how we should be thinking about all that. Thank you.

Sharon McCollam: Sure. Thanks, Ed, for the question. So, as we think about price, just a reminder, as we went into the year, we have an incredible amount of data, and our price investments are very surgical. We know the categories and the markets. Where we need to make those investments, and we've begun that process. And keep also keeping in mind too that as we talk about investing in price, it's really investing in the total value proposition. So, yes, some of it's based pricing. It's promotional, is investing in our loyalty programs as well, and, of course, focusing on own brands. To date, it's still early. In the investment process, so we'll be able to understand a little bit more.

This is certainly a journey not something that we're is a one and done. It'll be an iterative process with multiple phases launching throughout the year. Right now, we've seen sequential improvements in our unit trajectory, which is what we expected to see.

Susan Morris: We have

Sharon McCollam: been tracking our CPI versus the competitive set, and are generally pleased with what we see. But once again, it's quite early in the process. You asked about productivity, and what I would say here is as I mentioned a moment ago, there will be a tailwind from a gross margin perspective as we implement our national buying processes. But keeping in mind too that is a process. We're working closely with our vendor partners, category by category, vendor by vendor. So we expect to see that start to show through towards the second half of the year. And expect to leave 2025 going into 2026 delivering on the long-term algorithm.

Edward Kelly: And then just maybe a follow-up on the pharmacy and grocery cross-shopping momentum. I mean, pharmacy growth has obviously been know, very impressive. But the grocery, you know, business has lagged. And I'm just curious as to you know, what's happening with, the momentum of that cross shopping activity, you know, what you're doing to know, to get those customers to engage more in the store and in over time, I mean, it seems like we should expect the grocery ID to respond to all this. I'm just kinda curious as to how you are thinking about you know, the momentum there and, you know, when that really begins to improve.

Sharon McCollam: So it's to be shared with before, it does take time for our the cross-shopping to begin between pharmacy and grocery customers. That said we know what they do. They often visit the store four times more frequently. They drive outsized customer lifetime value. They and they one of our goals with all of this is, of course, getting an engagement with both center store and pharmacy. Recognizing that if they're engaging in the pharmacy side of the business, we are working to increase their engagement with higher service offerings. Test and treat is one example. Immunizations is another. From a grocery perspective, we did see positive growth in grocery in the first quarter, exclusive of our pharmacy business.

So we were pleased to see that happening there. As I mentioned before, two words, focused on creating incredible product incredible amount of productivity in our pharmacy business

Paul Lejuez: including

Sharon McCollam: improving our sourcing, buying better increasing automation, creating solutions for our pharmacy techs and teams to create to make their jobs more efficient. We've invested in three central fill facilities. In our Southwest division, in Dallas, and in Southern Washington state, which are also helping our productivity. So again, we like the total value equation when our customers engage with us in store, in pharmacy, online. That's a virtuous flywheel for us to drive ongoing growth. And productivity, by the way. So we're very excited about the future and believe in the priorities that we've laid for us.

Edward Kelly: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.

Rupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to retail media, I was just curious how that ramp is going versus expectations so far and just anything surprising at this point.

Sharon McCollam: Hi, Pash. We are very pleased with progress that we're seeing on the media collectives. I Our growth is outpacing the industry. Our team has done a phenomenal job of condensing the amount of time that it takes for us to be able to give feedback to our vendor partners on performance of their investments. They're enhancing our digital properties. So that we have more inventory to be able to settle. And we are also working on really creating more streamlined personalization opportunities so that our vendor partners can have direct connections with the customers that they're serving. So we feel good about our progress there. But we also see that as some blue sky ahead.

We recognize that we're catching up in some ways, and our goal is to leap forward. But there's there's great progress there from the team. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Just on the consumer,

Rupesh Parikh: just curious what you guys are seeing right now and with the recently passed legislation, just any thoughts on SNAP impact?

Sharon McCollam: I'll start with the SNAP impact. So for us, we have a lower penetration of SNAP than majority of the competitive set that we have. That said, that customer is very important to us. They did typically have a larger basket. They're very loyal. We'll work hard to make sure that they have the communication information they need to get access to them. To resources when available.

Susan Morris: I would also add to that there when you look at the new legislation, there is a very long ramp to implementation of many of the things within that legislation. So in the short term, we don't anticipate that being a headwind of any material amount in the short term. Thanks, Sharon. And on the on the consumer side, we continue to see the customer seeking value. We're selling more on

Sharon McCollam: promotion. That's been happening for quite some time now. We're leaning heavily into owned brands. Understanding that. And as we've mentioned before, we're proud of our own brands program that we have, but we're not satisfied with the penetration that we have. So we're really leaning in for the Q2 and the rest of the year. That's upside potential for us moving ahead. As I think about the customer, we were looking at some category information and it's been interesting. Some of our top performing categories in the first quarter was kind of a tale of two cities.

We absolutely saw increases in a shift into pork and ground beef as one example, again, indicating that the customer is looking for value. We also saw strong growth in our deli chicken business as an example. Knowing that, I think, customers are always looking for quick and easy meal solutions and with these increase of food away from home, I think inflation was almost four percent. We're absolutely providing value there.

Rupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you for all the color.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.

John Heinbockel: Hey, guys. I want to start with I think you said if maybe I heard wrong, food volumes were positive in the quarter, grew Was that right? If so, is that predominantly traffic or items per basket? And then I think your goal

Sharon McCollam: is a couple of quarters ago, you talked about fifty basis points. Is that still a fair goal? You think you can do better than that?

Susan Morris: Yeah. So, John, traffic and AIV were positive. On the units. It is a sequential improvement in units from Q4 to Q1. And that is not yet to positive.

John Heinbockel: Okay.

Sharon McCollam: Then and then follow-up is if you think about you reference technology. Where do you think the most fruitful labor productivity opportunities are? Right? I think about these you guys are promotional electronic shelf labels. You know, thinking about that. Thinking about know, automation back into the warehouses. Where are the biggest opportunities to move the needle on cost per unit?

Susan Morris: John, thanks for the question. So you actually touched on a few that are very important to us today, one of which is DC automation. We've had great success with recent launches and look forward to accelerating that agenda for a variety of reasons. Efficiency being one of them. With regards to store labor, we are so have an incredible amount of data, and I think about e-commerce as one example where we've actually been able to enhance productivity because we're able to get the data that we need to create more predictive scheduling. That's really helping us create efficiencies there. That's already underway.

In the rest of the store, and we're in the process, is actually fairly robust in center store, we're working through the fresh departments.

Sharon McCollam: So

Susan Morris: wall-to-wall forecasting is what we call it, and that's gonna be a big unlock for us. We are currently in pilot on ESL and I think it's forty stores at this moment in time, seeing great results there. But to your point, we're absolutely leaning in heavily on technology and automation of tasks where we can eliminating pain points across the organization and the existing experiments on AI across the company because we see further opportunity there for efficiency.

John Heinbockel: Thank you. And also as

Susan Morris: that over the last several years, we've invested heavily in our stores in several technologies that are used by a very large number of people in our stores. We implemented Refresh, We've implemented ordering and other types of technologies. And one of the big opportunities that every retailer has. Is the utilization of that technology and there is a full court press within the company on execution in the stores and elevating that in our stores. So we are expecting to see changes and continued improvement in the stores in the utilization of the tools we currently have. Another area that we continue to invest in you have to invest in it from two perspectives.

One is the customer experience, and one of them is from a shrink perspective. But is in the self checkout. And the various things we can do with self checkout from a customer experience point of view. Using vision AI as part of that process. We saw if you saw in our prepared remarks, that we did have some favorability in shrink. Part of that, we believe, is coming from the technology that we have invested in sub checkout.

So that is another area that it benefits you in labor in many different ways, but the key to self checkout is making sure that customer experience is as great as it can be, and we're spending time on that and then ensuring that, and I believe that will help us continue to take self checkout to the next level.

Rupesh Parikh: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

Simeon Gutman: Hey, Susan. Hey, Sharon. How are you? I wanted to follow-up on pricing. Susan, I'll I ask you a about where your head is on pricing. I think you've lived in the high low environment for most of your career. So curious what this iteration looks like. Are you moving to part EDLP with Hi Lo? And you mentioned this isn't is this a one time catch up or this is iterative? And, of course, you know, open to changes down the road? And then I don't know what in the conversations with vendors, how you're communicating some of the changes as you try to work with them on the central buying.

Sharon McCollam: Damian, thanks for the question. So first and foremost, I wanna highlight the fact that and I've mentioned this a couple times and we talked about this last time. We have an incredible opportunity with our own brand. Our penetration well it's growing at 25.7% for the quarter. We should be at 30% plus. So we are leaning into that from both ends. Both from a price perspective, but also from a cost of goods perspective so we can fuel our own growth there. Going back to your price question in general, I would yes, you're right. We typically bid a high low retailer.

And if I had to describe our go-forward approach, I think we're more of a modified high low. That's that's where we're looking to achieve. And, yes, it's iterative. This is absolutely not a one-and-done. And what the team has created, which is it's actually pretty fantastic. And, Charlie, we've created a suite of tools that helps us utilize the data that we have to anticipate the changes that we're making based off of past performance of various price points understand the customer elasticities, and then feed us what those pricing changes should be to optimize unit growth, optimize profitability. And those tools are only becoming more and more robust. We continue to add to the suite.

So to I guess, to no. This is not a one-and-done. This is a new go-to-market strategy. We are deeply engaging our vendor partners, That takes time, by the way. So as we talk about our productivity, as a as a tailwind, that will come gradually over time. As we're leaning into partnerships with our vendors to say, hey, how do we do this together? We wanna move more units. We wanna move them with you. How can we lean in and create the right opportunity to grow sales and share unit sales and share collectively?

Simeon Gutman: Okay. And then switching topics for follow-up. SG and A run rate, Can you talk about I think it was up three and a half or so percent. Union contracts, I'm sure, was part of your plan at some point. Because you know when they come up and you have some expectation. Can you talk about how the unit contract could or couldn't change that run rate and any investments that come in and then you know, managing it relative to where you think comps can come in. Is it in the right range so that you could eventually leverage when you get some of the unit pickup in the back half?

Susan Morris: To me, yes. In our SG&A guidance that in our outlook for this year, we have anticipated what these increases could look like and that is incorporated in the adjusted EBITDA value that we provided for the year. As it relates to other areas in SG&A that you didn't ask about, keep in mind this quarter, we were we had a year-over-year benefit of about 63 basis points. Take a look at how much of that is one-time cost. You can see the one-time cost in our reconciliations in the press release. So about half of that comes from the elimination of departure costs. But the rest of that has been driven by productivity.

One of the big areas of productivity that we expect to see this year, early in the year particularly, is going to be in SG&A. Remember, we are materially changing our ways of working. We've had several announcements on the opening of our new headquarters in India. For technology, which we're very excited about. We are also transitioning many of our back-end accounting functions to an existing location that we have in the Philippines. And that transition is also happening. So we are making several I call we call them internally ways of working moves that are helping to offset some of the pressure that we're seeing in wages. And wages, it's your I don't wanna specifically say union wages.

It's wages in general.

Simeon Gutman: K. Thanks. Good luck.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Carden with UBS. Please proceed.

Mark Carden: Thanks so much for taking the questions. So on the pharmacy front, how did that contribution shake out from GLP one And then for the growth outside of GLP ones, is it being more driven by newer customers or more by your engaged existing customers?

Susan Morris: The JLP one question, it's about half the pharmacy comp. So think about GLP one as half the comp. However, remember, it comes in an incredibly outsized average unit retail and script growth actual script growth outside of GLP one was also very strong Susan, do you have something you'd like to add to that?

Sharon McCollam: Yeah. So and Sharon touched on it. Clearly, the profitability is quite different on the DLT one script itself, but the customer is quite valuable. What we found is there might be an initial dip when they start shopping with us in their in their grocery basket, but that quickly turns around. And actually leans into items like supplements, lean proteins in our meat department, categories that are actually quite profitable for us as a company. Sharon mentioned our course group count GLP one is very strong.

And we're that's, again, exciting to us as customers continue to engage in our total ecosystem that adds profitability, that adds long term lifetime value, So we feel very good about where we're at the pharmacy's pace. That said, and I mentioned this earlier, we are very focused on productivity there. Improving sourcing, increasing automation, and of course, the central field that I spoke of.

Mark Carden: Great. And then on tariffs, I know that indirect impacts

Sharon McCollam: were a big unknown from the ingredient and a packaging standpoint in grocery and pharmacy. Now that we're a few months in, are you expecting this to be any more or less a contributor to inflation over the course of the next few quarters relative to what you're expecting last quarter?

Susan Morris: Thank you. And yes, as we've mentioned before, well over ninety percent of the goods we source are domestically based, but to your point, ingredients are certainly playing a factor in our CPG partners and their cost of goods. We're starting to see increases in cost of goods moving ahead, and we've got a very rigorous process of first and foremost quite frankly, just pushing back. We've worked hard and it and it showed that our price as well that we've not passed through all of the inflation that we're seeing. From a cost of goods perspective.

Our first line of defense though is to push back with our vendor partners, deconstruct the costing increase, and make sure that we're all in alignment of their back rationale behind it. Looking for alternate sources of supply or other products that we can push if the tariffs become unwieldy and then finally in certain cases, if we have to, we'll pass them on to customers but we're gonna remain very close to the competitive set, especially on key items. When I start to think about commodity items that come through, which is something we do every day. By the way. You know, this is part of our DNA.

We sell a lot of commodity-driven items, and we are very agile in the pricing process there.

Sharon McCollam: And Susan, I would just add to that. It is also having us take a look

Mark Carden: at

Sharon McCollam: what we are offering in other branch. So as we look forward and we look at the tariffs, it may be that there comes a point where we decide that an expansion in our assortment and own brands is a great solution for our customer, and we're looking at that as well.

Susan Morris: Great. Thanks so much, and good luck.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Good morning, Susan and Sharon. Thanks for taking our questions. Wanted to go back to the sequential

Susan Morris: improvement in grocery units. It sounds like you were pleased with that. Just wanna clarify, would you expect that to continue into Q2, and just a pharmacy dynamic there in Q2? Just wanted to understand really what underpins that confidence regarding the stronger second half IDs, and what's the measure of that? Is that more of a grocery unit dynamic?

Sharon McCollam: Yeah. Kelly, first and foremost, in Susan's prepared remarks, her statements about the sequential improvement in units that is and we were clear. It is grocery. So when we are referring to this sequential improvement and what we expect for the balance of the year, what is important and one of our top priorities is growing units in grocery. When you now as we look for the rest of the year, we said last quarter and we continue to believe that each quarter this year, we will continue to sequentially improve grocery units.

We're making the investment in the margin We are focused on driving those units and as we get toward the back half of the year when you think about the March that remember what Susan said the productivity will start to provide a tailwind to the investment order to drive the units But we are committed to driving units through the balance of the year.

Susan Morris: Susan, do you wanna add to that? No. Sure. I think I think you said it well. The primary purpose of the investments that we're making, yes, in price, yes in loyalty, yes in home brands is literally all about driving that unit growth and driving those improvements. So we do expect it to continue We will be funding it again over time. As we mentioned, those investments and the deal with don't exactly line up. Which, again, though, fits the algorithm that we've shared.

Sharon McCollam: But that's what gives us the confidence. Your question was what gives us confidence That is why we are confident. That's that's helpful. And is there anything that you've learned as you

Susan Morris: had these discussions with, vendors in terms of more of a national buying process that makes you think about the opportunity, you know, over time and in any different way. And sizing that up in terms of the impact that could have on productivity. Yeah. So just what we're learning is we go through the process is there's an incredible opportunity for us. Right? And as you think we own our own manufacturing plants. So we understand that the more information that we can get and the further out that we're out on forecasting for our own plans creates incredible efficiencies. For production. It's no different for our vendor partners.

Who shared with us that their ability to forecast demand which by the way we're also developing have developed and then there's more in development. Various AI tools to help us create stronger and further out demand planning signals. But it's it's just a complete unlock in terms of efficiencies for everybody. It also enables us to plan further ahead and align our media collective dollars along with our digital dollars. And, of course, the cost of goods reductions that we'll see so that we can create a comprehensive program in store online to drive more traffic, and drive more units by creating this again, this total package for the customers that we serve.

Our vendors, I think, you know, we're a large company, and there are times when it's very efficient and effective for us to act.

Sharon McCollam: Locally.

Susan Morris: And be very agile, but our vendors clearly recognize that there's a significant change in our thought processes we're committed to doing this. And I'm excited about what that brings for the future.

Sharon McCollam: And in the conversations the goals that we have about driving units are completely aligned with our vendors. So we are aligned when you're aligned on the same business objective, it's very helpful and very constructive in those conversations.

Susan Morris: Yes. And to your point, sure. We have joint business plan

Sharon McCollam: goals that we put in place with most of the major CPGs. So again, we're aligned on the same targets We're leaning in together. And I really am excited about what will come in the second half of the year.

Susan Morris: Thank you.

Sharon McCollam: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your

Michael Montani: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask one on guidance and then one on the trends for the consumer. So on the guidance front, there was about a forty or fifty bit increase in ID sales. But then, obviously, EPS did not change. I just wanted to confirm, is that due to the nature of the ID sales being stronger in pharma, or was there incremental investments either in price or labor as you do the union contract negotiations that caused that?

Susan Morris: Yes. So I think I think it's a blend of some of the things that you just described. Yes. Some of the growth within our pharmacy growth continues to be outsized. Right? And that's great because we love that customer. We will love that relationship. There is an impact on profitability there. Cherish, is there anything that you would add from

Sharon McCollam: I think that throughout the year, we expect this in the total comp guidance for 2025, pharmacy is going to be biggest driver of cockspur sales growth for the year. We are continuing you know what that business doing like, and we continue to believe that we are going to continue to take share from pharmacy. On the grocery side, you will see that each quarter, we expect to see gradual and incremental improvement in units and that will, through the year, bring the grocery comp as a slightly bigger percentage of the total but on the top line, you're gonna see a bit the increase that we put in the guidance for 2025 that is pharmacy.

Michael Montani: Got it. Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then just in terms of the consumer trends, as it relates to kind of better for you product, natural, organic, and otherwise, what percent of the mix is that for you today? You know, how is that trending? And I guess, is there any surprises that you're seeing with respect to GLP one absorption and then you know, how that's impacting consumer buying behavior. Sure. So, like, what we're seeing in

Sharon McCollam: we have a we call it Noshi, natural organic specialty health and ethnic products. And those categories are growing for us. And what we're and it's interesting as you start to break it down, I think there's a few things in play. Certainly trends for you sorry. Certainly trends in better for you products. Are strong. Also interesting though, the influence that we see from specialty items like premium sparkling water is one of our top gross categories. It's it's fascinating to watch. This one oh, I had to double check the numbers, but cottage cheese. Is actually a strong growth category. Yes.

Some of that's from the focus on protein, lower carbs, perhaps GLP one users, and then just being totally frank, TikTok is driving some of that. So we're leaning into those categories. They do lend themselves Those categories pair well with some of what we see for GLP one customers. But it goes well beyond just the GLP user. We're definitely seeing overall trends focusing on health and well-being, and that works perfectly for us. As one of our five priorities is driving a cut the customer value proposition, and creating a an environment, an ecosystem that brings customers into brick and mortar, into digital, into pharmacy and health.

Michael Montani: Got it. Thank you.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Hi. This is Kendall Tiscan. I want to Robby. Thanks for taking my question. Just have a follow-up in terms of the percent of your customers that are cross shopping

Sharon McCollam: grocery and pharmacy today versus much higher you think that number could go over time. And, basically, just trying to get a sense of after four years of pharmacy growth in the double digit range, which has obviously been a huge

Susan Morris: sales driver, but a headwind to profitability. Are we nearing a point where pharmacy could eventually start to normalize or the growth rate could start to normalize?

Sharon McCollam: Thanks. Hi, Kendall. So what we're seeing is, you know, yes, of course, the cross shopping between pharmacy and grocery is pivotal for us. We do have very strong pharmacy growth, and I mentioned a lot of that is core pharmacy business. Just to sidenote on there as well, in that core pharmacy business, we continue to strive for profitability. Stronger profitability, increasing our generics mix, improving offerings such as test and treat, immunizations, those kinds of things. And then and again, creating that linkage between store and pharmacy is critical. From a the pharmacy business, I here's what I see. There's been a experience I mean, you guys see the information out there.

There's been a serious decline in the availability of doors for customers to go to take care of their pharmacies. We think that's critical. And I believe that we're well positioned with this the steps that we've made both from an acquisition perspective meaning acquiring scripts from outside, hiring the amazing pharmacists and techs that are out there that are looking for work we need more and more of that support. So we're leveraging that and becoming know, I think we're becoming helps become an essential choice for customers. I could get my groceries there. I could meet my pharmacy needs in an environment where the doors are shrinking. Right?

We have less and less opportunity in certain markets, less choices for customers, or we're happy to be there for them. So I actually see it as a vote as a competitive advantage for us moving ahead with the investments that we've made in pharmacy. And so that, again, just I can't repeat also the enough the fact that we are striving to improve the profitability there. Again, recognizing that customer's total value when we engage them in both center store as well as pharmacy is tremendous for us. We love those customers. We want to serve them.

Susan Morris: And, Susan, I would only add also, we have invested significantly in the customer experience in pharmacy, integrating it into the total company app, and being able to serve that customer including we talked last quarter, now being able to pick up your prescription at the same time that you're picking up your drive up and go order. And as we continue to create the linkage and the ease of shopping between the pharmacy plus customer and the grocery customer, we believe that does provide incremental opportunity for us as we move forward through the year and into next year.

So these investments we're making on the digital side and linking them together with everything we're doing in pharmacy and health, and then the mobile app for use in the stores, we think that is also going to make a significant difference with these cross shopping customers.

Sharon McCollam: Thank you.

Susan Morris: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Morris for any final comments.

Sharon McCollam: Just thank you everybody for the time today. We're excited about the year come, and thank you to our associates that make all of this happen.",https://cdn.content.foolcdn.com/images/1umn9qeh/production/b4204f36ed605fc54d4ba32e2cb31d1dd892afd6-800x450.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 13:24:32.034935

Key Takeaways

Bank of New York Mellon reported better-than-anticipated quarterly results as interest income and fees increased.

CEO Robin Vince said the bank benefited from its new commercial model launched a year ago.

Bank of New York Mellon also raised its dividend.

Bank of New York Mellon (BK) shares traded at an all-time high as the bank posted better-than-expected quarterly results on higher interest income and fees. It also raised its dividend.

BNY reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.94 on revenue that rose 9% year-over-year to $5.03 billion. Both figures exceeded analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.

Net interest income jumped 17% year-over-year to $1.20 billion on “the continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields and balance sheet growth.” Fee revenue grew 7% to $3.64 billion, which BNY said was primarily driven by “net new business, higher market values, client activity and foreign exchange revenue, and the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.” Assets under management increased 3% to $2.11 trillion.

CEO Robin Vince credited the strong performance to the company’s new commercial model launched last summer.

BNY also boosted its quarterly dividend to $0.53 from $0.47.

With Tuesday's gains, BNY shares have added nearly a quarter of their value this year.

Looking ahead, Albertsons has increased its expectations for identical-sales growth for fiscal 2025, raising it to the range of 2.0% to 2.75% from its previous outlook of 1.5% to 2.5%, in part because of anticipated ongoing growth in pharmacy and digital sales.

Unchanged expectations include adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, adjusted net income per Class A common share in the range of $2.03 to $2.16 per share, and capital expenditures in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.

Morris added: ""As we look forward to the balance of fiscal 2025, we do so with continued confidence in our Customers for Life strategy. We want to thank our teams for delivering these results and for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and supporting the communities in which we operate.""

Albertsons' five strategic priorities are driving customer growth and engagement through digital connection, growing its media collective, enhancing the customer value proposition, modernizing capabilities through technology, and driving transformational productivity.",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2025-01/albertsons_teaser_2406451673.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 13:24:46.033349

Dive Brief:

Medtronic said Tuesday it received the CE mark in Europe for its LigaSure vessel-sealing technology for use in robotic-assisted surgeries.

The designation increases the capabilities of Medtronic’s Hugo soft tissue robotic system for gynecologic, general and urologic procedures in Europe.

Hugo is not yet for sale in the U.S. Medtronic said it expects Hugo to enter the U.S. market later in the company’s current fiscal year, which ends in April 2026, with an initial indication in urology.

Dive Insight:

Medtronic is continuing its push into the fast-growing robotic surgery market led by Intuitive Surgical.

Expansion of the Hugo platform is key to the company’s strategy for improving growth in its surgical business, and the market-leading LigaSure vessel sealing technology is attracting strong surgeon adoption and taking share in the advanced energy field, CEO Geoff Martha told investors on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in May.

In its CE mark announcement at the Society of Robotic Surgeons Annual Meeting in Strasbourg, France, Medtronic said the LigaSure device reliably seals vessels in about two seconds and minimizes the spread of thermal energy to the surrounding tissue.

“LigaSure technology is one of the most important advances for minimally invasive surgery because it provides sealing and cutting in a way that is very, very secure for the performance of the surgeon and the security of the patient,” Miguel Caceres, of the Pacifica Salud Hospital in Panama, said in Medtronic’s statement. “As a robotic surgeon, we want LigaSure technology because it gives us confidence in the security of the seal.”

Hugo first gained the CE mark in Europe in 2021 and is now in use in more than 30 countries. In the U.S., the medical device giant submitted its application to the Food and Drug Administration for a urology indication for Hugo in the first quarter of this calendar year.

ID21,Instacart,2025-07-15 15:48:48+00:00,ABC7 New York,New York City Council passes bills boosting pay for grocery delivery workers - abc7NY,"Phil Taitt, Eyewitness News",,,,,https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-council-expected-pass-bills-boosting-pay-grocery-delivery-workers/17112572/,"NEW YORK (WABC) -- The New York City Council passed a series of bills Monday to boost pay that will include nearly 20,000 grocery delivery workers.

For thousands of delivery workers like me, tips are not a bonus-they're a vital part of our income.","NEW YORK (WABC) -- The New York City Council passed a series of bills Monday to boost pay that will include nearly 20,000 grocery delivery workers.

The new legislation requires third-party apps to pay workers $21.44 an hour, which matches the increase that food delivery workers received back in April.

""I am happy to help move this city forward and make sure all delivery workers are treated fairly, no matter what app they're on. Right now, grocery and goods delivery workers are left out of the protections food delivery workers already have. This bill closes that gap. It doesn't take anything away-it just says: if you're doing the same work, you deserve the same protections,"" said New York City Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez.

Previous bills passed in 2021 set a minimum pay and addressed working conditions for app-based food delivery workers for companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub.

Reaction from the delivery apps to this new law varies. DoorDash and Grubhub seem fine with it, with DoorDash calling it, ""a pragmatic step towards treating all delivery workers consistently, regardless of what they deliver.""

But Instacart reacted strongly against it, saying it will dramatically drive up food delivery costs.

""It is simply unconscionable that the City Council is considering a bill that would jeopardize a lifeline thousands of New Yorkers rely on,"" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.

That's not an argument swaying co-sponsor and City Council Member Sandy Nurse.

""All delivery workers deserve to get paid a decent wage for their work, no matter what they deliver or who they work for. That's why I am proud to pass Intro 1135 to raise the minimum pay rate for tens of thousands of third-party grocery delivery workers,"" Nurse said. ""These workers - many of whom come from immigrant communities - are being paid poverty wages simply because they deliver items, and sometimes even the same item, on a different app. This two-tiered wage system inhibits our goal to make NYC more affordable and livable, and as these sectors grow we refuse to leave these immigrant workers behind.""

For Nurse, a former delivery worker herself, this legislation hits home.

""These are multi-million dollar companies making a lot of money by having a lot of workers they don't have any obligations to, but we also have power here,"" Nurse said. ""It is an obligation of local government to study this industry, monitor it and take action, and that's what we're doing.""

Other protections that will now be made available includes companies to provide an option in their apps to give at least a 10% tip, before or at the same time an order is placed and that the companies must pay workers within seven days of the end of a pay period.

Advocates say the pay parity for delivery workers, regardless of sector, or the size of the app company they work for, has been a long time coming.

""I fully support this legislation to bring back the option for customers to leave a tip before completing their food order. For thousands of delivery workers like me, tips are not a bonus-they're a vital part of our income. When customers can tip upfront, it gives us motivation and a sense of appreciation for the hard work we do every day-rain or shine, cold or heat. This change isn't just about money-it's about respect,"" said Antonio Solis, a delivery worker and organizing leader with Los Deliveristas Unidos. ""I'm urging lawmakers to support this proposal. It may seem like a small change, but for us, it makes a big difference. It's a concrete step toward recognizing and dignifying the essential work we do.""

The food delivery service industry boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic and has only grown since then with over 100 million deliveries from third party apps.

Historical data from 2022 to present shows that stocks with positive earnings surprises have delivered moderate returns, with the maximum market impact at 0.15%—reinforcing BNY Mellon's resilience amid current conditions.
Conclusion BNY Mellon's Q2 results affirm its status as a defensive yet growth-oriented financial institution.","BNY Mellon (BK) delivered a strong Q2 2025 earnings report, with net interest income (NII) surging 17% year-over-year to surpass analyst expectations, driven by stable interest rates and disciplined balance sheet management. Despite rising operational costs, the bank's robust capital metrics, global expansion initiatives, and dividend growth strategy underscore its position as a resilient investment in an uncertain macroeconomic environment.

NII Growth: A Foundation for Sustainable Profitability

BNY Mellon's NII expansion reflects strategic reinvestment of maturing securities at higher yields, aided by the Federal Reserve's decision to hold the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5% during the quarter. This stability, coupled with modest loan growth, enabled NII to outperform the 11.8% consensus estimate. The net interest margin (NIM) expanded to 1.30%, a 11 basis point increase year-over-year, signaling efficient asset allocation.

The bank's focus on interest-sensitive assets has positioned it to capitalize on prolonged higher rates, even as peers face pressure from rising funding costs. Management reaffirmed its mid-single-digit NII growth guidance for 2025, supported by a $55.8 trillion asset custody portfolio—a 13% annual increase—driven by rising market values and cross-border client demand.

Balancing Costs and Capital Strength

While total expenses rose 5.3% year-over-year to $3.25 billion, the increase was largely attributable to technology upgrades, restructuring, and inflationary pressures. Non-interest expenses now account for 65% of revenue, up from 63% in Q1 2025, prompting cautious monitoring of expense discipline. However, the bank's capital ratios remain robust: the CET1 ratio held steady at 11.5%, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio improved to 6.2%, exceeding regulatory requirements.

The liquidity coverage ratio (116%) and net stable funding ratio (132%) further underscore BNY Mellon's ability to weather volatility. This strength supports its decision to raise the quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.53 per share, pending board approval—a move reflecting confidence in sustained profitability.

Global Expansion and Innovation: Key Growth Drivers

BNY Mellon's Q2 results highlight the success of its global expansion strategy. The Securities Services segment, benefiting from higher market volatility and trade volumes, saw fee revenue rise 7%, while issuer services revenue jumped 17%. The launch of its AI-powered platform “Eliza,” now used by over 8,000 employees, is driving operational efficiency and cross-selling opportunities.

The bank's tripling of currencies offered for cross-border payments and its focus on emerging markets—particularly in Asia and the Middle East—signal a commitment to capturing growth in high-potential regions. This diversification reduces reliance on fee-based revenue, which has historically been volatile, and aligns with its platform-oriented business model.

Investment Thesis: A Buy Amid Mixed Signals

BNY Mellon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) reflects its strong fundamentals, though its Earnings ESP of -0.14% suggests limited upside surprise potential for Q2. However, the stock's P/E ratio of 13.2x remains undervalued relative to its growth prospects, and analysts have raised 2025 EPS estimates by 0.2% over the past month. Historical data from 2022 to present shows that stocks with positive earnings surprises have delivered moderate returns, with the maximum market impact at 0.15%—reinforcing BNY Mellon's resilience amid current conditions.

Investors should prioritize BNY Mellon for its:

1. Resilient Balance Sheet: Strong capital ratios and liquidity buffers provide a cushion against economic downturns.

2. Dividend Stability: The 13% dividend increase underscores management's confidence and commitment to shareholder returns.

3. Strategic Initiatives: AI integration and geographic diversification position it to outperform peers in the long term.

While expenses remain a near-term headwind, the bank's ability to grow NII and maintain fee revenue momentum suggests sustainable profitability. The absence of merger speculation with Northern Trust—deemed unlikely due to regulatory hurdles—also reduces uncertainty, allowing BNY Mellon to focus on organic growth.

Conclusion

BNY Mellon's Q2 results affirm its status as a defensive yet growth-oriented financial institution. Despite elevated expenses, its NII resilience, capital strength, and global expansion efforts make it a compelling long-term investment. With a dividend yield of 2.8% and a PEG ratio below 1.0, the stock offers attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors seeking stability in volatile markets.

The path forward hinges on managing expenses, maintaining NII growth, and executing its digital transformation. For now, BNY Mellon remains a top pick in the banking sector, balancing prudent financial stewardship with innovation-driven expansion.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 15:14:57.997494

The company’s “identical sales,” which measure stores open for at least a year, increased 2.8%, helping Albertsons bring in a profit of $236.4 million in the quarter that ended on June 14th. Albertsons’ profit was down just slightly from the same time a year ago, partly because the revenue growth came from pharmacy and digital sales — two areas that carry higher costs.

“In the first quarter, we delivered solid operating and financial performance, while investing in our core operations and improving our customer value proposition,” CEO Susan Morris said. “Ongoing investments in our strategic priorities drove increased engagement across our digital platforms, evidenced by strong growth in our digital sales, pharmacy operations, and membership in our loyalty program.”

Albertsons doesn’t say how much of its revenue comes through its digital platforms, which include delivery and drive-up-and-go services, so it is impossible to know how much of the company’s business comes through e-commerce.

As BoiseDev reported in May, Albertsons said GLP-1 weight loss drugs have helped drive pharmacy sales. It has also seen a lift from the closure of scores of Rite Aid and Walgreens stores across the country. It plans to buy the customer lists for many Rite Aid stores, which are in the process of closing.

Albertsons said in April it expected its full-year earnings in the range of $2.03 to $2.16 per share, well below what analysts expected, which dinged the stock. Albertsons again said it expected the full-year profits in that range, and investors again sold off the stock, driving down the share price more than 1% by midday Tuesday.

Designers and brands gain more space for visual storytelling and eye-catching graphics on recycling-friendly mono-material packaging – now even on the inside of food packaging.

Whether it is elegant touches for premium chocolates, playful elements for children’s snacks, or bold branding on takeaway boxes, HYDRO-X CONTACT offers maximum design flexibility and brilliant print quality across every surface. At the same time, it supports recyclability and contributes to more sustainable packaging solutions.

With HYDRO-X CONTACT, hubergroup adds a new dimension to its HYDRO-X system. Optimized for flexographic printing on central impression and stack presses, HYDRO-X CONTACT integrates easily into existing press workflows – fast, efficient, and consistent.

HYDRO-X CONTACT also plays a pivotal role in the transition from film-based to paper-based packaging – both in terms of functionality and design. By eliminating the need for additional plastic barriers in certain applications, it simplifies packaging structures and frees up more printable space for bold visuals, branding, and creative storytelling.

Together with hubergroup’s wider range of sustainable technologies – including barriers against grease, water, vapor, and oxygen, as well as heat-sealable overprint varnishes – HYDRO-X CONTACT helps unlock packaging concepts that are both highly functional and recyclable.

Water-based printing inks and varnishes such as HYDRO-X can reduce VOC emissions, promote recyclability and thus support the transition to a circular economy for packaging.

“HYDRO-X CONTACT combines food safety standards with practical advantages for printers – it is easy to process, with excellent colour appearance and reliable results,” says André Garber, head of business development water-based systems and UV coatings at hubergroup. “It is also a future-proof solution that aligns perfectly with evolving EU packaging regulations.”

Tee hee.

Dylan Mulvaney, an obvious guy who runs around mocking women by pretending to be the most obnoxious woman on the planet, partnered with Bud Light in early 2023 to hype the brand on social media. The fallout was immediate, brutal, and now we know it might be irreversible.

“Beer sales over the July 4th holiday weekend came in stronger than previously expected,” reports ZeroHedge. “Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) also posted a solid performance during the period, though one brand under its adult beverage umbrella remained a clear laggard. Unsurprisingly, it was Bud Light, still struggling to recover for reasons that need little explanation.” [emphasis original]

RELATED: Oli London — Dylan Mulvaney Is Probably “Internet’s Biggest Grifter”

Over the 4th of July weekend, which delivered weather all over the country ideal for beer drinking, “Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) led all manufacturers, with 52% of distributors reporting higher volumes vs last year [but] Bud Light remains a drag—74% reported lower volumes; marketing support remains weak.”

Over this coming weekend, we can all celebrate the two-year anniversary of Anheuser-Busch CEO Michel Doukeris claiming the fallout from the madness of hiring a dude in womanface who performs the equivalent of a female minstrel show was no big deal…

“The Bud Light volume decline in the U.S. over the first three weeks of April, as publicly reported, would represent around 1% of our overall global volumes for that period,” he said during an earnings call in July of 2023. “This was the result of one can. It was not made for production or sale to the general public. It was one post, not a formal campaign or advertisement.”

The Bud Light backlash reaffirmed my faith in America and Normal People. It really was the straw that broke Normal People’s back. During the Biden administration, we were buried in gay propaganda, and when it’s aimed at adults, who cares? But corporate America went insane, targeting children. Bud Light went insane legitimizing all this trans madness, which is either a perverted man publicly acting out a sexual fetish or someone suffering from a mental illness. Either way, normalizing this behavior crosses every decent person’s line.

Best of all, the Bud Light backlash told Normal People they were not alone in their justifiable disgust with this LGBTEWW nonsense, and corporate America, even large corporations like Target that did business with outright Satanists, were forced to listen.

One of the tricks the dominant culture (news media, Hollywood, etc.) try to pull off is to make Normal People feel outnumbered and isolated when we are actually the vast majority, the 80 in the 80/20.

Ecolab is gearing up for a Q2 earnings reveal that’s expected to land right on target, with steady pricing helping to counter softer volumes across its business segments.

What does this mean?

Known for its water, hygiene, and infection prevention solutions, Ecolab is set to report second-quarter results in line with Wall Street’s expectations on July 29. Analysts anticipate organic sales growth of about 3%, with overall volumes staying mostly flat. Segments like High Tech, Life Sciences, Institutional, and Pest control should shine, even as Industrial, Healthcare, and Specialty lag behind. The real standout is pricing power—which continues to drive 2% to 3% gains, with more upside possible as new tariff surcharges kick in later this year. Adjusted EPS is forecast at $1.89 and revenue slightly above $4.04 billion, both hovering near consensus. Investors will be watching closely for third-quarter guidance to gauge whether Ecolab can maintain this momentum into year-end.

Why should I care?

For markets: Pricing strength steadies the ship.

Even with some areas showing softer demand, Ecolab’s ability to push through higher prices highlights its resilience in a choppy market. With shares trading at $266.19 as of July 15 and RBC Capital Markets sticking to an outperform rating, the company’s blend of pricing power and margin focus gives investors reason for optimism despite a slight dip in the stock.

The bigger picture: Playing the long game in an uneven economy.

Ecolab’s game plan shows how firms can adapt as industrial demand ebbs and currencies shift. Stable pricing and careful cost control help soften the blow from weaker segments, while foreign exchange tailwinds could lift the company’s outlook. That strategy leaves Ecolab well positioned to benefit when broader market conditions improve.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3412092_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=7a1279f42c35d5e1df1ba85ddba7f231,N,,2025-07-15 14:20:31.774640

Novuna Business Finance, Société Générale, Aldermore and the UK Government’s National Wealth Fund have provided a combined £110m in senior debt facilities.

Ian Johnston, CEO at Osprey Charging, said: “We’re delighted that financial institutions are supporting the work our fantastic, dedicated team are doing.

“At Osprey, we build the charging hubs customers want – clean and secure, super-fast, easy to use and easy to pay for.

“In short, where I would choose to stop and re-charge with my family.”

The National Wealth Fund supported Osprey Charging’s growth as a way to support the ZEV mandate, and increase confidence in EV infrastructure.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: “We’re investing in Britain’s renewal, bringing our infrastructure into the 21st century, improving people’s day to day lives, and putting more money into their pockets through economic growth.”

£25m was provided by the fund, with the remainder coming from the private sector.

Lauren Pamma, head of energy and infrastructure at Aldermore, said: “We recognise that delivering the right charging infrastructure in the right places is absolutely critical to accelerating electric vehicle adoption across the UK.

“We’re proud to partner with Osprey Charging and this multi‑bank facility underlines our commitment to backing high‑quality, sustainable energy projects that deliver real benefits for drivers, businesses and local communities.”

Osprey’s charging network has an uptime of over 99%, and the firm says it will continue to target quality over quantity throughout its expansion.

SUMMARY

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK -0.25%) delivered a record-setting quarter, with total revenue surpassing $5 billion for the first time. Management emphasized the company's ongoing transformation toward a platforms-oriented business, citing the integration of commercial and product models to drive innovation and organic growth. Strategic investment in digital assets was highlighted by new stablecoin custody mandates, while adoption of its internal AI tool, Eliza, was described as nearly universal among employees and set to drive productivity into future periods. The company maintained conservative guidance on fee growth for the third quarter and the remainder of the year due to seasonality and market uncertainty, but upgraded NII outlook to high single-digit percentage gains and confirmed a 13% dividend increase, reflecting board confidence following the stress test. Robust capital return practices remain in place, with the payout ratio at 92% year to date and a plan to return approximately 100% of 2025 earnings through buybacks and dividends.

Robin Vince said, ""we don't see a ceiling"" on ROTCE targets and characterized current performance as ""early innings""

Management reaffirmed a ""very high bar"" for M&A, with a focus on organic growth and disciplined, capability-led acquisitions only if they closely align with strategic priorities.

Fee revenue guidance remains conservative due to ""A lot of external factors that we don't necessarily control."" as stated by Dermot McDonogh.

The platforms operating model is enabling agile integration of acquisitions, as the Archer deal illustrated, supporting future scalability if appropriate targets arise.

Management reported no ""negative pricing"" trends, with price levels largely flat or slightly positive across the enterprise and down about eighty percent from where it was three years ago.

Deposits and NII growth may moderate in the third quarter due to seasonal effects, particularly as Q3 is a ""tough comp."" yet confidence remains in high single-digit net interest income growth for the full year.

Segment performance was mixed, with Investment and Wealth Management experiencing net outflows and lower revenue, while other segments posted double-digit revenue and income growth.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Robin Vince: A strong performance. Earnings per share of $1.93 were up 27% year over year on a reported basis and up 28% excluding notable items. Total revenue was up 9% year over year, and for the first time, exceeded $5 billion in a quarter. In combination with expense growth of 4%, we at The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation generated another quarter of significant positive operating leverage, roughly 500 basis points on both the reported and operating basis. And in what is seasonally our strongest quarter, our pretax margin improved to 37%, and our return on tangible common equity improved to 28%. These are clear outputs from our multiyear transformation and robust indicators of BNY's potential.

Turning to page three, over the past few years, we have been laying the foundations for our future. In our January update, we outlined how BNY is well positioned to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends as we work hard to generate alpha through the continued transformation of our company. We entered 2025 with good momentum. Midway through the year, we are seeing results from our consistent execution and continuous delivery that add to our confidence for the medium to long term. Our strategy is simple but powerful: to be more for our clients by running our company better, all powered by our culture. I'll briefly touch on each.

First, our commercial model enables BNY to be more for our clients, helping them achieve their goals using the full breadth and depth of our platforms. As we mark the model's one-year anniversary, early signs point to the growing effectiveness of our commercial organization, with significant runway ahead. We achieved a second consecutive quarter of record sales. The number of multiproduct relationships continues to grow, and we continue to broaden and deepen our engagement with clients. For example, in June, we expanded our relationship with specialist active UK asset manager, LionTrust.

In addition to utilizing our data vault and middle office operating capabilities, LionTrust is fully outsourcing its trading to our buy-side trading solutions team, which delivers 24-hour global trade execution and reaches 100 markets globally across all major asset classes. Another important way for us to be more for our clients is to deliver innovative solutions to the market that come from the powerful combination of capabilities we have at BNY. As I've said before, we're not just in the product sales business; we're in the solutions delivery business. BNY enjoys a suite of highly adjacent platforms that, when delivered together, create powerful solutions for clients.

Our commercial model, combined with our platform's operating model, is intentionally designed to encourage more of this type of innovation. An example of this solutions mindset is our work to build the financial infrastructure of the future by bridging traditional and digital financial ecosystems to enable clients to unlock new capabilities securely and at scale. Early and continuous investments in our digital assets platform have positioned us to meet increasing institutional interest and adoption. Last month, Societe Generale selected BNY to act as reserve custodian for their first USD stablecoin in Europe. And last week, Ripple announced that BNY will act as primary custodian of Ripple's US stablecoin reserves.

Today, BNY is a leader in servicing the growing stablecoin market, enabling companies to create and use stablecoins by providing wide-ranging services from issuance to ongoing operations. Our advancements in the digital assets ecosystem are just one example of continual innovation, but there are many others: flexible financing and global clearing, the integration of collateral agency lending in Saudi Arabia, depository receipts in Canada, to name just a few. This is an important theme for us, not just periodic higher-profile product launches, but product-level micro innovations week by week, month by month that drive our organic growth. Next, on running our company better, with purpose.

2025 will be a milestone year for BNY's transition into our platform's operating model, which realigns how we work and organize ourselves across the entire company. As a reminder, running our company better is not just about expenses. It's about better. Yes, we are driving efficiency, but we're also enabling commercial opportunities, enhancing client journeys, and accelerating speed to market. With more than half of our people at BNY working in the model today, we remain on track to complete our phased transition into the platform's operating model by this time next year.

Already, we are starting to see the impact of this new way of working, enabling our people to launch more new solutions, deploy more code releases, and come together better than ever before to support our clients. Finally, on culture. Culture is about generating a collective will to make our company achieve its full potential, harnessing the breadth of our talent to be there for clients and to help the company. This includes so many things, but one part of that enablement is our embrace of AI. It's an exciting moment for AI at BNY. Nearly all of our employees are using our multi-agentic enter AI platform, Eliza, and we have started to introduce digital employees into our workforce.

It's early days, but we are beginning to see the benefit of some of these agents and digital employees, and we expect that to accelerate in the quarters and years ahead. To wrap up, against the backdrop of a busy operating environment, our priorities are clear, and we remain relentlessly focused on execution. BNY is showing strong momentum, and we are determined to deliver further value for our clients, our shareholders, and our people. At this midpoint of the year, we are pleased to see the initial work of our multiyear transformation bearing fruit. I'd like to thank our teams around the world for delivering strong results and for their continued commitment to the work ahead.

We have a lot of opportunity in front of us, but the strategy to unlock it is working. And with that, over to you, Dermot.

Dermot McDonogh: Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I'm starting with our consolidated financial results for the second quarter on page four of the presentation. Total revenue of $5 billion was up 9% year over year. Fee revenue was up 7%. That included 9% growth in investment services fees from our security services and marketing and wealth services segments, driven by net new business, client activity, and higher market values. Investment management and performance fees were flat. Growth from higher market values and the impact of a weaker US dollar was offset by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates that we discussed on our last earnings call.

While not on the page, I will note that firm-wide AUCA of $55.8 trillion were up 13% year over year, reflecting client inflows, higher market values, and the impact of the weaker dollar. Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 3% year over year, reflecting higher market values and the impact of the weaker dollar partially offset by cumulative net outflows. Foreign exchange revenue was up 16% year over year on the back of elevated volatility and higher volumes, partially offset by the impact of corporate treasury activity. Investment and other revenue was $184 million, including $35 million of net losses from investment security sales partially offset by favorable capital and other investments results.

Net interest income was up 17% year over year, driven by continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields as well as balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $17 million in the quarter, driven by property-specific reserve releases in our commercial real estate portfolio. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 4% year over year both on a reported basis and excluding notable items. The variance excluding notable items reflects higher investments, employee merit increases, higher revenue-related expenses, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $1.93 on a reported basis, up 27% year over year. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share were $1.94, up 28% year over year. Our pretax margin was 37% and our return on tangible common equity was 28% in the quarter. Turning to capital and liquidity on page five. At the end of June, the Federal Reserve released the results of its 2025 bank stress test, which once again underscored BNY's resilient business model and our strong balance sheet. The results also confirmed that our stress capsule buffer remains unchanged at the regulatory floor of 2.5%.

With regards to our second quarter results, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1%, down 17 basis points sequentially. The Tier 1 capital increased by $689 million, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends. Average assets increased primarily driven by deposit growth. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Over the course of the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to our common shareholders, resulting in a 92% total payout ratio year to date.

With regards to liquidity, the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 112%, down four percentage points sequentially, reflecting elevated deposit balances which were largely non-operational in early parts of the quarter. The consolidated net stable funding ratio was 131%, down one percentage point sequentially. Next, net interest income and balance sheet trends on page six. Consistent with the backdrop of elevated volatility and active trading in capital markets, we saw clients seek the strength of BNY's balance sheet and leverage our platforms for execution and settlement. Net interest income of $1.2 billion was up 17% year over year and up 4% quarter over quarter.

Both the year over year and sequential increase primarily reflect continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields as well as balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Average deposit balances grew by 6% sequentially, non-interest bearing deposits grew by 3% in the quarter, and interest-bearing deposits grew by 7%. Accordingly, average interest-earning assets increased by 6% sequentially. Cash and reverse repo balances increased by 9%, investment securities balances increased by 4%, and loans increased by 2%. Turning to our business segments starting on page seven. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.5 billion, up 10% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 10% year over year.

In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 7%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. And in issuer services, investment services fees were up 17%, driven by exceptionally strong client activity in our depository receipts business. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 22% year over year on the back of elevated volatility and higher volumes. Net interest income for the segment was up 13% year over year. Segment expenses of $1.6 billion were up 4% year over year, driven by higher investments, employee merit increases, revenue-related expenses, and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings.

Security services reported pretax income of $867 million, up 26% year over year, and a pre-tax margin of 35%. Onto Markets and Wealth Services on page eight. In our Markets and Wealth Services segment, we reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% year over year. Total investment services fees were up 9% year over year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 8%, reflecting client activity and higher market values. Net new assets were a negative $10 billion in the quarter, reflecting the deconversion of a client that was acquired by a self-clearing competitor. In clearance and collateral management, investment services fees were up 14%, driven by broad-based growth in collateral balances and clearance volumes.

And in treasury services, investment services fees were up 3%, reflecting net new business. Net interest income for the segment was up 21% year over year. Segment expenses of $897 million were up 8% year over year, driven by higher investments and litigation reserves, employee merit increases, and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our Markets and Wealth Services segment reported pre-tax income of $851 million, up 21% year over year, and a pretax margin of 49%. Turning to investment and wealth management on page nine. Our investment and wealth management segment reported total revenue of $801 million, down 2% year over year.

Investment management fees were down 1% year over year, driven by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates, partially offset by higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. Segment expenses of $653 million were down 2% year over year, driven by lower revenue-related expenses and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher severance expense and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar. Investment and wealth management reported pretax income of $148 million, down 1% year over year, and a pre-tax margin of 19%. As I described earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 3% year over year.

In the second quarter, we saw $17 billion of net outflows driven by index multi-asset and equity strategies, partially offset by net inflows into cash and fixed income strategies. Wealth management client assets of $339 billion increased by 10% year over year, largely driven by higher market values. Page ten shows the results of the other segment. For this segment, I'll just note that the sequential decrease in revenue primarily reflects the net losses from investment securities activity I mentioned earlier, while the sequential decrease in expenses reflects lower litigation reserves and severance. Turning to page eleven, I'll close with a midyear update of the financial outlook for 2025 that we provided on our earnings call in January.

As you can see on the slide, BNY is entering the second half of the year with great momentum amid elevated geopolitical and policy uncertainty. Based on where we sit today, looking out to the balance of the year, we now expect full-year 2025 net interest income to be up high single-digit percentage points year over year. And we continue to expect solid fee revenue growth in 2025, of course, market dependent. We now expect expenses excluding notable items for the year to be up approximately 3% year over year. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be in the 22% to 23% range.

Considering our 21% tax rate in the first half, that means approximately 23% for the second half of the year. And we continue to expect to return roughly 100% plus or minus of 2025 earnings through common dividends and buybacks. Following the release of the Federal Reserve's annual bank stress test, our Board of Directors declared a 13% increase of our quarterly common stock dividend, and we plan to continue repurchasing common shares under our existing share repurchase program. As always, we consider macroeconomic and interest rate environments, balance sheet growth, and many other factors with a conservative bias in managing the pace of our buybacks.

To wrap up, BNY posted very strong results, demonstrating the impact of consistent execution and delivery amid a complex but yet for BNY constructive operating environment. Momentum of our multiyear transformation continues to build, and progress to date gives us incremental confidence in BNY's great potential for the medium and long term.

Operator: And one related follow-up question. We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Ebrahim Poonawala: Thanks. Good morning.

Dermot McDonogh: Morning, Ebrahim.

Ebrahim Poonawala: Maybe, Robin, for you, I saw the call in terms of the transformation efforts, digital assets, AI just sounds like significant runway on all things organic. But address for us how you're thinking about capital deployment relative to where the stock's trading at today, and I'm sure this is not news to you in terms of news around BNY pursuing a merger with a competitor. Your interview in Barron. So give us a sense of when we think about capital deployment as shareholders, how should we think what the priority is outside of funding the business? Be it buybacks versus M&A? Thanks.

Robin Vince: Sure. So look, you know, the beginning point of what you said is actually the most important thing. We have got strong momentum. We really see the pathway to be able to generate value over the medium and long term. Obviously, you're seeing some of the early signs of that, and we're pleased with it. And that is our biggest focus because at the end of the day, the top of the capital waterfall is that ability to invest in the business. Now look. The good news is that we're a pretty capital-light business. You can see it in the 28% ROTCE that we generated in the quarter. We're pleased with that.

That's another sign of the transition and transformation of the company towards this more platforms orientation because that is the sort of feature that you'd expect of a company in terms of the direction of travel that we've got going. Now in terms of the sort of the inorganic stuff, look, our broad approach hasn't changed, which is M&A done well can be a powerful tool in the toolkit. It's not accustomed to comment on any specific rumor or speculation, but I think we demonstrated last year with the Archer acquisition that we've got the ability to make M&A work for us in a sensible way. Having said that, I just really want to underscore this point.

It's a very high bar for us for M&A, especially a larger transaction. It would have to make a ton of sense. We'd need to have a lot of conviction and execution. We're focused on ongoing alignment with our strategic priorities. Strong cultural fit matters, and, of course, the financials really have to work. And our M&A story is a two-sided story as well because you saw that last year. We bought Archer, but we sold our corporate trust Canada business. So the punchline I'll leave you with is we are focused on our organic growth. That is working. We are beginning the process of a multiyear journey on that.

And we're going to be open because we should be open to sensible things inorganically if they make sense, but I'll underline again if they make sense.

Ebrahim Poonawala: That's very clear. Thank you. And I guess maybe just following up on that. You referenced the 27% ROTC this quarter. I get it's a seasonally strong quarter. But as we think about again relative to new investors trying to put money to work in the stock, if, structurally, based on all the work you've done so far over the last few years, and where things are going, is it safe for investors, shareholders, the street to assume that this is becoming a high twenties low C institution, which should then support a very different multiple than we've been used to for the last several years. Thanks.

Robin Vince: So look, I'll blend sort of two things together here. One is the broader medium-term targets as we think about them. We have not put a ceiling on any of our medium-term targets. We viewed them as milestones on a longer journey. At the time that we first communicated them, you know, people understandably thought about them as ambitious based on where we had been in the past. But we are on a journey here, and we are making important steps forward. And so on ROTCE specifically, we don't see a ceiling on that number.

Because as a more platforms-oriented company, remember, NII is only 25% of our revenues, view that as broadly for the balance sheet, which means three-quarters of our business is largely a pretty capital-light business. That's driving forward in terms of fee growth. And so I would just look generally at our medium-term targets. I would throw ROTCE, your question, into that as well. And say, we have a lot of ambition. We think we're relatively early in our journey. And we're absolutely going to be moving the bar higher on ourselves, which frankly we do every single day in terms of how we run the company.

Ebrahim Poonawala: Perfect. Thank you, Robert.

Robin Vince: Thanks. We'll move to our next question from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.

Ken Usdin: Hey. Good morning, everyone.

Dermot McDonogh: I wanted to ask about just the evolution of, as the year goes on, of just overall top of the house performance. Because, obviously, you're taking up your NII guy, but NII is only 25% of revenues. And while the cost guide is up, I think it maybe misses the point that on the fee side, your guide is only just for year over year, and here we are plus 6% in the second quarter and plus 7% for the year to date. So I'm just wondering on the fee side, are fees better than your original expectations too?

And is that informing as much as the NII upside, you know, the slight drip up on the overall cost guide as the total is coming in better?

Dermot McDonogh: Hey, Ken. Ken, I'll start with that. Look, the way I kind of think about the firm is I start with overall positive operating leverage. And I guess a key message I would leave you there both on operating and reported basis I think it was roughly 500 basis points of operating leverage. And so since Robin took over as CEO, we've kind of made the positive operating leverage our North Star. And so consistently delivering that to the market has been our kind of core strategy around how we think about the financials. So you have three components to that. You've got fees. You've got NII, and you've got expenses.

And you'll see from the financial yeah, revenue up 9%, expenses up 4%, you know, delivering that positive operating leverage within the revenue. You've got fees. You've got NII, really solid performance on NII, which gives us comfort around for the balance of the year. Giving a higher guide to kind of high single digits. And on the revenue side, I think the strength in fees really underscores the commercial model that we launched about a year ago two consecutive quarters of kind of record sales, notwithstanding that, the second quarter is a seasonally strong quarter, so we would expect strong fee strong sales. But that was on the back of a Q1.

And we see going into Q3, although it is a kind of seasonally slower quarter for us, given the vacations, etcetera, we see kind of strong momentum continuing. So you see a picture on page three of the midyear update. Where we kind of show you a little pictorial about how we think about organic growth, and we have high conviction around that beginning to build and grow.

Robin Vince: And, Ken, let me just build on a couple of things that Dermot said. So first of all, yes, it was a constructive environment in the second quarter, but I'll bring you back to our comments in January when we talked about the various different things that drive our business. We've been intentionally been repositioning the company gradually to be able to take advantage of more different types of environment.

So I think the punchline is, well, there are always amazing environments that you could have for a business or potentially environments which just don't have any element of being particularly constructive we think we're broadening out the probabilities of any given environment as actually working reasonably well for us because equity markets up fixed income market's up, equity volume's up, fixed income volumes up, transaction volumes and GDP up, issuance up, asset management activity, wealth management activity. There are a lot of cylinders in this particular engine. And so the second quarter was constructive, but we have been positioning the company to be able to take advantage of more and more environment as constructive.

And I think that plus the point that Dermott made around our commercial model, is allowing us to grind organic growth higher. So we want to take advantage of the beta. We want to be able to participate in whatever the quarter happens to bring, but this constant focus on alpha generation in terms of how we're running the company and positioning the company is an important part of the story. And we do think that this is a quarter where you're starting to see that but, again, the early innings point that Dermot and I have made many times before there's a lot of runway here in our estimation.

Ken Usdin: Understood. That's great color, and I do like that upper right chart on page three. Just one thing on the environment then. Can you've talked previously about just the stickiness of deposits and obviously that's informing the better than expected NII outlook. Does anything change in the environment to that point? Because I think Robin will bring back in your point about, like, you know, tools in the kit and arsenal to just continue to add deposits, but maybe you can just help us understand the environment.

Dermot McDonogh: So I think point number one here that I would make Ken, is as a matter of strategy, we don't really lead with deposits. So when you see deposits being a little bit higher, the mix of IB and IB a little bit higher, it really speaks to the breadth and the depth of the franchise and doing more with clients. And doing more with clients kind of attracts deposits.

And specifically around second quarter, in our corporate trust business, we had higher levels of activity, and we were able to kind of help clients with unique specific situations that attracted deposits into the system particularly on the NIB side, and that was able for us to kind of have a good NII print this quarter. And when we look out for the balance of the year and run our various scenarios, we really have reduced the tails with respect to interest rates sensitivity, and that was really on the back of a ton of work done towards the back end of last year when the Fed made the pivot after Jackson Hole around the forward rate curve.

And so that gives us now a lot of confidence to be able to kind of provide that higher NII growth against what is a constructive backdrop for us.

Ken Usdin: Thanks very much, guys.

Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.

Glenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much.

Robin Vince: With so much going well, forgive me, I'm going to

Glenn Schorr: pick on the one area that wasn't as good as everything else in investment management. So fees down a little bit. Flows out, margins down, you know, in that nineteen range. So despite the good market. So the question is, if we step back a little bit, we talk can we talk a little bit about what investments you're making to improve the business and, like, what's high on your to do list to help you know, drive better performance as we move forward in investment management? Thanks.

Dermot McDonogh: Thanks for the question, Glenn. I would say investment number one was Robin appointing Jose as the leader of that business, and he started last September. And you can see, you know, between first quarter where we had a margin of eight percent to this quarter where we're about nineteen percent, you can see that step up in margin, and you can see Jose is beginning to work the opportunity and making some decisions to right size it from an efficiency standpoint and, I'm very pleased with what Jose has done.

What I what I also think he's doing very, very effectively and, look, both Robin and myself will have talked about this on prior quarters, the one BNY approach in terms of de-siloing the firm you kind of have to go that extra mile as it relates to our investment and wealth management strategy and bringing the boutique closer to the firm. And I think Jose sees a lot of opportunity for us to cross sell within the firm, both within our asset servicing business and within our Pershing business.

So bringing the strength of our manufacturing capabilities to our Pershing clients and our asset servicing clients is a kind of a key forward strategy that we can see we can do well at. And also bringing in leadership and product development. So think you're going to see more positive stories coming from this particular segment, whereas as with all transformations, it takes a little bit time, and Jose is getting that time to make the decisions that he needs to. And, Glenn, let me just build on one particular point that Derma just made. You know, one of Jose's early

Robin Vince: observations about the business was we have a terrific to use Dermot's term, manufacturing base If you look under the hood of our $2.1 trillion of AUM, you have some real market leading franchises. We have Insight, which is number one in its market. That's a trillion dollars of it right there. You have Walter Scott, which is terrific, long only, long dated, equity manager. You have a terrific business in the form of Dreyfus, money markets. And we have a in Mellon, a direct indexer that's capable of being able to create product that are asset servicing clients are very interested in.

Obviously, it also has a lot of relevance for the $3 trillion of wealth distribution that we have in Pershing. So you think about the manufacturing base, let's give ourselves a check that we have a pretty good set of businesses that are actually performing pretty well. On the distribution, if we didn't have BNY, then you could look at asset management, and you could say there are a lot of parallels with other midsized to large asset managers, and the question of wow. This investment manager it at BNY is the one of the reasons why I joined BNY. Because there's all of this distribution potential, but we just haven't fully unlocked it. Okay.

So then what sits in the middle? And that's the word that Dermat used product, where if you if you take a metaphor for this for a second, imagine that you were a Coke or a Pepsi and you were making a beverage and you had to concentrate and you have all of this terrific distribution because you can sell in restaurants, you can sell in grocery stores, you can sell in a corner store as well. But in the middle of that is a critical point of product, which is, are you taking the manufacturing base that you have and making cans when you want to sell it in the corner store.

Because if you put bottles of concentrate in the corner store, it's not going to help you. But when you're delivering to a large fast food outlet, there you want to be able to deliver the concentrate Canned is not as useful. So this piece in the middle, this product shaping, that leverages the manufacturing base with an eye the distribution channels that you have available to you is critical and I think we haven't done as good a job on that as we could. And so that's a very big focus for us, and we think that when you take all of those things together, we think there's an interesting pathway here.

Glenn Schorr: Thanks for all that.

Glenn Schorr: Maybe I could do a tiny follow-up on previous question. And forgive me if you said it, but the fee revenue were up 5% for the first half and the guide is still, quote, up on the year. Markets are higher. Despite this investment management, it feels like deliberately conservative which I'm cool with. I just curious on how we square the up five for the first half. Markets are trending well. Your momentum's good. Why wouldn't the fee outlook be better? I know I asked you that last quarter and you outperformed.

Dermot McDonogh: So the way I would answer it is it's like, there are a lot of factors that go into the fee. A lot of external factors that we don't necessarily control. Control, very market dependence, we kind of go back to the foundational building blocks of the platform operating model and the commercial model, which is, you know, it's still only a year old, but it is working. You can see it. Have higher conviction about our ability to drive organic fee growth from here

Glenn Schorr: But

Dermot McDonogh: you know and we've changed a lot over the last three years, Glenn, about the transparency of our numbers and how we give you a lot more than we did three years ago. So I think as we get more conviction and as we get more kind of sales telemetry around us, we'll give you more guidance as we feel comfortable But for now, I think the momentum is there. The upper trajectory is there, but we're not ready to yet guide on specific around fees. And third quarter is usually a seasonally slower quarter, and Q2 is a seasonally strong quarter. So it's important to be balanced in that as well.

Glenn Schorr: Fair enough. Thanks for all that.

Robin Vince: Thanks, Glenn.

Operator: We'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Graseck: Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning, Robin. Good morning, Dermot. Good morning, Ben. I wanted to dig

Betsy Graseck: I wanted to dig in a little bit on the AI commentary that you had, Robin. And starting off,

Betsy Graseck: the operating leverage is just so strong almost double what consensus had baked in for you and really terrific results here. I wanted to understand your comments on AI as it relates to the forward look because you indicated that nearly all your employees are using the Eliza, you know, AI platform. And you're starting to you're beginning to see the benefit of this. I mean, is it the benefit from AI at a level that we can see in these operating leverage results And maybe you could help us understand, is this more revenues or expenses?

Robin Vince: Sure. Well, thanks for your comments about positive operating leverage as Dermot and I both said over time Betsy, that is a great North Star. And going back to Glenn's question at the end, there, you know, one of the reasons why we've been always a little reluctant to guide on all of the elements underneath the hood of positive operating leverage is we recognize the composition in any quarter or any year could be a little different, and we don't want to create ceilings for ourselves. Positive operating leverage, and we see a ton of pathway.

And when you when you go under the hood, one of the reasons why over the past three years, we've really focused on showing you all the inputs to what we're doing is because we recognize that the timing of exact when each of these strategies starts to really hit varies a little bit. And so we've got several things driving the positive operating leverage. We've got a commercial engine which is starting to now make a meaningful contribution. Output evidence, you can see it in the record sales quarters that we had in the first and second quarter. The platform's operating model, we knew there would be a longer lead time to that.

We started work on it three years ago, and now it's starting to come into own, but it's still very early days because only less than ten percent of our people have been in the model for at least a year. And as we indicated, in our prepared remarks, we see the actual value really starting to shine through in platforms operating model after we've had people in the model for about that period of time. So that is still to come, little bit of it now, most of it twenty six, twenty seven, twenty eight, and beyond. The next layer is heart of your question, which is AI.

We view AI as a top line story, and an expense story in because what we're really doing is we're unlocking capacity in the company, and we want to then be able to use that capacity to do other higher value things. That's why we've been encouraging all of our people to participate in AI because we view our AI solutions, which we put on the page three again, demonstrating the inputs today and then we'll show you the outputs over time.

We see those as being able to be very helpful as two will be our digital employees as essentially companions and leverage for our people to be able to go faster and create capacity for themselves they can they can reinvest in doing new things, pushing forward with clients, more time in the day, all of the above. So the our excitement about AI is a very medium to long term excitement but we've invested heavily early on in the psychology of it in the company so that we have AI for everyone everywhere, for everything. And that's really how we think about AI. So it's early days. There's not a ton in the P&L right now.

To your point with net investment, but we are starting to see the early signs of what we think will be an acceleration twenty six, twenty seven, twenty eight, twenty nine, beyond.

Betsy Graseck: Thank you.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Mike Mayo: Hi. No good deed goes unpunished. I know you talked about

Robin Vince: organic growth and You could you could make that you could make that one of your punch lines, Mike.

Mike Mayo: You could I know you've trademarked the world's worst oligopoly, but that one you could put it could put in trademark as well. And BNY not your parents' bank? Look. I'm the first to say you've optimized much better than I had expected these last two years. And, but yeah. And you have these very high returns as

Mike Mayo: but the organic growth And you do it correctly x markets, x currency, x deals,

Mike Mayo: whether it's two percent or three percent, is still not great in the scheme of, you know, the overall world. And, I know you want that growth to be better. And I know you said you had record sales, but it's

Mike Mayo: the growth is still the growth. It hasn't changed that much at an organic level. And I know you guys have thought about this, but know, to the degree you sacrifice the high very high returns, reinvest for better growth, than what the company's had so fast. Five, ten, twenty years. Right? And so I where do you stand in that trade off? Of maybe having lower returns or maybe

Mike Mayo: know,

Mike Mayo: not raising your return targets and reinvesting more for growth And where should that organic growth be in your perfect world the way you define it?

Robin Vince: Sure. So several things here, Mike. So one of the reasons why we put that chart, the top right corner of page three, was to illustrate the fact that organic growth has been growing. I hear your point about three versus two, but three is still fifty percent more than two. And significantly up from where it has been in the past. But a few other points to note. Our growth in the past generally has been quite subject to markets. And so we are very happy to take advantage of constructive backdrops.

And as I answered in a prior question, we're trying to position the company to take advantage of more types of backdrops so that we can we can be less handed our results by the market conditions and more in charge our own destiny. That's a very deliberate strategy, and we feel like we're making some progress on that. So that's sort of observe the next observation. The next thing under the hood is what are the prerequisites for the real type of organic growth that you're talking about that you've challenged us on understandably and rightly so over the course of the past two or three years.

And this is where we really feel like we've set the table for the future. And to your point about how we think about investing versus harvesting, we've been very clear on this. We are taking a decade view of the transformation of BNY, and we're pleased where we are close to three years in, but we are far from done because much of what we have done has actually been investing for the future, and we're in the very early stages of seeing that being harvested. We talked about the commercial model. We talked about the platform's operating model. We talked about AI, which is part of the growth story as well as it is on the expenses.

But let me just come back to the key elements of what we've got. We've got a diversified set of platforms. That is, yes, helping us to be more diversified in different environments, but it is also allowing us to better position to capitalize on these market trends and to generate alpha because it's less one business going to market at by itself. It's more what's the synergy between the component parts.

You know, a client who custody these with us who also does treasury clearing with us, who also does collateral management, with us is going to be able to get better outcomes over time because of the fact that all of those things can just be book entry for us within our ecosystem. That allows us to move to 24-hour. That allows us to think an embraced digital assets maybe in a different way than somebody else can. And you're starting to see the early signs of these platforms coming together to show something where the sum is more than the individual parts, and that's what our commercial model is actually about.

So we're investing in these micro innovations, the bigger things, the synergies between the platforms. We've positioned people behind this. We've positioned culture behind this, and we're organizing the company behind this. And we think it is starting to show, but we absolutely agree with you that they should be more a lot more gas in the tank here.

Dermot McDonogh: Hey, Mike. I would add just a couple of more points as well.

Mike Mayo: One is, you know, you ask the question sometimes about

Dermot McDonogh: negative pricing. We just we haven't seen it this quarter, which really kind of goes to the efficiency point about us being able to reduce our cost to serve, which is able to help us drive the organic growth because we're able to compete more effectively to win our share of business. So that would be point number one. Point number two, to Robin's points about the commercial model, now we're in the early stages of a of a product model. Which is joining with the commercial model, and that's been led by Carolyn Weinberg, where she's able to see in between the scenes of our various businesses to create new products that clients want.

So lots of opportunity to come there And the third point I would make is when you look at the firm overall and you have to think about the enterprise, it's a 37% pretax margin. Diversified business model. And so when you look at IWM, which is now hovering around the 19%, it's upside from here for their enterprise as we resume that path towards 25% which is going to further fuel organic growth at the enterprise level.

Mike Mayo: And I guess just one more follow-up on the

Mike Mayo: talk about acquisitions, and I heard you, it can be a powerful tool if it made sense. You're not going to do anything stupid. I hear you. As you've gone and the art of what's possible. Since you are talking about a different type of not your parents' BNY because you are more diverse in terms of your offerings. What's the realm of possibilities for acquisition? Clearly, traditional trust

Mike Mayo: you know,

Mike Mayo: businesses or sub businesses are always possible. Going back to the merger, the big merger. But what other areas would you consider maybe buying?

Robin Vince: So it's it's it's an important question, Mike. Again, you know, focus our primary focus is on driving the growth And but there are many different pathways on this thing. So we you know, two or three years ago, we said there's absolutely no way that we're going to make any acquisitions. Then we sort of warmed up to the idea of capability buys, which is how I would frame Archer. And that really does check the box of helping us to go faster, to derisk because we could buy versus having to build ourselves. And we're seeing the early signs of that output. Great client feedback. The integration's been going well. New client wins as a result of it.

So I still think that is the most likely path for us when it comes to M&A helping us to go faster? And I'm going to guess, but it doesn't have to be this way. That those types of things are generally more likely to be in the bits of the business which are a little bit more platform like. Although it's interesting that Archer was a buy once use across the firm type of acquisition. So that's our that's our expectation for the primary focus. Because the bar for larger transactions is super high, we'd have to have a lot of conviction in the execution of something like that because clearly they could be quite complicated.

And there, you could you could make a case elsewhere in some of the other segments that maybe there would be the opportunity to have even more scale. Because if you're a scale player, and you've got a platforms operating model like organization, the thesis would be that you could bolt on more activity onto your existing chassis, and there would be a lot of scalability associated with that. So that's a fine thesis and something that we certainly keep in mind. As well.

But, you know, as now we have close to two-thirds of the of the company in platform like businesses either in MWS or in our issuer services business, you know, when you look at MWS alone, it's a 49% margin. You know, we've got we've got choices in this space. But we're not going to let those choices get distracting for us. We are focused on building our company, to your favorite term, the organic way, and then we'll just be opportunistic and disciplined on external related stuff.

Mike Mayo: Message heard. Thank you.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

Alex Blostein: Thank you. Good morning for the question. Thank you.

Alex Blostein: Busy morning. So I had a couple of questions for you guys around the new business, upper opportunities. I know you mentioned a couple things around the digit digital assets and just kind of tokenized environment, which obviously continues to be quite dynamic. Was hoping you could build on that a little more. Obviously, there's a lot of you know, debates in the financial services industry today, perhaps more so on the stock than the past in terms of what's a risk versus what's an opportunity.

So when you think about where BNY sits in that in that realm, where do you see both risk to, you know, the existing business and some of the new revenue opportunities that could come out of this?

Robin Vince: Sure. Thanks, Alex. Look, net, we see these advancements providing more opportunities than risks, but you're right. There are things on both sides of the ledger If you just go back and just think about industries and big changes in technology that happen over time, they create disruption. And what disruption does is it allows for a little bit of a reorganization sometimes of the ecosystem. And it's our observation that companies that have a lot of forward thinking innovation that push forward take advantage of that as opposed to sticking their heads in the sand, tend to be tend to be winners.

Now we have many specific valuable attributes that help us make us a great partner to these digital assets firms. And that's one of the reasons why we've been so engaged in the space for several years because initially, it had been about providing our traditional banking services to those digital asset companies. We serve many of them. With our traditional banking services. Then it's been about helping with the on ramps, off ramps between that traditional banking world and the on chain world And in the future, we think it's also going to be about more activity on chain. We are live with Bitcoin custody today.

We do it natively, and we can help clients There's more stuff in the world. We want to we're in the business of looking after stuff as one of our businesses, and we're happy to do that. But we're also in the payments business. Again, there's synergy between our platforms. We're also in the issuer services corporate trustee business. They're synergy. We're in the NAV business. That's relevant. Synergy. Distribution business, relevant. Money market fund business, relevant. And so when you take all of these things together, we're a terrific partner for some of these clients because we can do a lot of different things with a trusted brand that actually helps them to feel to feel good.

So, look, Stablecoins particularly, it's obviously one of the topics of the day, and we're very active in that space. And that's the reason why we mentioned a couple of those recent examples, but there are many more in our prepared remarks. But, Alex, what I would say is don't lose also that's all great stuff, but don't lose sight

Alex Blostein: of our core businesses that are market leading

Dermot McDonogh: that are growing share, because the market is growing. So growing the pie with existing clients in our core businesses is also happening and very important.

Alex Blostein: Yep. That's totally fair. Demi, we want for you on just the balance sheet dynamic and deposits. You know, I know you mentioned you guys don't lead with deposits. That'll that'll make sense. But when we look at the trajectory deposit base for the last couple of quarters, obviously much more stable, and nice to see the noninterest bearing deposits improving here as well. So as you look out into the back half and ultimately, you know, where we are in July, maybe give us sense where interest deposits in particular sit And as we think about the forward, which businesses tend to drive those for you guys as sort of think about the trajectory beyond twenty five?

Dermot McDonogh: So it was a strong quarter. I expect the balances to moderate into Q3. You might remember Q3 of last year was a strong quarter for us in terms of NII So Q3 is a tough comp. So and deposits we expect to moderate at the seasonal slowdown. And so the diversity of the NIB across the franchise is particularly pleasing. But corporate trust is a highlight. And because of the breadth and the depth and the market shares that we have in that business, we do attract a lot of cash into the system by virtue of increased client activity. So Corporate Trust in Q2 was a notable highlight particularly around escrow as a result of increased M&A activity.

So but I would expect that to moderate a little bit in Q3 and pick up again in Q4 But overall, I feel pretty convicted around the high mid single digits NII growth for the year?

Alex Blostein: Alrighty. Thanks so much.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bedell: Oh, great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe two separate questions on the

Alex Blostein: platforms operating model. So first one, maybe for you, Dermid. Focusing on the cost reduction element as we've, you know, we have another fifty percent to migrate over the next call it, twelve months. And I know, obviously, expense guidance went up a little bit, which makes complete sense given the, you know, stronger revenue growth environment and all the dynamic budgeting aspect that you've talked about. But on the cost reduction side from that conversion on the platform's operating model, and how should we think about framing that as a know, as a positive contributor to the expense story for the rest of this year in twenty six?

Dermot McDonogh: So I do go back to a little bit, Brian, what Robin said

Dermot McDonogh: earlier about you know, fifty percent of the people are in the model We've done three waves over the last fifteen months. The maturity level between wave one and wave three is quite stark. And what the wave one businesses that went into the model are doing now in terms of one BNY connectivity, automation, you know, dynamic innovation, having an entrepreneurial spirit within their own businesses it's it's gives me a great sense of pride to actually see it day in, day out. And while your question led with the cost reduction, we really think about it internally about running the company better and creating capacity.

And we either deploy that capacity into new investments, new opportunities, or we let it flow through to positive operating leverage. And you can see in Q2 of this year, we kind of gave you gave the market 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. And the platform operating model was a continue was a was a contributor to that. So with fifty percent of the firm in the model and ten percent in it

Brian Bedell: about fifteen months, I would expect the maturity of this

Dermot McDonogh: to kind of give us a benefit for the next few years. And so it's not for another two years where I would say the firm will be reasonably mature in the model. And it's creating its own flywheel of momentum and innovation. And when you overlay that with maturity of the commercial model and you overlay that again with what Caroline is doing on the product side, you're going to see the North Star of positive operating leverage be delivered for this for the foreseeable future. So I'd like, it's all about running the company better, and I don't talk internally about expenses or cost reduction. Yep. Okay. And then that's great. And then maybe just also on

Brian Bedell: following question on the on the on the platform's operating model. As you think about M&A, maybe just

Brian Bedell: your thoughts around how much the operating model, you know, the platforms operating model you know, kind of informs your decision about what type of M&A to

Brian Bedell: to do? Is it a main is it a major or a primary factor in bringing on businesses that you think can fit into that model and therefore you can scale them in organically. And then I guess is it even possible to do large scale

Brian Bedell: M&A

Brian Bedell: and, you know, integrate that into this platform? Or do you see know, too many disparities with other know, large providers that would make that difficult?

Robin Vince: Yeah. It's it's an important question. So look, broadly in the platform's operating model, Dermott touched on the fact that it's a two-sided thing because we're very much looking for it to drive revenue. This interlock between platforms operating model and the commercial model is super important because by having defined our product and client platforms in the way that we have, And then by layering over that, a new go to market approach with our commercial model, that's just allowing us to go faster collaborate more across the platforms, create more solutions, and really create a lot of empowerment to our teams to go and listen to clients invent new stuff, provide more solutions to them.

And, of course, that and just running the company better, more broadly, as Dermot mentioned, those are the reasons why we are doing this. Now it has a nice byproduct, which is it organizes ourselves in a way where our chassis is super well organized and very strong, and we clearly see the benefits of that across the board as we continue to go through the model. And so I think what that will result in is when we talk about some type of bolt on acquisition and almost irrespective of its size.

If it's sort of adding to us in something that we broadly do today or something that essentially speeds us forward in something that we do today, we're able to add it with really without having to take on all of the expenses associated with us because it sort of becomes a bolt on to a chassis that we have. You could

Mike Mayo: see that with Archer as a good example, which is

Robin Vince: they are able to do more of what they want to do because they're able to tap in to the right additional parts of BNY. They client onboarding capabilities that our client onboarding platform provides to Archer in its acquisition of new clients allows them to go faster. The fact that we've able been able to wrap our technology and our AI around that is going to allow them to do more things.

And so there's a real you're able to actually achieve an economy of scale and actually add scale to a scale business or go faster in a business where you're adding capability where sometimes that's a theoretical conversation because you look at something and you say, oh, well, you could just you're pretty scaled. You could just add more stuff and it'll scale. But that's not true if you're adding a complicated back end you know, trying to smash two incompatible things together. And I think that was a lesson that this company learned twenty years ago with the acquisition between or the merger between Mellon and BNY. That was not consolidated properly.

So the punchline is the platform's operating model allows us to have a clarity of chassis that I think actually will allow for higher quality integrations in the future if ever we choose to do one.

Brian Bedell: Yep. Great color. Thank you.

Dermot McDonogh: Yeah.

Operator: We'll take our next take our next question. David Smith with Truist Securities.

David Smith: Good morning.

David Smith: So you're pretty clear that, you know, you see further upside on returns and margin from here even with the strong results you've had in this quarter in the first half? Are there areas right now that you feel like you're over earning Or would you say that you know, you're looking to hold or improve profitability across the firm, from these levels right now?

Dermot McDonogh: I would say it's a good question, David. How I would answer that is we're trying to get better every day in every business and a mindset I adopt with everybody that I work with and talk to is one percent improvement every day, be better, run the company better, Always be humble. It's all about the client, if you keep the client happy, gonna win more business. And that really is, I think, our secret sauce I talked to a couple of people this week who've been at the firm last a long time, and I said, what's the difference between BNY today and BNY of ten years ago? And in a word, it was about client centricity.

And so we're very focused on putting the client at the heart of everything that we do. And so I wouldn't say that any one business we feel like we've meet we've reached max potential because we've invested in a lot. If you kind of take corporate trust two or three years ago, that was that was a well that was a high performing business from a margin standpoint, but had been neglected for a long time with respect to investments because the margin was good. But now we've kind of decided to invest in the business, and we're growing share. We're doing it at a higher margin than we did before. We're using AI.

We have better employee NPS scores. So all in the round, the strategy is working when you look at the three strategic pillars for that particular business. Looked at it objectively three years ago, you would say nothing to do there. We felt like there was a lot to do, and we're making great progress.

Robin Vince: David, let me add a couple of things because this your question go is some one of these things that we debate quite a bit internally as a team, and it goes back actually to the very earliest days of us re underwriting our strategy. At the time, you might remember us saying this, we looked back over the industry, for instance, on annual operating and we say, what does great look like? What are the what are the two best performers in the prior decade from twenty twelve to twenty two? On positive operating leverage and what actually is that number?

And the answer well, it was a hundred and fifty basis points of positive operating leverage on average over the course of that decade. So we said, okay. Well, we think we can be best in class. We think we've got the businesses to do it. Let's shoot for that. And, you know, lo and behold, we've sort of blown that out of the water in twenty three and twenty four and also in the first half of twenty five. So it begs the question to ourselves about are we over earning? How does the environment fit into this? And then we realized, of course, well, we keep talking about being a platforms operating company.

We have these great set of businesses, We don't actually think that banks are our pure comp. We think that there's also a comp out there with other platforms companies and other financial services platforms company who don't happen to exist in bank form. And so when you start to look at the world through those lenses, suddenly, ROTCE you can see a pathway to bigger numbers, and you can see a path to bigger numbers on margin. And we look at those types of comps, and we say, okay. Let us not be satisfied with what we originally thought of as maybe the way that we think about positive operating leverage it's okay to push harder.

Having said that, we're constantly want to be able to invest. And so to Dermot's point, we're not going to let a pursuit of positive operating leverage cause us somehow to underinvest in the business. We are investing with a decade view first and foremost. But I think it does go to one of the earlier questions, and your point also about our vent ceilings So I'm sure there will be, but we're not allowing ourselves including not being lulled into a sense of security by achieving our medium term outlooks and targets, we're not allowing ourselves to think about any ceilings across the business.

David Smith: So just to push you a little bit on that,

David Smith: know, if you're not putting any ceilings or, you know, capping your

David Smith: yourself on growth on expenses in order to achieve positive operating leverage, you know, why not invest a little bit more than just three percent expense growth you know, given the strong backdrop you're seeing and strong performance you've shown so far in the first half?

Robin Vince: No. It's it's a good push, and we do challenge ourselves on that question. I think, you know, you if you were in our sort of weekly syncs on these types of topics internally, you'd hit Dermot on a regular basis going out to the various different businesses and platforms and say, tell me what you need to invest. Do you need more investment and more expense allocation in order to be able to help you to go faster? And so that is a constant push that we are giving to the businesses. Now having said that, we are mindful of the fact that some of what we do is also dictated by the environment.

Maybe less and less over time, but it's clearly is still a meaningful backdrop for us. And so we are naturally a little bit conservative in terms of how we think about the year going into it. Because if, for instance, we'd had a much, much tougher backdrop which would not have been impossible in the quarter when you think about what was happening in April, and all of the sort of uncertainties that were in April. We wouldn't have felt comfortable necessarily if we'd had a more negative environment growing our expense guide.

So there's there's a certain amount of agility as opposed to going into the year assuming everything's going to be perfect betting on a big expense number and then getting disappointed. That's the old version of BNY Mellon. That's not the BNY of today.

Dermot McDonogh: Financial discipline is a very important skill and must memory that we've developed over the last few years. And we like to think that you have given us some credibility for that. It's not our desire to lose that. So financial discipline is very important to us.

David Smith: Alright. Thank you.

Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhathiya with Morningstar.

Rajiv Bhathia: Great. Good morning. I just want to follow-up on your remark that you're not seeing negative pricing. Should I interpret that as pricing being flat year over year is that on a consolidated basis? So are you seeing the pricing environment differ by LOB?

Dermot McDonogh: So I would it's broadly flat across the firm. And significantly improved from three years ago where I would say it was a headwind few years ago. And I think as a result of all the strategies and that we initiatives that we talked to you about and that we've talked about today, I would say repricing, if I was to give you a stat, is roughly down about eighty percent from where it was three years ago. And so overall at the enterprise level, it's flat to slightly positive this year so far.

Rajiv Bhathia: And does it differ by, like, LOB?

Dermot McDonogh: Not really. No. Not there's no standout really by LOB. I would say it's broadly consistent.

Rajiv Bhathia: Thank you.

Operator: And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks.

Robin Vince: Thank you, operator, and thanks everybody for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team.

According to Medtronic, LigaSure seals vessels within two seconds and minimises thermal spread to surrounding tissue.
Medtronic senior vice-president Matt Anderson said: “With CE mark for LigaSure RAS, Medtronic is fulfilling a promise to customers to integrate our trusted vessel-sealing technology onto the Hugo RAS system.
With its da Vinci surgical robot, Intuitive Surgical currently holds the largest share of the global robotic surgery market at almost 60%, according to GlobalData analysis.
""Medtronic’s Hugo robot wins CE mark for vessel-sealing technology"" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.","Medtronic has secured EU CE mark approval for LigaSure RAS, a vessel-sealing instrument for use with the company’s Hugo robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system.

LigaSure is indicated for sealing and cutting vessels, thick tissue, and lymphatics up to 7mm in diameter and expands Hugo’s capabilities in areas such as gynaecologic and urologic procedures. According to Medtronic, LigaSure seals vessels within two seconds and minimises thermal spread to surrounding tissue.

Medtronic senior vice-president Matt Anderson said: “With CE mark for LigaSure RAS, Medtronic is fulfilling a promise to customers to integrate our trusted vessel-sealing technology onto the Hugo RAS system.

“More than fulfilling a commitment, this regulatory approval is a big step forward as we continue to shape the future of surgery.”

Hugo has been in use in Europe since 2022 and was recently recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as one of 11 surgical robots set to be used across the UK National Health Service (NHS).

While Hugo is not yet available in the US, Medtronic’s submission for a urology indication for the robot is currently under review with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with US market entry expected later this year.

In anticipation of Hugo’s approval with the FDA, Medtronic is currently building out its training provision for the RAS system following the introduction of live streaming to its Touch Surgery Ecosystem (TSE) last year. The broad aim of Medtronic’s surgical training provision is to enhance and democratise surgical education on a global scale, removing barriers to training such as geographic location.

With its da Vinci surgical robot, Intuitive Surgical currently holds the largest share of the global robotic surgery market at almost 60%, according to GlobalData analysis. The market is forecast to reach a valuation of $9.2bn by 2034, up from around $2.9bn in 2024.

Due to Medtronic’s size, the Hugo is expected to pose the main challenge to Intuitive’s da Vinci robot once the former is approved in the US.

According to GlobalData analyst Grayson Vigneux, due to Intuitive’s 20-year head start in the US robotic surgery market, its vast installed base and long-standing reputation, Hugo is “more likely to capture new customers rather than immediately displace Intuitive’s existing market”.

Obviously, it also has a lot of relevance for the $3,000,000,000,000 of wealth distribution that we have in Pershing.","BNY Mellon reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2025, surpassing analysts’ expectations with an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.94, compared to the forecasted $1.75.

Conference Operator: Good morning and welcome to the twenty twenty five Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY’s consent.

I will now turn the call over to Marius Mers, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I’m here with Robin Vince, our Chief Executive Officer and Dermot McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. We will reference the quarterly update presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com.

And I’ll note that our remarks will contain forward looking statements and non GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. Information about these statements and non GAAP measures is available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and quarterly update presentation, all of which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, 07/15/2025 and would not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before Dermot takes you through the financials in greater detail, I’ll start with a few summary remarks on our strong performance in the second quarter and a couple of reflections on the first half of the year. Stepping back for a moment to look at the operating environment, we began the quarter in April with elevated market volatility, record U.

S. Equity trading activity and increased treasury market volumes. Through the quarter, we saw shifts in global policy with elevated risk from geopolitical tensions and conflicts as well as uncertainty around trade, fiscal and other policies. Periods of volatility and active markets give BNY the opportunity to deepen the connection with our clients, helping them grow while navigating an evolving business landscape. Our unique position as a financial services platforms company at the heart of the world’s capital markets, combined with our diversified business model allowed us to once again demonstrate our resilience and commercial strength against this backdrop.

Turning to the results of the second quarter and referring to Page two of the quarterly update presentation, BNY delivered a strong performance. Earnings per share of $1.93 were up 27% year over year on a reported basis and up 28% excluding notable items. Total revenue was up 9% year over year and for the first time exceeded $5,000,000,000 in a quarter. In combination with expense growth of 4%, BNY generated another quarter of significant positive operating leverage, roughly 500 basis points on both the reported and operating basis. And in what is seasonally our strongest quarter, our pre tax margin improved to 37% and our return on tangible common equity improved to 28%.

These are clear outputs from our multiyear transformation and robust indicators of BNY’s potential. Turning to Page three. Over the past few years, we have been laying the foundations for our future. In our January update, we outlined how BNY is well positioned to capture market beta and capitalize on evolving market trends as we work hard to generate alpha through the continued transformation of our company. We entered 2025 with good momentum.

Midway through the year, we are seeing results from our consistent execution and continuous delivery that add to our confidence for the medium to long term. Our strategy is simple, but powerful to be more for our clients by running our company better, all powered by our culture. I’ll briefly touch on each. First, our commercial model enables BNY to be more for our clients, helping them achieve their goals using the full breadth and depth of our platforms. As we mark the model’s one year anniversary, early signs point to the growing effectiveness of our commercial organization with significant runway ahead.

We achieved a second consecutive quarter of record sales. The number of multi product relationships continues to grow and we continue to broaden and deepen our engagement with clients. For example, in June, we expanded our relationship with specialist active UK asset manager, Lion Trust. In addition to utilizing our Data Vault and middle office operating capabilities, Lion Trust is fully outsourcing its trading to our buy side trading solutions team, which delivers twenty four hour global trade execution and reaches 100 markets globally across all major asset classes. Another important way for us to be more for our clients is to deliver innovative solutions to the market that come from the powerful combination of capabilities we have at BNY.

As I’ve said before, we’re not just in the product sales business, we’re in the solutions delivery business. BNY enjoys a suite of highly adjacent platforms that when delivered together create powerful solutions for clients. Our commercial model combined with our platforms operating model are intentionally designed to encourage more of this type of innovation. An example of this solutions mindset is our work to build the financial infrastructure of the future by bridging traditional and digital financial ecosystems to enable clients to unlock new capabilities securely and at scale. Early and continuous investments in our digital assets platform have positioned us to meet increasing institutional interest and adoption.

Last month, Societe Generale selected BNY to act as reserve custodian for their first USD stablecoin in Europe. And last week, Ripple announced that BNY will act as primary custodian of Ripple’s USD stablecoin reserves. Today, BNY is a leader in servicing the growing stablecoin market, enabling companies to create and use stablecoins by providing wide ranging services from issuance to ongoing operations. Our advancements in the digital assets ecosystem are just one example of continual innovation, but there are many others. Flexible financing and Global Clearing, the integration of CollateralOne into Liquidity Direct, FX Hedge Direct for private markets, agency lending in Saudi Arabia, depository receipts in Canada, to name just a few.

This is an important theme for us, not just periodic higher profile product launches, but product level micro innovations week by week, month by month that drive our organic growth. Next, on running our company better with purpose. 2025 will be a milestone year for BNY’s transition into our platforms operating model, which realigns how we work and organize ourselves across the entire company. As a reminder, running our company better is not just about expenses, it’s about better. Yes, we are driving efficiency, but we’re also enabling commercial opportunities, enhancing client journeys and accelerating speed to market.

With more than half of our people at BNY working in the model today, we remain on track to complete our phased transition into the platform’s operating model by this time next year. Already, we are starting to see the impact of this new way of working, enabling our people to launch more new solutions, deploy more code releases and come together better than ever before to support our clients. Finally, on culture. Culture is about generating a collective will to make our company achieve its full potential, harnessing the breadth of our talent to be there for clients and to help the company This includes so many things, but one part of that enablement is our embrace of AI. It’s an exciting moment for AI at BNY.

Nearly all of our employees are using our multi agentic enterprise AI platform, ELISA, and we have started to introduce digital employees into our workforce. It’s early days, but we are beginning to see the benefit of some of these agents and digital employees, and we expect that to accelerate in the quarters and years ahead. To wrap up, against the backdrop of a busy operating environment, our priorities are clear and we remain relentlessly focused on execution. BNY is showing strong momentum and we are determined to deliver further value for our clients, our shareholders and our people. At this midpoint of the year, we are pleased to see the initial work of our multiyear transformation bearing fruit.

I’d like to thank our teams around the world for delivering strong results and for their continued commitment to the work ahead. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us, but the strategy to unlock it is working. And with that, over to you, Dermot.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. I’m starting with our consolidated financial results for the second quarter on Page four of the presentation. Total revenue of $5,000,000,000 was up 9% year over year. Fee revenue was up 7%. That included 9% growth in investment services fees from our Security Services and Marketing and Wealth Services segments, driven by net new business, client activity and higher market values.

Investment management and performance fees were flat. Growth from higher market values and the impact of a weaker U. S. Dollar was offset by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates that we discussed on our last earnings call. While not on the page, I will note that firm wide AUCA of $55,800,000,000,000 were up 13% year over year, reflecting client inflows, higher market values and the impact of the weaker dollar.

Assets under management of $2,100,000,000,000 were up 3% year over year, reflecting higher market values and the impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by cumulative net outflows. Foreign exchange revenue was up 16% year over year on the back of elevated volatility and higher volumes, partially offset by the impact of corporate treasury activity. Investment and other revenue was $184,000,000 including $35,000,000 of net losses from investment security sales, partially offset by favorable seed capital and other investments results. Net interest income was up 17 year over year, driven by continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields as well as balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $17,000,000 in the quarter, driven by property specific reserve releases in our commercial real estate portfolio.

Expenses of $3,200,000,000 were up 4% year over year, both on a reported basis and excluding notable items. The variance excluding notable items reflects higher investments, employee merit increases, higher revenue related expenses and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, we reported earnings per share of $1.93 on a reported basis, up 27% year over year. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share were $1.94 up 28% year over year. Our pretax margin was 37%, and our return on tangible common equity was 28% in the quarter.

Turning to capital and liquidity on Page five. At the June, the Federal Reserve released the results of its 2025 bank stress test, which once again underscored BNY’s resilient business model and our strong balance sheet. The results also confirmed that our stress capital buffer remains unchanged at the regulatory floor of 2.5%. With regards to our second quarter results, our Tier one leverage ratio was 6.1%, down 17 basis points sequentially. Tier one capital increased by $689,000,000 primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returns through common stock repurchases and dividends.

Average assets increased primarily driven by deposit growth. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.5%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Over the course of the second quarter, we returned approximately $1,200,000,000 of capital to our common shareholders, resulting in a 92% total payout ratio year to date. With regards to liquidity, the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 112%, down four percentage points sequentially, reflecting elevated deposit balances, which were largely nonoperational in early parts of the quarter. The consolidated net stable funding ratio was 131%, down one percentage point sequentially.

Next, net interest income and balance sheet trends on Page six. Consistent with the backdrop of elevated volatility and active trading in capital markets, we saw clients seek the strength of BNY’s balance sheet and leverage our platforms for execution and settlement. Net interest income of 1,200,000,000 was up 17% year over year and up 4% quarter over quarter. Both the year over year and sequential increase primarily reflect continued reinvestment of maturing investment securities at higher yields as well as balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Average deposit balances grew by 6% sequentially.

Non interest bearing deposits grew by 3% in the quarter and interest bearing deposits grew by 7%. Accordingly, average interest earning assets increased by 6% sequentially. Cash and reverse repo balances increased by 9%. Investment securities balances increased by 4% and loans increased by 2%. Turning to our business segments starting on Page seven.

Security Services reported total revenue of $2,500,000,000 up 10% year over year. Total Investment Services fees were up 10% year over year. In asset servicing, investment services fees grew by 7%, reflecting higher market values and client activity. And in issuer services, investment services fees were up 17%, driven by exceptionally strong client activity in our Depository Receipts business. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 22% year over year on the back of elevated volatility and higher volumes.

Net interest income for the segment was up 13% year over year. Segment expenses of $1,600,000,000 were up 4% year over year, driven by higher investments, employee merit increases, revenue related expenses and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar, partially offset by efficiency savings. Security Services reported pretax income of $867,000,000 up 26% year over year and a pretax margin of 35%. On to Marks and Well Services on Page eight. In our Marks and Wealth Services segment, we reported total revenue of $1,700,000,000 up 13% year over year.

Total investment services fees were up 9% year over year. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 8%, reflecting client activity and higher market values. Net new assets were a negative 10,000,000,000 in the quarter, reflecting the deconversion of a client that was acquired by a self clearing competitor. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 14%, driven by broad based growth in collateral balances and clearance volumes. And in treasury services, investment services fees were up 3%, reflecting net new business.

Net interest income for the segment was up 21% year over year. Segment expenses of $897,000,000 were up 8% year over year, driven by higher investments and litigation reserves, employee merit increases and higher revenue related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Taken together, our Marks and Well Services segment reported pretax income of $851,000,000 up 21% year over year and a pretax margin of 49%. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page nine. Our Investment and Wealth Management segment reported total revenue of $8.00 $1,000,000 down 2% year over year.

Investment management fees were down 1% year over year, driven by the mix of AUM flows and the adjustment for certain rebates, partially offset by higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. Segment expenses of $653,000,000 were down 2% year over year, driven by lower revenue related expenses and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher severance expense and the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar. Investment and Wealth Management reported pretax income of $148,000,000 down 1% year over year and a pretax margin of 19%. As I described earlier, assets under management of $2,100,000,000,000 were up 3% year over year. In the second quarter, we saw $17,000,000,000 of net outflows driven by index, multi asset and equity strategies, partially offset by net inflows into cash and fixed income strategies.

Wealth Management client assets of $339,000,000,000 increased by 10% year over year, largely driven by higher market values. Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment. For this segment, I’ll just note that the sequential decrease in revenue primarily reflects the net losses from investment securities activity I mentioned earlier, while the sequential decrease in expenses reflects lower litigation reserves and severance. Turning to Page 11. I’ll close with a midyear update of the financial outlook for 2025 that we provided on our earnings call in January.

As you can see on the slide, BNY is entering the second half of the year with great momentum, while we remain cognizant of the economic outlook amid elevated geopolitical and policy uncertainty. Based on where we sit today, looking out to the balance of the year, we now expect full year 2025 net interest income to be up high single digit percentage points year over year. And we continue to expect solid fee revenue growth in 2025, of course, market dependent. We now expect expenses excluding notable items for the year to be up approximately 3% year over year. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be in the 22% to 23% range.

Considering our twenty one percent tax rate in the first half, that means approximately 23% for the second half of the year. And we continue to expect to return roughly 100% plus or minus of 2025 earnings through common dividends and buybacks over the course of the year. Following the release of the Federal Reserve’s annual bank stress test, our Board of Directors declared a 13% increase of our quarterly common stock dividend, and we plan to continue repurchasing common shares under our existing share repurchase program. As always, we consider macroeconomic and interest rate environments, balance sheet growth and many other factors with a conservative bias in managing the pace of our buybacks. To wrap up, BNY posted very strong results in the second quarter, demonstrating the impact of consistent execution and delivery amid a complex, but yet for BNY constructive operating environment.

The momentum of our multiyear transformation continues to build and progress to date gives us incremental confidence in BNY’s great potential for the medium and long term. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q and A?

Conference Operator: We’ll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Ebrahim Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America: Thanks. Good morning.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Good morning, Ebrahim.

Ebrahim Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America: Maybe Robin for you, so the call in terms of the transformation efforts, digital assets, AI just sounds like significant runway on all things organic. But address for us how you’re thinking about capital deployment relative to where the stock is trading at today? And I’m sure this is not news to you in terms of news around BNY pursuing a merger with a competitor, your interview in Barron. So give us a sense of when we think about capital deployment as shareholders, how should we think what the priority is outside of funding the business, be it buybacks versus M and A? Thanks.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Sure. So look, the beginning point of what you said is actually the most important thing. We have got strong momentum. We really see the pathway to be able to generate value over the medium and long term. Obviously, you’re seeing some of the early signs of that and we’re pleased with it.

And that is our biggest focus because at the end of the day, at the top of the capital waterfall is that ability to invest in the business. Now look, the good news is that we’re a pretty capital light business. You can see it in the 28% ROTCE that we generated in the quarter. We’re pleased with that. That’s another sign of the transition and transformation of the company towards this more platforms orientation because that is the sort of feature that you’d expect of a company, in terms of the direction of travel that we’ve got going.

Now in terms of the sort of the inorganic stuff, look our broad approach hasn’t changed, which is M and A done well can be a powerful tool in the toolkit. It’s not our custom to comment on any specific rumor or speculation. But I think we demonstrated last year with the Archer acquisition that we’ve got the ability to make M and A work for us in a sensible way. Having said that, I just really want to underscore this point. It’s a very high bar for us for M and A, especially a larger transaction.

It would have to make a ton of sense. We’d need to have a lot of conviction and execution. We’re focused on ongoing alignment with our strategic priorities, strong cultural fit matters and of course the financials really have to work. And our M and A story is a two sided story as well because you saw that last year, we bought Archer, but we sold our Corporate Trust Canada business. So the punch line I’ll leave you with is we are focused on our organic growth.

That is working. We are beginning the process of a multiyear journey on that. And we’re going to be open because we should be open to sensible things inorganically if they make sense. But I’ll underline again if they make sense.

Ebrahim Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America: That’s very clear. Thank you. And I guess maybe just following up on that, you referenced the 27% ROTC this quarter. I get it’s a seasonally strong quarter. But as we think about again relative to new investors trying to put money to work in the stock, is structurally based on all the work you’ve done so far over the last few years and where things are going, is it safe for investors, shareholders, the street to assume that this is becoming a high 20s, not C institution, which should then support a very different multiple than we’ve been used to for the last several years?

Thanks.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: So look, I’ll blend sort of two things together here. One is the broader medium term targets as we think about them. We have not put a ceiling on any of our medium term targets. We viewed them as milestones on a longer journey. At the time that we first communicated them, people understandably thought about them as ambitious based on where we had been in the past.

But we are on a journey here and we are making important steps forward. And so, on ROTCE specifically, we don’t see a ceiling on that number, because as a more platforms oriented company, remember, NII is only 25% of our revenues view that as broadly a proxy for the balance sheet, which means three quarters of our business is largely a pretty capital light business that’s driving forward in terms of fee growth. And so I would just look generally at our medium term targets and I would throw ROTCE your question into that as well and say we have a lot of ambition. We think we’re relatively early in our journey and we’re absolutely going to be moving the bar higher on ourselves, which frankly we do every single day in terms of how we run the company. Perfect.

Thank you, Robert. Thanks.

Conference Operator: We’ll move to our next question from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.

Ken Usdin, Analyst, Autonomous Research: Hey, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about just the evolution of as the year goes on of just overall top of the house performance. Because obviously you’re taking up your NII guide, but NII is only 25% of revenues. And while the cost guide is up, I think maybe misses the point that on the fee side, your guide is only just for year over year and here we are plus 6% in the second quarter and plus 7% for the year to date. So I’m just wondering on the fee side, are fees better than your original expectations too?

And is that informing as much as the NII upside the slight drip up on the overall cost guide as the total is coming in better?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Hey, Ken, I’ll start with that. Look, the way I kind of think about the firm is I start with overall positive operating leverage. And I guess a key message I would leave you there, both on operating and reported basis, I think it was roughly 500 basis points of operating leverage. And so since Robin took over as CEO, we’ve kind of made the positive operating leverage our North Star. And so consistently delivering that to the market has been our kind of the core strategy around how we think about the financials.

So you have three components to that. You’ve got fees, you’ve got NII and you’ve got expenses. And you’ll see from the financials, yes, revenue up 9%, expenses up 4%, delivering that positive operating leverage. Within the revenue, you’ve got fees, you’ve got NII, really solid performance on NII, which gives us comfort around for the balance of the year, giving a higher guide to kind of high single digits. And on the revenue side, I think the strength in fees really underscores the commercial model that we launched about a year ago, two consecutive quarters of kind of record sales.

Notwithstanding that, the second quarter is a seasonally strong quarter, so we would expect strong sales. But that was on the back of a Q1. And we see going into Q3, although it is a kind of seasonally slower quarter for us given the vacations, etcetera, we see kind of strong momentum continuing. So you see a picture on Page three of the midyear update where we kind of show you a little pictorial about how we think about organic growth, and we have high conviction around that beginning to build and grow. And Ken, let

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: me just build on a couple of things that Dermot said. So first of all, yes, it was a constructive environment in the second quarter. But I’ll bring you back to our comments in January when we talked about the various different things that drive our business. We’ve intentionally been repositioning the company gradually to be able to take advantage of more different types of environments. So I think the punchline is, well, there are always amazing environments that you could have for a business or potentially environments which just don’t have any element of being particularly constructive.

We think we’re broadening out the probabilities of any given environment actually working reasonably well for us because equity markets up, fixed income markets up, equity volumes up, fixed income volumes up, transaction volumes and GDP up, issuance up, asset management activity, wealth management activity. There are a lot of cylinders in this particular engine. And so the second quarter was constructive, but we have been positioning the company to be able to take advantage of more and more environment as constructive. And I think that plus the point that Dermot made around our commercial model is allowing us to grind organic growth higher. So we want to take advantage of the beta.

We want to be able to participate in whatever the quarter happens to bring. But this constant focus on alpha generation in terms of how we’re running the company and positioning the company is an important part of the story. And we do think that this is a quarter where you’re starting to see that. But again, the early innings point that Dermot and I have made many times before, there’s a lot of runway here in our estimation.

Ken Usdin, Analyst, Autonomous Research: Understood. That’s great color. And I do like that upper right chart on Page three. Just one thing on the environment then, can you you’ve talked previously about just the stickiness of deposits and obviously that’s informing the better than expected NII outlook. Does anything change in the environment to that point?

Because I think Robin will bring back in your point about like tools in the kit and arsenal to just continue to add deposits. But maybe you could just help us understand the environmental side a little bit. Thank you.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So I think point number one here that I would make, Ken, is as a matter of strategy, we don’t really lead with deposits. So when you see deposits being a little bit higher, the mix of IBNIB a little bit higher, it really speaks to the breadth and the depth of the franchise and doing more with clients. And doing more with clients kind of attracts deposits. And specifically around second quarter in our Corporate Trust business, we had higher levels of activity and we were able to kind of help clients with unique specific situations that attracted deposits into the system, particularly on the NIB side. And that was able for us to kind of have a good NII print this quarter.

And when we look out for the balance of the year and run our various scenarios, we really have reduced the tails with respect to interest rate sensitivity and that was really on the back of a ton of work done towards the back end of last year when the Fed made the pivot after Jackson Hole around the forward rate curve. And so that gives us now a lot of confidence to be able to kind of provide that higher NII growth against what is a constructive backdrop for us.

Ken Usdin, Analyst, Autonomous Research: Thanks very much guys.

Conference Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.

Glenn Schorr, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Hi, thanks very much. So much going well, forgive me, I’m going to pick on the one area that wasn’t as good as everything else in Investment Management. So fees down a little bit, flows out, margins down in that $20.19 range, so despite the good market. So the question is, if we step back a little bit and we talk about can we talk a little bit about what investments you’re making to improve the business? And like what’s high on your to do list to help drive better performance as we move forward in Investment Management?

Thanks.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Thanks for the question, Glenn. I would say investment number one was Robin appointing Jose as the leader of that business and he started last September. And you can see between the first quarter where we had a margin of 8% to this quarter where we’re about 19%, you can see that step up in margin. And you can see Jose is beginning to work the opportunity and making some decisions to right size it from an efficiency standpoint. And I’m very pleased with what Jose has done.

What I also think he’s doing very, very effectively, and look, both Robin and myself will have talked about this on prior quarters, the one BNY approach in terms of de siloing the firm, you kind of have to go that extra mile as it relates to our investment in wealth management strategy and bringing the boutiques closer to the firm. And I think Jose sees a lot of opportunity for us to cross sell within the firm, both within our asset servicing business and within our purging business. So bringing the strength of our manufacturing capabilities to our Pershing clients and our asset servicing clients is a kind of a key forward strategy that we can see we can do well at and also bringing in leadership and product development. So I think you’re going to see more positive stories coming from this particular segment. But as with all transformations, it takes a little bit time and Jose is getting that time to make the decisions that he needs to.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: And Glenn, let me just build on one particular point that Dermot just made. One of Jose’s early observations about the business was we have a terrific to use Dermot’s term manufacturing base. If you look under the hood of our $2,100,000,000,000 of AUM, you have some real market leading franchises. We have Insight, which is number one in its market. That’s $1,000,000,000,000 of it right there.

You have Walter Scott, which is terrific long only, long dated equity manager. You have a terrific business in the form of Dreyfus’ money markets. And we have in Mellon, a direct indexer that’s capable of being able to create product that our asset servicing clients are very interested in. Obviously, it also has a lot of relevance for the $3,000,000,000,000 of wealth distribution that we have in Pershing. So if you think about the manufacturing base, let’s give ourselves a check that we have a pretty good set of businesses that are actually performing pretty well.

On the distribution, if we didn’t have BNY, then you could look at asset management and you could say there are a lot of parallels with other mid sized to large asset managers and the question of distribution would be on everybody’s lips. But one of Jose’s observations was, wow, this investment manager at BNY is one of the reasons why I joined BNY because there’s all of this distribution potential, but we just haven’t fully unlocked it. Okay. So then what sits in the middle? And that’s the word that Dermot used product, where if you take a metaphor for this for a second, imagine that you were a Coke or a Pepsi and you were making a beverage and you had the concentrate and you have all of this terrific distribution because you can sell in restaurants, you can sell in grocery stores, you can sell in a corner store as well.

But in the middle of that is a critical point of product, which is are you taking the manufacturing base that you have and making cans when you want to sell it in the corner store. Because if you put bottles of concentrate in a corner store, it’s not going to help you. But when you’re delivering to a large fast food outlet, there you want to be able to deliver the concentrate, cans not as useful. So this piece in the middle, this product shaping that leverages the manufacturing base with an eye to the distribution channels that you have available to you is critical. And I think we haven’t done as good a job on that as we could.

And so that’s a very big focus for us. And we think that when you take all of those things together, we think there’s an interesting pathway here.

Glenn Schorr, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Thanks for all that. Maybe I could do a tiny follow-up on previous question. Forgive me if you said it, but the fee revenue were up 5% for the first half and the guide is still up on the year. Markets are higher. Despite this conversation we just had on investment management, feels like deliberately conservative, which I’m cool with.

I’m just curious on how we square the up five for the first half. Markets are trending well. Your momentum is good. Why wouldn’t the fee outlook be better? I know I asked you that last quarter and you outperformed.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So the way I would answer it is, it’s like there are a lot of factors that go into the fee, a lot of external factors that we don’t necessarily control, very market dependent. We kind of go back to the foundational building blocks of the platform operating model and the commercial model, which is it’s still only a year old, but it is working. You can see it. We have higher conviction about our ability to drive organic fee growth from here. But and we’ve changed a lot over the last three years, Glenn, about the transparency of our numbers and how we give you a lot more than we did three years ago.

So I think as we get more conviction and as we get more kind of sales telemetry around us, we’ll give you more guidance as we feel comfortable. But for now, I think the momentum is there, the upward trajectory is there, but we’re not ready to yet guide on specifics around fees. And third quarter is usually a seasonally slower quarter and Q2 is a seasonally strong quarter. So it’s important to be balanced in that as well.

Glenn Schorr, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Fair enough. Thanks for all that.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Thanks, Glenn.

Conference Operator: We’ll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Betsy Graseck, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Hi. Good morning, Robin. Good morning, Dermot.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Good morning, Betsy.

Betsy Graseck, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: I wanted dig in a little bit on the AI commentary that you had Robin. And starting off, the operating leverage is just so strong, almost double what consensus had baked in for you and really terrific results here. I wanted to understand your comments on AI as it relates to the forward look because you indicated that nearly all your employees are using the Eliza AI platform and you’re starting to you’re beginning to see the benefit of this. I mean, is it the benefit from AI at a level that we can see in these operating leverage results? Maybe you could help us understand is this more revenues or expenses?

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Sure. Well, thanks for your comments about positive operating leverage. As Dermot and I both said over time Betsy that is a great North Star. And going back to Glenn’s question at the end there, one of the reasons why we’ve been always a little reluctant to guide on all of the elements underneath the hood of positive operating leverage is we recognize the composition in any quarter or any year could be a little different. And we don’t want to create ceilings for ourselves.

We are extremely hungry for positive operating leverage and we see a ton of pathway. And when you go under the hood, one of the reasons why over the past three years, we’ve really focused on showing you all the inputs to what we’re doing is because we recognize that the timing of exactly when each of these strategies starts to really hit, varies a little bit. And so we’ve got several things driving the positive operating leverage. We’ve got a commercial engine, which is starting to now make a meaningful contribution. Output evidence, you can see it in the record sales quarters that we had in the first and second quarter.

The platform’s operating model, we knew there would be a longer lead times that. We started work on it three years ago and now it’s starting to come into its own, but it’s still very early days because only less than 10% of our people have been in the model for at least a year. And as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we see the actual value really starting to shine through in Platform’s operating model after we’ve had people in the model for about that period of time. So that is still to come, a little bit of it now, most of it ’26, ’27, ’28 and beyond. The next layer is the heart of your question, which is AI.

We view AI as a top line story and an expense story in because what we’re really doing is we’re unlocking capacity in the company. And we want to then be able to use that capacity to do other higher value things. That’s why we’ve been encouraging all of our people to participate in AI because we view our AI solutions, which we put on the page three, again demonstrating the inputs today and then we’ll show you the outputs over time. We see those as being able to be very helpful as too will be our digital employees, as essentially companions and leverage for our people to be able to go faster and create capacity for themselves that they can reinvest in doing new things, pushing forward with clients, more time in the day, all of the above. So our excitement about AI is a very medium to long term excitement, but we’ve invested heavily early on in the psychology of it in the company so that we have AI for everyone, everywhere, for everything.

And that’s really how we think about AI. So it’s early days. There’s not a ton in the P and L right now to your point with net investment, but we are starting to see the early signs of what we think will be an acceleration twenty twenty six, twenty twenty seven, 2028, 2029 beyond.

Glenn Schorr, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: Hi. No good deed goes unpunished. I know you talked about organic growth

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: You could make that one of your punch lines, Mike. You could I know you’ve trademarked the world’s worst oligopoly, but that one you could put it you could put in trademark

Ebrahim Poonawala, Analyst, Bank of America: as well.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: And BNY, not your parents’ bank.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: Look, I’m the first to say you’ve optimized much better than I had expected these last two years. And you have these very high returns, but the organic growth and you do it correctly, ex markets, ex currency, ex deals, whether it’s 2% or 3%, is still not great in the scheme of the overall world. And I know you want that growth to be better. And I know you said you had record sales, but it’s the growth is still the growth. It hasn’t changed that much at an organic level.

And I know you guys have thought about this, but to the degree you sacrificed the high, very high returns to reinvest for better growth than what the company has had for the past five, ten, twenty years, right? And so where do you stand in that trade off of maybe having lower returns or maybe not raising your return targets and reinvesting more for growth? And where should that organic growth be in your perfect world the way you define it?

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Sure. So several things here, Mike. So one of the reasons why we put that chart, the top right corner of Page three was to illustrate the fact that organic growth has been growing. I hear your point about three versus two, but three is still 50% more than two and significantly up from where it has been in the past. But a few other points to note.

Our growth in the past generally has been quite subject to markets. And so, we are very happy to take advantage of constructive backdrops. And as I answered in a prior question, we’re trying to position the company to take advantage of more types of backdrops so that we can be less handed our results by the market conditions and more in charge of our own destiny. That’s a very deliberate strategy and we feel like we’re making some progress on that. So that’s sort of the next observation.

The next thing under the hood is what are the prerequisites for the real type of organic growth that you’re talking about? You’ve challenged us on understandably and rightly so over the course of the past two or three years. And this is where we really feel like we’ve set the table for the future. And to your point about how we think about investing versus harvesting, we’ve been very clear on this. We are taking a decade view of the transformation of BNY and we’re pleased where we are close to three years in.

But we are far from done because much of what we have done has actually been investing for the future and we’re in the very early stages of seeing that being harvested. We talked about the commercial model. We talked about the platforms operating model. We talked about AI, which is part of the growth story as well as it is on the expenses. But let me just come back to the key elements of what we’ve got.

We’ve got a diversified set of platforms that is yes, helping us to be more diversified in different environments, but it is also allowing us to better position to capitalize on these market trends and to generate alpha because it’s less one business going to market by itself. It’s more what’s the synergy between the component parts. A client who custodies with us, who also does treasury clearing with us, who also does collateral management with us, is going to be able to get better outcomes over time because of the fact that all of those things can just be book entry for us within our ecosystem. That allows us to move to twenty four hour. That allows us to think and embrace digital assets maybe in a different way than somebody else can.

And you’re starting to see the early signs of these platforms coming together to show something where the sum is more than the individual parts. And that’s what our commercial model is actually about. So we’re investing in these micro innovations, the bigger things, the synergies between the platforms. We’ve positioned people behind this. We’ve positioned culture behind this and we’re organizing the company behind this.

And we think it is starting to show, but we absolutely agree with you that there should be more a lot more gas in the tank here.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Mike, I would add just a couple of more points as well. One is, you asked the question sometimes about negative pricing. We just we haven’t seen it this quarter, which really kind of goes to the efficiency point about us being able to reduce our cost to serve, which is able to help us drive the organic growth because we’re able to compete more effectively to win our share of business. So that would be point number one. Point number two, to Robin’s point about the commercial model, now we’re in the early stages of a product model, which is joining with the commercial model, and that’s been led by Carolyn Weinberg, where she’s able to see in between the scenes of our various businesses to create new products that clients want.

So lots of opportunity to come there. And the third point I would make is when you look at the firm overall and you have to think about the enterprise, it’s a 37% pretax margin diversified business model. And so when you look at IWM, which is now hovering around the 19%, it’s upside from here for the enterprise as we resume that path towards 25%, which is going to further fuel organic growth at the enterprise level.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: And I guess just one more follow-up on the talk about acquisitions. And I heard you, it can be a powerful tool. If it makes sense, you’re not doing anything stupid, I hear you. But as you broaden the art of what’s possible, since you are talking about being a different type of not your parents, BNY, because you are more diverse in terms of your offerings. What’s the realm of possibilities for acquisition?

Clearly, traditional trust businesses or sub businesses are always possible going back to the merger, the big merger. But what other areas would you consider maybe buying?

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: So it’s an important question, Mike. Again, our primary focus is on driving the growth. And but there are really different pathways on this thing. So we two or three years ago, we said there’s absolutely no way that we’re going to make any acquisitions. Then we sort of warmed up to the idea of capability buys, which is how I would frame Archer.

And that really does check the box of helping us to go faster to derisk because we could buy versus having to build ourselves. And we’re seeing the early signs of that output, great client feedback, the integration’s been going well, new client wins as a result of it. So I still think that that is the most likely path for us when it comes to M and A helping us to go faster. And I’m going to guess, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Those types of things are generally more likely to be in the bits of the business which are a little bit more platform like.

Although it’s interesting that Archer was a buy once use across the firm type of acquisition. So that’s our expectation for the primary focus. Because the bar for larger transactions is super high, we’d have to have a lot of conviction in the execution of something like that, because clearly they could be quite complicated. And there you could make a case elsewhere in some of the other segments that maybe there would be the opportunity to have even more scale. Because if you’re a scale player and you’ve got a platform’s operating model like organization, the thesis would be that you could bolt on more activity onto your existing chassis and there would be a lot of scalability associated with that.

So that’s a fine thesis and something that we certainly keep in mind as well. But as now we have close to two thirds of the company in platform like businesses either in MWS or in our issuer services business. When you look at MWS alone, it’s a 49% margin. We’ve choices in this space, but we’re not going to let those choices get distracting for us. We are focused on building our company to your favorite term, the organic way.

And then we’ll just be opportunistic and disciplined on external related stuff.

Mike Mayo, Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities: Message heard. Thank you.

Conference Operator: We’ll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

Alex Blostein, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning for the question. Thank you. Busy morning. So I had a couple of questions for you guys around the new business opportunities.

I know you mentioned a couple of things around the digital assets and just kind of tokenized environment, which obviously continues to be quite dynamic. I was hoping you could build on that a little more. Obviously, there’s a lot of debates in the financial services industry today, perhaps more so on this topic than in the past in terms of what’s a risk versus what’s an opportunity. So when you think about where BNY sits in that realm, where do you see both risk to the existing businesses and some of the new revenue opportunities that could come out of this?

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Sure. Thanks, Alex. Net net, we see these advancements providing more opportunities than risks. But you’re right, there are things on both sides of the ledger. If you just go back and just think about industries and big changes in technology that happen over time, they create disruption.

And what disruption does is it allows for a little bit of a reorganization sometimes of the ecosystem. And it’s our observation that companies that have a lot of forward thinking innovation that push forward that take advantage of that as opposed to sticking their heads in the sand tend to be winners. Now, we have many specific valuable attributes that help us make us a great partner to these digital assets firms. And that’s one of the reasons why we’ve been so engaged in this space for several years, because initially it had been about providing our traditional banking services to those digital asset companies. We serve many of them with our traditional banking services.

Then it’s been about helping with the on ramps, off ramps between that traditional banking world and the on chain world. And in the future, we think it’s also going to be about more activity on chain. We are live with Bitcoin custody today. We do it natively and we can help clients. There’s more stuff in the world.

We want to be we’re in the business of looking after stuff as one of our businesses and we’re happy to do that. But we’re also in the payments business. Again, there’s synergy between our platforms. We’re also in the issuer services corporate trustee business. There’s synergy.

We’re in the NAV business. That’s relevant. Synergy. Distribution business. Relevant.

Money market fund business. Relevant. So when you take all of these things together, we’re a terrific partner for some of these clients, because we can do a lot of different things with a trusted brand that actually helps them to feel good. So look, stablecoins particularly, it’s obviously one of the topics of the day and we’re very active in that space. And that’s the reason why we mentioned a couple of those recent examples, but there are many more in our prepared remarks.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: But Alex, what I would say is don’t lose also that’s all great stuff, but don’t lose sight of our core businesses that are market leading, that are growing share because the market is growing. So growing the pie with existing clients in our core businesses is also happening and very important.

Alex Blostein, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Yes. That’s totally fair. Dermot, one for you on just the balance sheet dynamic and deposits. I know you mentioned you guys don’t lead with deposits that all make sense. But when we look at the trajectory for the deposit base over the last couple of quarters, obviously much more stable and nice to see the non interest bearing deposits improving here as well.

So as you look out into the back half and ultimately where we are in July, maybe give us a sense where non interest deposits in particular sit? And as we think about the forward, which businesses tend to drive those for you guys as sort we of think about the trajectory beyond 2025?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So it was a strong quarter. I expect the balances to moderate into Q3. You might remember Q3 of last year was a strong quarter for us in terms of NII. So Q3 is a tough comp. And deposits we expect to moderate at the seasonal slowdown.

And so the diversity of the NIB across the franchise is particularly pleasing, but Corporate Trust is a highlight. And because of the breadth and the depth and the market shares that we have in that business, we do attract a lot of cash into the system by virtue of increased client activity. So Corporate Trust in Q2 was a notable highlight, particularly around escrows as a result of increased M and A activity. So but I would expect that to moderate a little bit in Q3 and pick up again in Q4. But overall, I feel pretty convicted around the high mid single digits NII growth for the year.

Alex Blostein, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: All righty. Thank you so much.

Conference Operator: We’ll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY0: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe two separate questions on the Platforms operating model. So first one, maybe for you, Dermot, focusing on the cost reduction element, as we’ve another 50% to migrate over the next, call it, twelve months.

And I know, obviously, guidance went up a little bit, which makes complete sense given the stronger revenue growth environment and also the dynamic budgeting aspect that you’ve talked about. But on the cost reduction side from that conversion on the platform’s operating model, how should we think about framing that as a positive contributor to the expense story for the rest of this year in 2026?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So I do go back to a little bit Brian what Robin said earlier about 50% of the people are in the model. We’ve done three waves over the last fifteen months. The maturity level between Wave one and Wave three is quite stark. And what the Wave one businesses that went into the model are doing now in terms of 1B and Y connectivity, automation, dynamic innovation, having an entrepreneurial spirit within their own businesses, it gives me a great sense of pride to actually see it day in, day out. And while your question led with the cost reduction, we really think about it internally about running the company better and creating capacity.

And we either deploy that capacity into new investments, new opportunities or we let it flow through to positive operating leverage. And you can see in Q2 of this year, we kind of gave you gave the market 500 basis points of positive operating leverage and the platform operating model was a contributor to that. So with 50% of the firm in the model and 10% in about fifteen months, I would expect the maturity of this to kind of give us a benefit for the next few years. And so it’s not for another two years where I would say the firm will be reasonably mature in the model and it’s creating its own flywheel of momentum and innovation. And when you overlay that with the maturity of the commercial model and you overlay that again with what Carolyn is doing on the product side, you’re going to see the North Star of positive operating leverage be delivered for the foreseeable future.

So I don’t like it’s all about running the company better, and I don’t talk internally about expenses or cost reduction.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY0: Yes. Okay. That’s great. And then maybe just also on a following question on the Platforms operating model. As you think about M and A, maybe just your thoughts around how much the operating model Platforms operating model kind of informs your decision about what type of M and A to do?

Is it a main is it a major or a primary factor in bringing on businesses that you think can fit into that model and therefore you can scale them inorganically? And then I guess is it even possible to do large scale M and A and integrate that into this platform? Or do you see too many disparities with other large providers that would make that difficult?

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Yes. It’s an important question. So look broadly on the platform’s operating model, Dermot touched on the fact that it’s a two sided thing because we’re very much looking for it to drive revenue. This interlock between platforms operating model and the commercial model is super important because by having defined our products and client platforms in the way that we have And then by layering over that a new go to market approach with our commercial model, that’s just allowing us to go faster, collaborate more across the platforms, create more solutions and really create a lot of empowerment to our teams to go and listen to clients, invent new stuff, provide more solutions to them. And of course that and just running the company better, more broadly as Dermot mentioned, those are the reasons why we are doing this.

Now, has a nice byproduct, which is it organizes ourselves in a way where our chassis is super well organized and very strong. And we clearly see the benefits of that across the board as we continue to go through the model. And so I think what that will result in is when we talk about some type of bolt on acquisition and almost irrespective of its size. If it’s sort of adding to us in something that we broadly do today or something that essentially speeds us forward in something that we do today, we’re able to add it with really out having to take on all of the expenses associated with us because it sort of becomes a bolt on to a chassis that we have. You could see that with Archer as a good example, which is they are able to do more of what they want to do because they’re able to tap in to the right additional parts of BNY.

The client onboarding capabilities that our client onboarding platform provides to Archer in its acquisition of new clients allows them to go faster. The fact that we’ve been able to wrap our technology and our AI around that is going to allow them to do more things. And so there’s a real economy you’re able actually achieve an economy of scale and actually add scale to a scale business or go faster in a business where you’re adding a capability. Whereas sometimes that’s a theoretical conversation because you look at something and you say, well, you could just, you’re pretty scaled, you could just add more stuff and it’ll scale. But that’s not true if you’re adding a complicated backend and you’re trying to smash two incompatible things together.

And I think that was a lesson that this company learned twenty years ago with the acquisition between or the merger between Mellon and BNY. That was not consolidated properly. So the punchline is the platform’s operating model allows us to have a clarity of chassis that I think actually will allow for higher quality integrations in the future if ever we choose to do one.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY0: Yes. That’s great color. Thank you.

Conference Operator: Take our next question from David Smith with Truist Securities.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: Good morning. So you’re pretty clear that you see further upside on returns and margin from here even with the strong results you’ve had in this quarter in the first half. Are there areas right now that you feel like you’re over earning? Or would you say that you’re looking to hold or improve profitability across the firm from these levels right now?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: I would say, it’s a good question, David. How I would answer that is, we’re trying to get better every day in every business. And a mindset I adopt with everybody that I work with and talk to is 1% improvement every day, be better, run the company better, always be humble, it’s all about the client and if you keep the client happy, you’re going to win more business. And that really is, I think, our secret sauce. I talked to a couple of people this week who’ve been at the firm last a long time and I said, what’s the difference between BNY today and BNY ten years ago?

And in a word, was about client centricity. And so we’re very focused on putting the client at the heart of everything that we do. And so I wouldn’t say that any one business we feel like we’ve reached max potential because we’ve invested in a lot. If you kind of take Corporate Trust two or three years ago, that was a well that was a high performing business from a margin standpoint but had been neglected for a long time with respect to investment because the margin was good. But now we’ve kind of decided to invest in the business and we’re growing share.

We’re doing it at a higher margin than we did before. We’re using AI. We have better employee NPS scores. So all in the round, the strategy is working when you look at the three strategic pillars for that particular business. If you looked at it objectively three years ago, you would say nothing to do there.

We felt like there was a lot to do and we’re making great progress. David, let me add a couple

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: of things because this your question is one of these things that we debate quite a bit internally as a team and it goes back actually to the very earliest days of us re underwriting our strategy. At the time, you might remember us saying this, we looked back over the industry for instance on annual operating leverage and we say, does great look like? What the two best performers in the prior decade from 2012 to 2022 on positive operating leverage and what actually is that number? And the answer was, well, it was 150 basis points of positive operating leverage on average over the course of that decade. So we said, okay, well, we think we can be best in class.

We think we’ve got the businesses to do it. Let’s shoot for that. And lo and behold, we’ve sort of blown that out of the water in 2023 and 2024 and also in the first half of twenty twenty five. So it begs the question to ourselves about are we over earning? How does the environment fit into this?

And then we realized of course, well, we keep talking about being a platforms operating company. We have these great set of businesses. We don’t actually think the banks are our pure comp. We think that there’s also a comp out there with other platforms companies and other financial services platforms company who don’t happen to exist in bank form. And so when you start to look at the world through those lenses, suddenly ROTCE, you can see a pathway to bigger numbers and you can see a pathway to bigger numbers on margin.

And we look at those types of comps and we say, okay, let us not be satisfied with what we originally thought of as maybe the way that we think about positive operating leverage. It’s okay to push harder. Having said that, we constantly want to be able to invest. And so to Dermot’s point, we’re not going to let a pursuit of positive operating leverage cause us somehow to underinvest in the business. We are investing with a decade view first and foremost.

But I think it does go to one of the earlier questions and your point also about are there ceilings. So I’m sure there will be, but we’re not allowing ourselves including not being lulled into a sense of security by achieving our medium term outlooks and targets. We’re not allowing ourselves to think about any ceilings across the business.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: So just to push you a little bit on that, if you’re not putting any ceilings or capping yourself on growth on expenses in order to achieve positive operating leverage, why not invest a little bit more than just 3% expense growth, given the strong backdrop you’re seeing and strong performance you’ve shown so far in the first half?

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: No, it’s a good push and we do challenge ourselves on that question. I think if you were in our sort of weekly syncs on these types of topics internally, you’d hit Dermot on a regular basis going out to the various different businesses and platforms and say, tell me what you need to invest. Do you need more investment and more expense allocation in order to be able to help you to go faster? And so that is a constant push that we are giving to the businesses. Now having said that, we are mindful of the fact that some of what we do is also dictated by the environment.

Maybe less and less over time, but it’s clearly is still a meaningful backdrop for us. And so we are naturally a little bit conservative in terms of how we think about the year going into it. Because if for instance, we’d had a much, much tougher backdrop, would not have been impossible in the quarter when you think about what was happening in April and all of the sort of uncertainties that were in April, we wouldn’t have felt comfortable necessarily if we’d had a more negative environment growing our expense guide. So there’s a certain amount of agility as opposed to going into the year assuming everything’s going to be perfect, betting on a big expense number and then getting disappointed. That’s the old version of BNY Mellon.

That’s not the BNY of today.

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Financial discipline is a very important skill and muscle memory that we’ve developed over the last few years. And we’d like to think that you have given us some credibility for that. It’s not our desire to lose that. So financial discipline is very important to us.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY0: All

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY1: right. Thank you.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Thanks, David.

Conference Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Rajiv Vatia with Morningstar. Your line is now open.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY2: Great. Good morning. Yes, just want to follow-up on your remarks that you’re not seeing negative pricing. Should I interpret that as pricing being flat year over year? And is that on a consolidated basis?

Are you seeing the pricing environment differ by LOB?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: So I would it’s broadly flat across the firm and significantly improved from three years ago where I would say it was a headwind a few years ago. And I think as a result of all the strategies and the initiatives that we talked to you about and that we’ve talked about today, I would say repricing, if I was to give you a stat, is roughly down about 80% from where it was three years ago. And so overall at the enterprise level, it’s flat to slightly positive this year so far.

Marius Mers, Head of Investor Relations, BNY2: And does it differ by like LOB?

Dermot McDonough, Chief Financial Officer, BNY: Not really. No. Not there’s no standout really by LOB. I would say it’s broadly consistent.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Thank you.

Conference Operator: And with that, that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I would now like to hand the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks.

Robin Vince, Chief Executive Officer, BNY: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Marius and the IR team. Be well and enjoy the rest of the summer.

Conference Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at two p. M. Eastern Time today.

Have a great day.

Amazon was the second-largest retailer with $273.7 billion in U.S. sales, representing 9% growth. Costco came in third with $183 billion, about 4% growth.

Others in the Top 10 included Kroger, The Home Depot, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Target, Lowe’s and Albertsons. Though there were some moves within that list, many of the Top 10 remained the same as last year.

“I would say you could take last year’s list and just flip it over for 2025,” said David Marcotte, senior vice president of global retail and technology for Kantar, which compiled the list, in a statement.

Overall, however, some categories are seeing more strength (and weaknesses) than others. Drugstores, for instance, are not doing as well as had been expected prior to the COVID emergency. While CVS and Walgreens managed to remain in the Top Ten by diversifying their offerings and having generally large footprints. Rite Aid fell from number 29 on last year’s list to number 40 this year, with a 22% decline in sales.

Meanwhile, electronics buyers are holding onto their smartphones, televisions and other devices longer, leading to a longer use cycle and fewer trips to the store. Thus, Best Buy, the country’s largest electronics retailer, saw a 5% drop in U.S. sales (to $38.1 billion) and fell two places to number 18.

Discretionary spending on pets has also leveled off after spiking during the pandemic. PetSmart experienced only a 1% growth in retail sales, while Petco saw a 2% decline. (Online retailer Chewy, meanwhile, saw a 6% increase, suggesting some of the shift may be toward online shopping, particularly as both PetSmart and Petco also had declining store locations.)",https://brand-innovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Walmart-Associate-Lauren-smiling.png,N,,2025-07-15 13:25:20.287545

CEO Brian Niccol said the common days will be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The mandate will be applied to the company's Seattle and Toronto Support Centres, as well as regional offices in North America.

""We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams. In February we asked all vp+ leaders working remotely to begin relocating to Seattle or Toronto,"" Niccol said in the announcement.

""We are now extending this requirement to all Support Center people leaders who will be expected to be based in Seattle or Toronto within 12 months.""

The CEO acknowledged that the company's updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.

""If you decide you want to leave Starbucks for any reason, we respect that,"" he said. ""To support those who decide to 'opt out,' we're offering a one-time voluntary exit programme with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.""

Re-establishing in-office culture

Starbucks joins the growing list of organisations mandating more office days for employees after the COVID-19 pandemic made working from home and other flexible working arrangements necessary.

In addition to more on-site days, Niccol said hiring for future roles and lateral moves will require employees to be Seattle- or Toronto-based.

According to the CEO, employees working on-site are able to share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster.

It also helps the company strengthen its culture at a time when it is seeking to revitalise the company's weaker earnings and sales declines.

""We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,"" Niccol said. ""We've listened and thought carefully. But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.""",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/035/0365_638881405921743751.png,N,,2025-07-15 16:14:00.086917

For her, the best entries stood out when their purpose addressed a real problem and delivered commercial impact. She also noted that while AI was used in some campaigns, it didn’t take center stage.

Read more about Sapna’s reflection judging the Innovation Lions this year:

Purpose addressing real problems

“The best work stood out when purpose solves a real problem and has a commercial pay out. It’s not the time anymore of purpose for the sake of it. Doing good must be good for business,” Sapna said.

She also noted that the scale of impact of some of the work was remarkable, as she added, “Even at an early stage, the potential scalability was impressive to see how it can make a change to society and be good for business.”

AI not taking the spotlight at this year’s Cannes Lions

Although there were entries who used artificial intelligence, for Sapna, creativity still stood out.

“AI was not the hero of Cannes Lions 2025, creativity was. The use of AI was ubiquitous, but not front and center. There is definitely more maturity in this space as is visible in the work. The hype seems to be subsiding with the technology in the background and in service of the solution,” Sapna reflected.

She also gave an advance on solving big problems without heavily relying on technology, but rather using creativity, “My advice? Solve big problems, do it with creativity, and with technology being endemic to the solution.”

Together, they identified three themes shaping the future of our industry:

The evolution of purpose

There are brands that attach themselves to a purpose as an accessory, or add-on, to drive awareness of a cause. And then there are brands that weave purpose into the very core of their organization. Brands are moving beyond tokenistic nods to social good towards truly impactful platforms that integrate purpose into every aspect of their organization and operations, and as a result, deliver true commercial impact over a sustained period of time.

Suncorp’s “Building a More Resilient Australia” is a good example — it won Silver in this category. Suncorp is a purpose-driven organization but its resilience initiatives deliver value to its customers, and as a result, value back to the business. By embedding purpose at the core of its organization, Suncorp has increased market share, consideration uplifts, and customer lifetime value.

Sponsor

From ads to ecosystems

Today’s most transformative creative ideas extend far beyond advertising. They impact everything from commercial models to supply chains, legal contracts, suppliers, patents and stakeholders — in other words, the entire ecosystem that supports products and services.

Two examples include AXA’s “Three Words” campaign, which won the Grand Prix, and Heineken’s “Backing the Bars,” which won Bronze. Changing AXA’s most popular home insurance product meant engaging its legal department, overhauling its commercial model, aligning internal stakeholders, assessing liability risk. It represents a system overhaul that sets the benchmark for organizational change. As for “Backing the Bars,” this idea secures Heineken’s customer base by supporting the stakeholders and bar owners who stock their product — in other words, it’s a platform that caters to the entire ecosystem that supports Heineken products with campaigns like “Shutter Ads” and “Starring Bars.”

Driving category reinvention

This year’s most transformative ideas didn’t just grow brands; they redefined entire categories. By reframing consumer expectations and changing the rules of engagement, brands are emerging as leaders in the categories they are redefining.

A good example is Renault’s “Long-Term.” As a pioneer of EVs, Renault set out to grow the market by removing every mental barrier to EV adoption. This five-year evolution is so much more than a brand platform — it’s a reconfiguration of Renault’s brand and business ecosystem towards inclusion, with creativity driving both market expansion and social value, benefiting not only Renault, but the entire category.

Hugo has been in use in Europe since 2022 and was recently recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as one of 11 surgical robots set to be used across the UK National Health Service (NHS).

While Hugo is not yet available in the US, Medtronic’s submission for a urology indication for the robot is currently under review with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with US market entry expected later this year.

In anticipation of Hugo’s approval with the FDA, Medtronic is currently building out its training provision for the RAS system following the introduction of live streaming to its Touch Surgery Ecosystem (TSE) last year. The broad aim of Medtronic’s surgical training provision is to enhance and democratise surgical education on a global scale, removing barriers to training such as geographic location.

With its da Vinci surgical robot, Intuitive Surgical currently holds the largest share of the global robotic surgery market at almost 60%, according to GlobalData analysis. The market is forecast to reach a valuation of $9.2bn by 2034, up from around $2.9bn in 2024.

Due to Medtronic’s size, the Hugo is expected to pose the main challenge to Intuitive’s da Vinci robot once the former is approved in the US.",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/07/shutterstock_1528056221.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 13:26:27.038303

The financial giant's 17% surge in Net Interest Income (NII) to $1.14 billion and a 7% rise in fee revenue highlight strategic execution across core businesses. Pair this with a robust capital base, a dividend hike, and advancements in crypto custody and AI-driven efficiency, and BNY Mellon emerges as a compelling ""Buy"" for investors seeking both stability and growth.

The NII and Fee Revenue Engine

BNY Mellon's Q2 results were anchored by its interest-sensitive assets, which benefited from stable Federal Reserve rates (4.25-4.5%) and disciplined balance sheet management. The net interest margin (NIM) expanded to 1.30%, up 11 basis points year-over-year, reflecting efficient asset allocation. This growth underscores BNY's ability to capitalize on rising yields without overexposure to credit risk.

Meanwhile, fee revenue rose 7% year-over-year, driven by cross-border payment services, issuer services (up 17%), and increased FX trading volumes. The Securities Services segment, which now manages $55.8 trillion in assets under custody, saw fee income grow 3%, while global expansion—particularly in Asia and the Middle East—added momentum.

Capital Strength: A Defensive Shield

BNY Mellon's capital ratios remain a bulwark against volatility. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio held steady at 1i1.5%, exceeding regulatory requirements, while the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 116% and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) of 132% signal resilience. These metrics, combined with a 13% dividend increase to $0.53 per share (yielding 2.8%), position BNY as a top-tier income play.

The company's commitment to shareholder returns is clear: $1.2 billion was returned via dividends and buybacks year-to-date, maintaining a 92% payout ratio.

Crypto Custody and AI: Growth Catalysts

BNY Mellon's strategic initiatives in digital assets and artificial intelligence (AI) are key to its long-term trajectory. Its Eliza AI platform, now adopted by 96% of employees, supports 66 enterprise solutions—up from 45 in 2024. This AI-driven efficiency is boosting cross-selling, with 40% more clients using multiple BNY services.

In crypto custody, BNY's role as custodian for Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin reserves and Circle's USDC highlights its leadership in institutionalizing digital assets. While specifics on new crypto offerings were sparse, BNY's $55.8 trillion custody portfolio and partnerships with fintech innovators suggest a roadmap for growth in this space.

Near-Term Risks and Why They're Manageable

BNY Mellon isn't without challenges. Non-performing loans rose 11% year-over-year to $251 million, signaling potential credit quality risks if the economy weakens. Meanwhile, non-interest expenses increased 5.3% to $3.25 billion, driven by tech upgrades and inflation.

However, these costs are offset by operational leverage (495 basis points expansion) and efficiency savings of $500 million projected for 2025. Management's focus on cost discipline and geographic diversification (e.g., tripling currencies for cross-border payments) mitigates downside risks.

Why BNY Mellon Deserves a ""Buy""

BNY Mellon's Q2 results underscore a diversified revenue model, strong capitalization, and strategic investments in AI and digital assets. While near-term expenses and credit risks warrant monitoring, the company's fortress balance sheet and dividend stability make it a defensive yet growth-oriented play.

At a 4.3% discount to its $94 consensus price target and with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), BNY Mellon is poised to outperform peers in volatile markets.

China’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.2% in April to June compared with a year earlier, slowing from 5.4% in the first quarter, but just ahead of analysts’ expectations for a rise of 5.1%.

The world’s second largest economy has so far avoided a sharp slowdown in part due to support by Beijing and as factories took advantage of a US-China trade truce to make shipments before tariffs kicked in, or “front-loading”.

However, investors are bracing for a weaker second half as exports lose momentum, prices continue to fall, and consumer confidence remains low.

Last month, the US and China extended the truce after two days of talks in London that resulted in a “framework” deal over export restrictions on rare earths and semiconductors.

Washington and Beijing have until 12 August to renew that deal or face a return to the staggering bilateral tariffs that risked introducing a virtual embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies.

China’s economy is heavily dependent on exports, and the US is its biggest market. In recent years, companies have moved their supply chains outside China in an attempt to avoid tariffs, and Chinese businesses have also been developing non-US markets. But no country can replace the purchasing power of US consumers.

The trade war has spread into non-tariff measures, such as restrictions on rare earths exports, causing manufacturing slowdowns for western carmakers.

China’s policymakers face a daunting task in achieving the annual growth target of about 5% – a goal many analysts view as ambitious given entrenched deflation and weak demand at home.

Wei Yao, an economist at Société Générale, said: “Despite a strong first half, the outlook is set to sour in [the second half of the year] as export front-loading fades and the impact of US tariffs becomes more visible.

“Renewed weakness in house prices and the fading impact of subsidies also cast doubt over the sustainability of the consumption recovery.”

Indeed, the solid headline GDP numbers held little sway for most households including Mallory Jiang, a 30-year-old doctor in the southern tech hub Shenzhen, who told Reuters she and her husband had pay cuts this year.

“Both our incomes as doctors have decreased, and we still don’t dare buy an apartment. We are cutting back on expenses: commuting by public transport, eating at the hospital cafeteria or cooking at home. My life pressure is still actually quite high.”

On a quarterly basis, GDP grew 1.1% in April to June, the National Bureau of Statistics data showed, compared with a forecast 0.9% increase and a 1.2% gain in the previous quarter.

Investors are closely watching for signs of fresh stimulus at the upcoming politburo meeting due in late July, which is likely to shape economic policy for the remainder of the year.

Beijing has ramped up infrastructure spending and consumer subsidies, alongside monetary easing. In May, the central bank cut interest rates and injected liquidity as part of broader efforts to cushion the economy from US tariffs.

Some analysts believe the government could increase deficit spending if growth slows sharply.

(SLP) reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, which expanded 66.7% year over year. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents per share.

Quarterly revenues jumped 10% year over year to $20.4 million, driven by continued momentum across its software and services business segments, along with a $2.4 million boost from the Pro-ficiency acquisition. In June 2024, SLP acquired Pro-ficiency to expand into clinical operations, leveraging its science, technology and predictive analytics to help clients reduce clinical trial failures. This deal doubled its total addressable market (TAM) and set up for strong growth, as better use of predictive tech is seen as key to improving drug development.

However, organic revenue fell 4%, mainly due to reduced QSP/QST software sales and a decline in its biosimulation services revenue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue was pegged at $19.5 million.

One of the most important developments during the quarter was the company’s strategic reorganization. Simulations Plus transitioned from a business unit structure to a functionally-driven operating model, completing a multi-year transformation aimed at streamlining operations, unlocking cross-team synergies and focusing resources on high-growth areas. This restructuring also involved adjusting staffing levels and revamping service capacity to better match current client needs, an important step toward scalability and operational efficiency.

Furthermore, SLP announced a $1 million investment in Nurocor, a cloud-based software company transforming the clinical development process for pharmaceutical companies. The investment is being made under the Simulations Plus Corporate Development Initiative, launched in 2024. This initiative targets early-stage technology companies with strong growth potential and disruptive capabilities within pharma and biotech.

The clinical trial technology and services sector was estimated at $25.7 billion in 2024, with a projected CAGR of 15.5% from 2025 to 2030. This growth is driven by the rising adoption of digital health technologies, increasing pressure to streamline trial processes and the need for faster and more efficient patient recruitment. With Nurocor's digital platform and SLP’s modeling and simulation capabilities, both companies are well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of this growing market.

Despite macroeconomic challenges affecting client behavior, the company remains committed to innovation. A major focus moving forward will be a suite of new AI-driven capabilities being integrated across its product lines. By incorporating AI into its core offerings, the company aims to differentiate itself in a competitive market and strengthen its leadership in model-informed drug development—a methodology increasingly adopted by regulators and pharmaceutical companies alike.

Following the announcement, SLP’s shares went up 3% in trading and closed the session at $17.47 on July 14, 2025. Shares of the company have lost 41.5% in the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Software industry's growth of 16.3%.

SLP’s Quarter in Details

Fiscal third-quarter revenues from Software (62% of total quarterly revenues) rose 6% year over year to $12.6 million, led by continued adoption of its ADMET Predictor, with GastroPlus and MonolixSuite also contributing positively. However, the segment saw headwinds from declining QSP/QST biosimulation software usage. GastroPlus, MonolixSuite, ADMET Predictor, Pro-ficiency and QSP/QST products contributed 56%, 17%, 20%, 3% and 4%, respectively, to total software revenues. SLP added 18 new customers and had eight upsells in the fiscal quarter for MonolixSuite.

The renewal rate for commercial customers was 71% (based on accounts) and 84% (based on fees) compared with 86% and 93% in the prior-year quarter, respectively.

Services’ revenues (38%) improved 17% to $7.7 million, driven largely by Medical Communications services, despite other areas within the segment experiencing softness. These weaknesses were attributed to cautious spending, delayed projects and cancellations from BioPharma clients, reflecting broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Sales of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetics and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology saw declines of 10% and 22% year over year, respectively.

SLP maintains a solid pipeline of service projects, though the pace of contractual commitments slowed in the third quarter. Additionally, some backlog work has been deferred to future periods. The company closed the quarter with a backlog of $20.7 million, up from $20.4 million in the previous quarter and $15.7 million a year ago.

SLP’s Operating Details

The gross margin in the quarter under review was 64% compared with 71.5% in the prior-year quarter. The Software segment’s gross margin was 80% compared with 88% a year ago. Services’ gross margin was 38%, down from 41%. The overall fall in gross margin was due to a $2 million rise in cost of revenues, with $1.1 million tied to software costs and $0.9 million to service costs.

Total operating expenses (49% of revenues) jumped 667% to $87.3 million. The rise was due to a one-time non-cash impairment charge of $77.2 million, a strategic decision to align the book value of assets with current market valuations.

Loss from operations was $74.2 million against income of $1.9 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA reached $7.4 million, equating to 37% of total revenue, up from 30% in the prior-year quarter.

SLP’s Liquidity

As of May 31, 2025, cash and short-term investments were $28.5 million compared with $21.5 million as of Feb. 28, 2024.

Cash flow from operations in the fiscal third quarter amounted to $8.14 million compared with $5.7 million a year ago.

SLP Cuts Fiscal 2025 Guidance

The Pro-ficiency training platform and Medical Communication services have been significantly affected by market challenges that delayed clinical trial initiations and reduced spending on commercialization, similar to the issues experienced in SLP’s biosimulation segment. As a result, the revenue outlook for these sectors has been lowered for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026.

SLP also faced a major client cancellation this quarter, linked to setbacks in the client’s drug programs, which reduced near-term revenue by approximately $2 million. Along with other challenges, this greatly affected quarterly results and will influence the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2026. The weaker-than-expected services revenue also led to a downward revision of the full-year 2025 guidance.

For fiscal 2025, it now expects revenues to be between $76 million and $80 million, up 9-14% year over year. The prior view was $90-$93 million with an increase of 28-33%. The Pro-ficiency acquisition is now expected to contribute an additional $9-$12 million to revenues compared with $15-$18 million projected earlier. The company continues to expect the Software segment mix to be 55-60% of total revenues.

SLP now estimates adjusted earnings per share to be in the band of 93 cents to $1.06 and adjusted EBITDA margin between 23% and 27%. Earlier, it projected earnings per share to be between $1.07 and $1.20 and adjusted EBITDA margin between 31% and 33%.

Japanese market challenges prompt overseas innovation push

This expansion is a direct response to demographic challenges in Japan, where the shrinking life insurance market necessitates growth from new businesses, capital-light ventures, platform businesses, welfare benefits, and overseas expansion.

Dai-ichi Life, founded in 1902 and listed in 2010 to facilitate global expansion, currently operates in 10 markets, including being the largest life insurer in Australia, a top 15 player in the United States, and a top foreign player in Vietnam.

A significant challenge for Japanese financial institutions establishing tech centres in India has been cultural and language differences. Dai-ichi Life is proactively addressing this, recognising it as a “critical journey”. Stephen Barnham noted that companies successfully bridging this gap will gain a “tremendous competitive advantage”.

Capgemini facilitates GCC through build-operate-transfer model

Capgemini established the GCC in a build-operate-transfer model.

Stephen said Capgemini helped the company in building bridges, navigating cultural and language differences between Japan and India. This support is particularly important given that Japan’s similar time zone but different language and culture pose different challenges, utilising Capgemini’s bilingual and bicultural teams in the two countries.

“Plans are in place to send staff from Japan to India and vice versa to foster cross-cultural understanding and communication. This is part of a rotation system to educate and develop talent, helping them learn other languages and cultures,” he said.

The partnership aims to co-innovate solutions that streamline operations, leverage data analytics and artificial intelligence, strengthen cybersecurity defences, and enhance the customer experience for Dai-ichi Life Group.

A new memo from CEO Brian Niccol was recently shared with workers outlining Starbucks’ RTO policy update, and employees are decidedly upset by the increasing emphasis on in-person work. Starbucks’ return to office mandate requires corporate workers to come into the office four days a week, but the change will not be enforced immediately.

The new Starbucks 4-day office policy will go into effect in October, so employees have some time to make adjustments while the offices also prepare for the influx of workers. The coffee giant expanded on its in-person policy in October last year, demanding that workers adhere to the three-day requirement for in-office work or face the consequences, which included the risk of being fired. The latest RTO mandate from Starbucks has similar implications, as workers who resist the change can expect some harsh consequences.

Starbucks’ RTO policy of spending 4 days a week in the office is particularly infuriating for many due to the flexibility CEO Niccol enjoys in working remotely from his home in Newport Beach.

New Starbucks RTO Mandate Requires Employees to Come In Four Days a Week

Starting in October, Starbucks’ corporate employees will be required to work from the office four days a week instead of three. Those who do not want to comply can volunteer to take the company’s offer of a cash payment to leave in silence through the exit program that has been made available to them. Similar to every other company that has pushed for a return to the office, the Starbucks RTO program is being rolled out to increase in-person collaboration and problem-solving, which organizations believe is the true path to productivity. In the notice shared on the company website, CEO Niccol shared that:

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

The CEO acknowledged that many employees will need to travel to different locations for work or may need to step out to take care of their personal needs, however, the company culture’s default must be set to working in person alongside their teams. Starbucks and other businesses, such as Target, Intel, and Uber, have determined that real collaboration cannot occur online; working face-to-face is essential to maintain their momentum of progress.

Starbucks’ 4-Day Office Policy Also Comes with Relocation Mandates

The Starbucks RTO policy doesn’t just require workers to come in 4 days a week, but also requires Support Center “people leaders” to look into relocating to Toronto and Seattle within 12 months. Earlier in the year, the company had required some of its senior leaders to move closer to the organization’s main centers, and it appears that more employees will have to make a similar change in the coming months.

Starbucks’ turnaround plan has made its stance on remote work quite clear, with the CEO elaborating that future hiring and lateral promotions for such positions will also require partners to be based in Seattle or Toronto. The shift away from remote work is no longer surprising, but it still has employees frustrated at the change.

The “Back to Starbucks” Turnaround Plan Has Been Extremely Controversial

Ever since the ex-CEO of Chipotle, Brian Niccol, took on the role of the CEO of Starbucks, the company has been working on its expansive “Back to Starbucks” strategy with full vigor, making innumerable changes to how the business operates. To increase foot traffic at its many locations and turn Starbucks outlets into community hubs instead of quick pit stops, the company has begun transforming how it operates by emphasizing the importance of its employees.

Certain aspects of the strategy, such as the new dress code and the current RTO policy, have been met with resistance, while other aspects, such as the emphasis on internal promotions and the offering of improved benefits, have been received positively. The double standards seen with CEO Niccol’s own freedom to work from home have been particularly frustrating for employees. The CEO was given the freedom to work from his California residence, with the provision of the company jet to travel to Seattle when necessary. Reports now indicate that he has a new home in Seattle, but it’s unclear if he will be required to come into office with a similar frequency as the employees.

Starbucks’ 4-day office policy may still give the illusion of a hybrid work model, but it is likely that this too will change in the coming years, with a complete switch to in-person work. The many benefits of remote work have enthralled workers over the last four years, but the flexibility is fast disappearing, despite its many advantages. Organizations that still offer remote or hybrid work opportunities enjoy an obvious advantage in the market right now, as it is among the most sought-after benefits among job seekers, but it is an offering that is fast disappearing.",https://www.thehrdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Starbucks-RTO.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 14:21:30.890332

(Reuters) -Albertsons raised its annual sales forecast and beat first-quarter estimates on Tuesday, leaning on its competitive pricing strategy to ensure steady demand for essentials at its grocery stores and pharmacies despite inflationary pressures.

While the rest of the retail sector struggles with weak demand, U.S. grocers such as Albertsons and Kroger are attracting value-conscious shoppers, helping them raise their annual forecasts for same-store sales.

However, shares of Albertsons fell about 6% as it left its annual adjusted profit outlook unchanged, with first-quarter gross margin dropping to 27.1% from 27.8% a year ago, due to higher delivery and handling costs and investments.

""The main concern remains the company's ability to manage inflationary overhead expense including labor costs, while reinvesting back into customer value proposition and narrowing competitive price gaps,"" said Michael Montani, analyst with Evercore ISI.

Several companies, including retail giant Walmart, have refrained from issuing forecasts or pulled them back owing to tariff pressures and uncertain consumer spending.

Albertsons now expects annual identical sales to grow between 2% and 2.75%, compared with its prior range of 1.5% to 2.5%.

To keep retail prices on check, CEO Susan Morris said on a post-earnings conference call the grocer has invested in loyalty programs, targeted promotions and leaned more on its private-label products.

For the first quarter, identical sales rose 2.8% compared to 1.4% increase a year ago, on strong growth in pharmacy sales.

""Grocery store pharmacies are gaining from closures of traditional drugstores, while more people are buying fresh food as a cheaper, healthier alternative to dining out or consuming snacks,"" said Arun Sundaram, analyst with CFRA Research.

Albertsons' quarterly sales of $24.88 billion, edged past analysts' estimates of $24.73 billion, as per LSEG data, while its adjusted profit of 55 cents per share beat estimates of 53 cents.

PC makers shipped a total of 63,225 million units in the March-June quarter, a rise of 4.4 per cent as compared to 60,541 million units in the corresponding quarters a year ago, according to Gartner’s preliminary report.

“In the second quarter of 2025, enterprise demand outpaced consumer demand, underpinned by Windows 11 migrations and pandemic-era desktop renewals, while consumer refreshes slowed as buyers deferred purchases,” said Rishi Padhi, Research Principal at Gartner.

Lenovo remained the top contributor in terms of volume in global shipment, holding 26.9 per cent market share, followed by HP Inc (22.3 per cent), Dell (15.6 per cent) and Apple (9 per cent).

“There were no major changes in the top five vendor rankings worldwide in the second quarter of 2025; meanwhile, Lenovo saw a decent growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9 per cent YoY,” the report noted.

Except Dell, all major manufacturers saw a growth in their shipment varying 3 per cent to 13 per cent. Dell Shipment fell 3 per cent to 9,832 million units as compared to 10,140 million units in Q2 2024.

Lenovo shipped 17,038 million units in Q2 2025, and HP’s shipment stood at 14,124 million units. At the same time, Dell shipped 9,832 million units and Apple’s numbers were 5,699 million units.

Meanwhile, the PC shipment is expected to rise by over 2 per cent in 2025. Various factors like surge in inventory, ongoing Window 11 replacement will contribute in the growth of shipment activities.

“PC shipments are forecast to rise 2.4% in 2025, propelled by a tariff-driven front-loaded inventory surge in the first half of 2025 in the U.S., and ongoing Windows 11 replacement cycles in the rest of the world,” said Padhi.

In the second half of 2025, shipment growth is expected to plateau as vendors draw down stock in response to demand, potentially creating excess inventory by year-end, he added.

Latest closures include locations in Deep River, Hamilton, Sioux Lookout and Scarborough

Ten more Beer Store locations across Ontario will be closing down effective Sept. 14.

Its the latest reduction announcement, as dozens of other locations have closed since the beginning of the year.

""This is not an easy decision and not one we make lightly,"" said Ozzie Ahmed, vice president of retail for the Beer Store.

""All efforts will be made to support employees through this process in alignment with commitments and agreements,"" he said.

While Ahmed says the business has had to close some locations to adapt to the province's changing beer retail market, an expert says it's a sign that the Beer Store is making ""a slow and painful departure.""

""It's certainly putting the writing on the wall that there doesn't seem to be a plan in place to save them ... There doesn't seem to be any new strategy or innovation on the horizon to save the remaining stores,"" said Lisa Hutcheson, retail strategist at J.C. Williams Group.

A competition with convenience

Access to alcohol and other goods in convenience stores is one factor leading to The Beer Store's reductions, says Hutcheson.

Booze has been readily available in convenience stores across Ontario since Sept. 2024, thanks to a push from Premier Doug Ford's government.

""When you think about The Beer store today it is really just beer and there isn't anything else,"" said Hutcheson, adding the company should've re-strategized to keep stores open years ago.

""There's really nothing interesting about it. There's no experience, there's no customer service. You get your beer and you just leave.""

Hutcheson says the company, which still has hundreds of locations, can still reinvent itself, but that will take time to research and execute.

China declined in Q2 as subsidies failed to stimulate demand. Although the 618 e-commerce festival was a success in terms of sell out, OEMs and channel partners used the promotions to clear inventory rather than increase shipments. While Apple was the top brand during the promotion period, it saw a 1% drop in China in Q2, offset by strong double-digit growth in emerging markets leading to a 1.5% growth globally in the quarter.”

“Samsung was able to consolidate its market leadership and outperform the overall market achieving strong growth in the quarter driven by the sales of its new Galaxy A36 and A56 products,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president, Client Devices, IDC. “These new products introduce AI-enabled features to mid-range devices, which has been effectively used in retail stores to drive sales, as more consumers become curious about AI.”

“In the face of ongoing political challenges, the impact of war, and the complexities posed by tariffs, the 1% growth in the smartphone market stands as a critical indicator that the market is poised to return to growth,” said Anthony Scarsella, research director for Client Devices, IDC. “Q2 was packed with new models, featuring innovative designs and the powerful integration of AI, which drove the 8th consecutive quarter of growth — a feat we have not witnessed since 2013.”

Bloomberg declared, “Big Business Is Abandoning Its Climate Goals” while the Harvard Business Review offered that “Corporate Sustainability Is in Crisis.” A venture capital blog asked, “Is Corporate Sustainability Dead?”

Meanwhile, self-appointed watchdogs and critics on social media weigh in daily with their own bill of particulars: stalled progress, lowered ambition, missed targets, greenwashing, greenhushing, hypocrisy. Pushback and constructive criticism are welcome, of course, but these pundits seem almost giddy and gloating in pointing out the shortcomings they see.

Together, they make a compelling case that corporate sustainability is circling the drain.

Except, it isn’t.

Against the tide

To be sure, there’s a kernel of truth in the headlines. Walmart and Coca-Cola are among several big companies acknowledging they’ll miss key climate emissions targets, while some other firms’ goals have simply “lost their meaning.” Banking giants such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have exited international net-zero finance groups. Anti-ESG backlash, especially in the U.S., remains real and ferocious. Several of the world’s most powerful companies, including some sustainability leaders, are pumping millions into trade associations actively obstructing climate policy.

But to declare corporate sustainability dead — or even dying — is to fundamentally misunderstand both the movement and the moment.

What we’re witnessing is a recalibration — an evolution of terminology, tone and tactics in response to a complex and pugnacious political and economic environment. Sustainability isn’t fading away. It’s simply gotten smarter, quieter, more embedded and, in many respects, more effective.

“There’s more rigor, more skepticism, much better data and a sharper focus on results than there was five or 10 years ago,” noted Jeffrey Hogue, CSO at Levi Strauss & Co, in a recent LinkedIn post. “It’s become clear that real progress requires committed, consistent work that prioritizes impact, addresses the real-world implications of our operations and aligns with long-term business strategies.”

Even so-called “greenhushing” — companies keeping mum about their sustainability efforts to thwart criticism — misses the point. As another chief sustainability officer told me, “We’re talking less, but we’re doing more.” The real work is happening away from the klieg lights of public scrutiny: integrating sustainability into core strategy and focusing on risk management, supply-chain resilience and operational excellence.

A hero’s journey

Why is the doom-loop meme so compelling? As the cognitive linguist George Lakoff tells us, our perspectives are shaped by mental structures — frames — that help us make sense of complexity. The idea that big business is fundamentally about greed, and that sustainability initiatives are essentially a fig leaf, is a comfortable frame that fits with public skepticism about capitalism itself. It’s a deep story, to borrow sociologist Arlie Hochschild’s phrase, about what’s gone wrong in society and who’s to blame.

It’s also a story that’s easy to tell from the cheap seats. Critics from across the political spectrum seem to love tossing brickbats at companies for perceived sustainability missteps, often without acknowledging the sheer scale and difficulty of what’s being attempted: Decarbonize and detoxify supply chains, eliminate plastic waste, create circular material flows — all without affecting profits? That’s a hero’s journey, replete with the requisite dragons: shrinking budgets, shifting regulations, sclerotic bureaucracies and the ever-present specter of blowback.

Doing the hard work has never been harder.

What the data show

Here’s what the headlines don’t say: Most companies are not abandoning climate action. According to PwC’s 2025 State of Decarbonization report, while 16 percent are reducing their commitments, 37 percent are strengthening them. The number of firms setting climate targets is nine times higher than five years ago.

Moreover, the doom-loop meme represents a largely U.S.-centric view. A growing number of Asian businesses are embedding sustainability into core operations, driven by stricter regulations and investor expectations, according to India-based credibl. China plans to introduce carbon footprint accounting rules and standards for key industrial products, according to Reuters. Similarly, Latin American companies are increasingly integrating sustainability into their strategies and operations.

While the U.S. obsesses over the perceived horror of “woke” corporations, the rest of the world is quietly getting on with the work of building a low-carbon economy. Outside the U.S., ESG might as well stand for Economics, Security and Geopolitics.

Resting in peace

In recent months, some longtime observers have been asking: What parts of the corporate sustainability agenda should we be hospicing?

Yes, hospicing — that’s their word.

The notion that parts of a CSO’s remit should be laid to rest may be unsettling, but it’s worth pondering, Justin Adams, co-founder of the Ostara Collective, a multidisciplinary group seeking to “build a holistic vision for our evolving economies,” told me recently.

“One of the mistakes we have made in the sustainability world is believing either that the system is naturally going to change or that people are motivated to want the type of change that is needed,” said Adams, whose résumé includes stints at BP, the World Economic Forum and The Nature Conservancy. “We’re just doing what we’ve always done for 30 or 40 years, which clearly is not working.”

Voluntary certifications and reporting frameworks that don’t drive real change? Let them go, says Adams. So should anything else that doesn’t contribute to a positive impact.

“What matters now is materiality — focusing on the issues that truly move the needle for both business and society,” he said. What stands to emerge is a more mature, honest and impactful approach.

Progress, not perfection

To Adams’ point, the pace of change is way too slow. Several sectors — chemicals, food and ag, and apparel, among others — seem unwilling or unable to embrace sustainability beyond pilot projects and small-ball initiatives. The systemic conventions undergirding all companies — quarterly reporting, the short shelf life of CEOs, investor expectations of never-ending growth — aren’t exactly going away.

So, let’s not confuse recalibration with retreat. The forces that sparked corporate sustainability are here to stay and becoming ever more urgent. The real story isn’t about the demise of sustainability but about its messy, necessary evolution. The work is hard, the journey long and the stakes couldn’t be higher.

The new EPD demonstrates that the embodied carbon of Tyvek® HomeWrap is about 7 percent lower as a result of purchasing the RECs.","The world is not on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at a pace rapid enough to keep temperature increase within the +1.5 degree Celsius limit, and the built environment—which accounts for over 34 percent of global GHG emissions—has a significant role to play.

DuPont, where sustainability is integral to strategy, is tackling this problem through innovation driven by Environmental Product Declarations, or EPDs.

To lower the carbon footprint of a product, it’s first crucial to understand the numbers behind it—and EPDs are the best way to do that.

Calculated through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), EPDs have emerged as the standardized way to share a product’s carbon footprint in the building and construction industry.

The process of creating or updating an EPD makes it clear where the carbon hot spots are in a product and therefore informs innovation opportunities DuPont could pursue to reduce that product’s embodied carbon.

“The magic is in crunching the numbers,” said Global Sustainability Director, DuPont Performance Building Solutions & Corian® Design, Shawn Hunter. He said that the company is looking for those “big levers:” the biggest innovation opportunities to reduce a product’s embodied carbon.

EPDs help companies like DuPont identify the changes that will have the most significant impact.

“The numbers matter,” Hunter said. “If you’re able to pair your decarbonization intentions with really good analysis and informed decisions, then you know you’re going to be actually driving the greatest impact. It’s pairing a decarbonization intention, which we know needs to happen much faster than it actually is, with a tool that can guide those decisions.”

Through the process of getting an EPD, DuPont found three big levers it can use to reduce embodied carbon in its products:

Purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs)

Changing the raw material used in the product

Exploring alternative energy sources

These insights have led to product innovation. Take Tyvek® HomeWrap: Through the LCA, DuPont realized that the company could reduce the product’s overall embodied carbon by considering the above levers.

“We now have the ability to apply a renewably attributed raw material to the Tyvek, and we can understand how that will impact the embodied carbon,” Hunter said, adding that they have been able to do the same with REC purchases for Tyvek® HomeWrap.

The Tyvek® HomeWrap’s updated EPD has just been released. The new EPD demonstrates that the embodied carbon of Tyvek® HomeWrap is about 7 percent lower as a result of purchasing the RECs. Building on this progress, DuPont is exploring the opportunity to offer a raw material decarbonization opportunity to customers who may be interested in a renewably attributed solution.

The demand for EPDs is rising: Not only will increased regulations in places like California and Europe require EPDs, but both companies like DuPont and homebuilders like Taylor Morrison want to understand the carbon footprint of the products they are using so that they can achieve future reduction goals.

“We’ve been doing our greenhouse gas inventory for a couple of years now, and it’s just something that we want to continually get better at,” said Taylor Morrison Director of Sustainability Chad Eby. “It’s important to have a good baseline, because you can’t improve what you’re not measuring.”

Not only can EPDs provide these numbers, but they drive innovation along the way so that DuPont’s products can further support the building industry in its decarbonization journey.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/featured-image-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 12:34:43.121409

Desbaillets and Wong Ai Ai were on the side that opposed CDL executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng, while Ong and Yeo were elder Kwek’s allies.
Yeo was the former executive chairman and subsequently executive co-chairman of Economic Development Board between 1986 and 2006.
After exiting CDL’s board, Yeo will remain on the board of 20 other companies, including IndoFood Agri Resources, QAF and Sunway.","[SINGAPORE] City Developments Ltd (CDL) announced the retirement of Philip Yeo, who notably backed executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng’s bitter boardroom battle against his son, chief executive officer Sherman Kwek, in early 2025.

Having served the board for 16 years since May 2009, Yeo “has given notice of his retirement as a non-independent non-executive director of CDL”, said the property group in a bourse filing on Tuesday (Jul 15).

His departure comes three months after CDL’s annual general meeting (AGM), when he vocally rallied shareholders against “bullying” by majority directors.

At the AGM, Yeo openly urged shareholders to reject the re-election of four directors, comprising of two new appointees Jennifer Young and Wong Su Yen, and two independents Daniel Desbaillets and Wong Ai Ai. His objections centred on governance lapses, notably that Young and Wong Su Yen’s appointments on Feb 7 bypassed the nominating committee – a key point in the elder Kwek’s original lawsuit against CEO Sherman Kwek, which erupted on Feb 26.

Yeo’s critique during the AGM, including his remark that directors should be appointed “unanimously, not by majority bullying”, drew loud applause from attending shareholders, underscoring lingering divisions despite the family’s subsequent public truce.

The family feud started to subside after a major turning point on Mar 4, when the property giant announced the “irrevocable resignation” of Catherine Wu as an unpaid independent adviser to CDL’s hotel arm, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels. Wu’s long relationship with Kwek Leng Beng had caused the rift within the CDL group.

Kwek Leng Beng issued a statement on Mar 12 saying that he would drop the lawsuit against Sherman Kwek, and all the board members had agreed to put aside their differences for the greater good of CDL and its stakeholders.

Nonetheless, the majority of the shareholders in the April AGM were in favour of the re-election of Young and Wong Su Yen, the two new independent directors. Resolutions were also passed at the AGM for the re-election of three retiring independent directors – Colin Ong, Desbaillets and Wong Ai Ai. Desbaillets and Wong Ai Ai were on the side that opposed CDL executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng, while Ong and Yeo were elder Kwek’s allies.

Yeo was the former executive chairman and subsequently executive co-chairman of Economic Development Board between 1986 and 2006. He was also formerly a special adviser for economic development in the Prime Minister’s Office from 2007 to 2011. After exiting CDL’s board, Yeo will remain on the board of 20 other companies, including IndoFood Agri Resources, QAF and Sunway.

The study notes that leasing is now responsible for over 50% of new car registrations in Europe, a share expected to reach 70% by 2030, with leasing companies, which include subsidiaries of carmakers (e.g. Mobilize for Renault) and banking groups (e.g. Ayvens for Société Générale, Arval for BNP Paribas) having ‘significant power’ in shaping the EV transition.

However, as the study claims, these firms face no binding climate regulations, and provide little transparency on their fleet emissions, or their targets for phasing out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

Climate regulations

“Unlike carmakers, leasing companies are not subject to any specific climate regulations,” commented Lucie Pinson, executive director at Reclaim Finance. “There is currently no requirement for emissions transparency, no binding targets, and no phase-out timeline for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

“It’s hardly surprising, then, that the warning lights are flashing red when it comes to decarbonisation – and that no leasing company has committed to moving away from fossil fuels.”

As the study found, some 12 of the twenty leasing companies analysed – including firms like Mercedes-Benz Financial Services and Toyota Financial Services – do not publicly disclose data specific to their leasing activities, while for the eight that do, the information provided is vague or incomplete.

Some nine leasing companies have climate targets, but these are ‘fragmented, short-term, [and] poorly detailed’, according to the study.

Driving the Day

TRIPLE THREAT — Insurers face a number of pressures that could lead to a jump in out-of-pocket health costs for Americans: cuts to Medicaid, federal policy changes that could hit Obamacare enrollment and medical costs rising faster than expected, Kelly reports.

Several health insurers were already on unstable financial footing even before President Donald Trump signed into law the “big, beautiful bill” — which could lead to millions of people losing coverage. The looming changes now create more uncertainty that could lead to a downturn for the health insurance industry and a jump in premiums for Americans purchasing coverage.

“You have this perfect storm here of very large changes happening all at once,” said Ellen Montz, a managing director with advisory firm Manatt Health and a former CMS official during the Biden administration. “They’re looking at pricing, what is potentially coming down the pike, and we’re going to see some very large, both gross and net, premium increases.”

Both Centene and Molina Healthcare slashed their yearly financial guidance over the past few weeks amid unexpectedly high medical costs in Medicaid and Obamacare plans. And health insurance giant UnitedHealthcare lowered its guidance in May because of higher-than-anticipated Medicare Advantage costs.

“As we see these cost pressures continue to mount, as we see them go unaddressed and continue to snowball in their effect, the inevitable result is that we will see higher premiums,” said David Merritt, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

Why it matters: The Congressional Budget Office estimated that an earlier version of the “big, beautiful bill,” combined with the expiration of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies at the end of this year and new Trump administration Affordable Care Act policies that make it more difficult to enroll, could cause nearly 17 million people to become uninsured.

Cushioning the blow: Insurers are pushing Congress and the Trump administration to mitigate some of the fallout, warning lawmakers in competitive districts that their constituents will face widespread coverage disruptions if the policies are implemented. The industry’s most pressing concern is the expiration of the enhanced subsidies — which Congress must extend within the next few months to avoid “very sudden” and “severe” cost hikes and coverage losses nationwide, said Mike Tuffin, the CEO of health insurance trade group AHIP.

So far, few Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in extending the subsidies, which CBO has estimated at $335 billion over 10 years.

“We know over the last 30 years that when people’s coverage is disrupted, their access to health care is disrupted, there’s an immediate political response, and both parties have seen that in the past, and we want to prevent that,” Tuffin said.

What’s next: Insurers will start posting their 2025 second-quarter earnings over the next few weeks, which will provide some insight into how they might adjust to rising medical costs. It may also shed light on how they’re factoring in looming federal changes to their pricing. First up is Elevance Health, which will report its earnings Thursday.

In Congress

AUTISM SPEAKS ON THE HILL — Advocates from the group Autism Speaks will head to the Capitol today to urge lawmakers to fund recently reauthorized research and service programs in the wake of the GOP megabill’s steep Medicaid cuts.

While the group will acknowledge their concerns about how those cuts could impact autism programs in the states, it plans to focus on the annual appropriations process “since that’s the next thing up, and something that we want to try to ensure that we’re at least maintaining the levels of funding for those programs,” David Sitcovsky, Autism Speaks’ vice president of advocacy, told Lauren.

Congress reauthorized the Autism CARES Act in December, which Autism Speaks says is the primary federal funding source for monitoring, research, services and training programs in the autism community. The law’s programs are spread across the CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the NIH.

The group plans to underscore in their meetings that autism is a lifelong condition — not just a childhood disorder, as often emphasized by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — for which many people need support as they age.

“It seems like most [of the] conversation about autism has been framed around childhood, and and I think what were really trying to do … is to remind people that [it’s a] lifelong issue, and there are many adults who need better understanding and supportive services now,” said Dr. Andy Shih, Autism Speaks’ chief science officer.

At the Agencies

DOC PAY OVERHAUL — The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is proposing a boost in funding to doctors who participate in alternative payment models based on the quality of care delivered instead of individual services, POLITICO’s Robert King reports.

“We’re making it easier for seniors to access preventive services, incentivizing health care providers to deliver real results, and cracking down on abuse that drives up costs,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement Monday when the agency released its proposed physician fee schedule that details changes to Medicare pay for 2026.

What it means: Doctors participating in the models would receive a 3.83 percent boost to their payments starting in 2026. Doctors not participating in such models would get a 3.62 percent increase.

Why it matters: If finalized, the rule would represent a departure from how CMS traditionally reimburses doctors. The agency typically has one rate update that applies to all doctors serving Medicare patients, regardless of whether they participate in an alternative payment model.

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have sought to shift Medicare reimbursement away from payments for individual items or services.

TECH TROUBLES — The Department of Veterans Affairs told a House panel Monday that it has implemented DOGE-directed cuts to optimize its IT infrastructure. But lawmakers say they want assurances that the agency’s past problems with IT modernization won’t be its future, Ruth reports.

“For years, this committee has highlighted the wasteful spending, the overbudget projects, poor outcomes that seem to come with all IT projects at the VA,” said Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Mich.), chair of the House Veterans Affairs’ Technology Modernization Subcommittee.

Since the beginning of the year, the VA’s Office of Information and Technology has lost 1,100 employees — mostly from buy-out and early retirement offers — and its 2026 budget has shaved $500 million from its operating funding. Subcommittee ranking member Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.) said she’s concerned the cuts will undermine the agency’s efforts.

Eddie Pool, the VA’s acting assistant secretary and chief information officer, assured lawmakers that more than three-quarters of the people who left the agency were going to retire soon.

Why it matters: Veterans Affairs is in the midst of its latest attempt to update its IT infrastructure, including its electronic medical records system. The agency has been attempting to modernize since 2001 and has failed to do so multiple times, according to the Government Accountability Office.

Carol Harris, the GAO’s director of IT and cybersecurity, testified that the VA’s IT office hasn’t adequately taken stock of its workforce. For example, she said, it doesn’t have an inventory of employees’ current cybersecurity skills and competencies. The agency also hasn’t comprehensively identified its current and future human capital needs, Harris added.

The GAO has 26 open recommendations for improving the VA’s IT and cybersecurity that it said the office still needs to complete.

What’s next: President Donald Trump recently announced his pick for chief information officer at the VA, Ryan Cote, who served as the Transportation Department’s CIO in the first Trump administration. His confirmation hearing hasn’t been scheduled yet.

Health Costs

MEDICAL DEBT RULE TOSSED OUT — A federal judge has overturned a Biden administration rule that would have removed $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million people, POLITICO’s Katherine Hapgood reports.

U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan of the Eastern District Court in Texas said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule “exceeds the bureau’s statutory authority” and violates the law on permissible purposes of consumer reports. The decision aligns with the Trump administration’s stance on the issue.

The rule was finalized by then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, but the bureau under the Trump administration reversed its position on the rule and joined credit-reporting groups in challenging it. The rule had been set to take effect at the end of July.

Earnings vs. Forecast

Albertsons’ earnings per share of $0.55 aligned with market expectations, showing no surprise in EPS. However, revenue surpassed forecasts by $200 million, indicating stronger-than-expected sales. This positive revenue surprise of 0.81% reflects effective sales strategies, though it wasn’t enough to boost investor confidence in the short term.

Market Reaction

Following the earnings announcement, Albertsons’ stock experienced a pre-market decline of 2.39%, closing at $21.6. This drop is notable given the stock’s 52-week range of $17 to $23.2. The movement suggests cautious investor sentiment despite revenue beats, possibly due to broader market conditions or concerns about future growth potential. InvestingPro analysts maintain a consensus target price range of $20-31, with the stock showing relatively low volatility with a beta of 0.3. The company’s defensive nature is further evidenced by its steady dividend yield of 2.71% and 25% dividend growth over the last twelve months.

Outlook & Guidance

Albertsons updated its FY2025 guidance, projecting identical sales growth between 2.0% and 2.75%. The company also anticipates an adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 to $3.9 billion and an adjusted EPS of $2.10 to $2.16. These projections indicate a moderate growth outlook, with expectations of gradual improvement in grocery units in the latter half of the year.

Conference Operator: Greetings, and welcome to The Albertsons Companies First Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call, and thank you for standing by. All participants will be in a listen only mode until the Q and A session. This call is being recorded. I would like to hand the call over to Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management. Please go ahead, sir.

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for The Albertsons Company’s first quarter twenty twenty five earnings conference call. With me today are Susan Morris, our CEO, and Sharon McCollum, our President and CFO. Today, Susan will recap the first quarter of twenty twenty five and update you on our progress against our strategic priorities. Then, Sharon will provide the details related to our first quarter twenty twenty five financial results and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal twenty twenty five, before handing it back to Susan for closing remarks. After management comments, we will conduct a Q and A session.

I would like to remind you that management may make forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Any forward looking statements we make today are only as of today’s date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non GAAP financial measures.

A reconciliation of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in this morning’s earnings release. And with that, I will hand the call over to Susan.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Thanks, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, our teams delivered solid results with ID sales growth of 2.8%, adjusted EBITDA of $1,110,000,000 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 These results again demonstrate gradual and incremental progress against our five strategic priorities, which include driving customer growth and engagement through digital connection, growing our media collective, enhancing the customer value proposition, modernizing capabilities through technology and driving transformational productivity. Within these priorities, four digital platforms continue to be the catalyst for customer growth and engagement. We continue to drive increased sales and to more deeply engage our most loyal customers, all while generating data and insights for the media collective.

Our first digital platform is e commerce, which grew 25% and reached 9% of total grocery revenue in the first quarter. This growth was again led by strong performance in our first party business, driven by award winning capabilities in our fully integrated mobile app and supported by our five star certification program. Our focus on delivering exceptional customer service experience is fueling new customer acquisition and strengthening existing customer retention. To do this, we’re continuing to enhance our digital shopping experience, including the introduction of AI and interactive features that deliver both ease and convenience. For example, we launched our new shop assist feature, which enables a connected shopping experience that allows customers to communicate back and forth with our in store associates throughout their orders fulfillment process.

We’ve also created more flexibility in our basket building. Customers can now add items to their orders up until picking has started, recognizing that shoppers often think of one more item they need just after an order is placed. While our e commerce penetration is still below industry peers, it is one of our biggest growth customer acquisition and customer retention opportunities for 2025 and beyond. From a profitability perspective, our e commerce business is near breakeven and improving. Our second digital platform is loyalty, which grew 14% to 47,000,000 members in the first quarter as we capitalized on simplification of our program and further enhanced the value the program offers.

Members in the program today are engaging more frequently, using more of our easy to understand and redeem features and spending more with us. As case in point, 30% of our engaged households are now electing the cash off option, reinforcing the customer’s desire for immediate value. As we did last quarter, loyalty is a key enabler of digital customer engagement and a rich source of data for our media collective. Throughout 2025, we will continue to introduce compelling benefits that will attract new members, improve share of wallet and further enable marketing and monetization opportunities for the media collective. We will also continue to simplify and expand the program to include strategic partnerships to offer even more value.

Our third digital platform is Pharmacy and Health, which grew 20% year over year driven by industry leading script and immunization growth, best in class customer satisfaction scores and the ongoing integration of Pharmacy and Sicily Health into our overall digital experience. Cross shoppers between grocery and pharmacy are exceptionally valuable. Over time, these customers visit the store four times more often and buy significantly more groceries with us, resulting in outsized customer lifetime value across the entire store. For this reason, in addition to the market share opportunity competitor closings are creating for us, we are also continuing to invest in our pharmacy and health digital platform. Through this platform, we are also launching customized omni channel benefits that are not only attracting new customers, but also converting existing pharmacy and grocery only customers to become cross shoppers.

It is also helping customers to find new and personalized ways to improve their health and well-being consistent with evolving national trends. Our pharmacy and health platform is an integral part of our Customers for Life strategy and a significant growth and customer engagement opportunity. For this reason, leveraging our growing scale to improve pharmacy profitability over time is a key operational priority. To deliver this, we are continuing to pursue higher margin service offerings and drive productivity through improved sourcing, increased automation and labor optimization. This quarter we opened our third central field processing facility, which is reducing our cost to serve, while at the same time improving overall customer experience.

The fourth digital platform is the integration of the mobile app for use in our stores. We’re not just selling food, we’re simplifying meal planning and making shopping easier and more convenient both in store and online. Our app has become the epicenter of the omni channel experience with digital customers engaging nearly three times a week on average. What began as a tool for enabling e commerce and delivering great deals is now a Swiss army knife of tools that makes customers’ lives easier regardless of whether they’re shopping in our stores or online. These tools include best in class list building and personalized meal planning capabilities, powerful search and product locating capabilities, and an in store mode that connects meal planning and other store specific capabilities.

Intermediate collective in the first quarter, we significantly increased the high impact digital inventory as our digital platforms work together to enrich our data and generate deeper customer engagement to accelerate growth and deliver superior return on ad spend. We’ll continue to invest in building industry leading integrated solutions that will support both endemic and non endemic partners. These solutions include refining shopper audiences, running targeted media campaigns with compressed measurement timelines, and delivering consistent omni execution to develop personalized relationships for our collective partners with our customers. These same solutions are also providing benefits for our internal loyalty and marketing initiatives. As we look forward, we expect the collective to grow faster than the retail media market and ultimately be one of the largest sources of fuel for reinvestment into our core business over time.

To improve our customer value proposition, we intentionally invested in value, in both loyalty and promotional offerings, as well as by partnering with strategic vendors to invest in price in certain categories in certain markets. We also surgically managed through the pass through of cost inflation to further invest in the customer’s needs for immediate value. While it is early, these investments did deliver a sequential quarterly unit sales improvement and over time are expected to drive greater existing and new customer engagement across our banners. We additionally amplified our own brands presence to drive further value for our customers. Own brand sales penetration finished the quarter at 25.7% as we launched new offerings across multiple categories.

We also expanded the assortment in our recently introduced Overjoyed brand and launched our newest brand, Chef’s Towner, a chef inspired meal solution targeting foodies seeking fast and easy restaurant quality choices at affordable prices. These launches coupled with greater prominence and better value in own brand merchandising is expected to drive greater loyalty, increase digital and omni channel household engagement and higher transaction counts over time. Our next priority is the modernization of our capabilities through technology. As we said last quarter, our North Star is to use technology in everything we do and we are energized by the progress we are making toward this aspiration. Our technology first focus is positioning us to make a greater impact faster, allowing us to drive greater innovation at a lower cost.

Our advanced technology platform, on which we are continuing to innovate, powers our e commerce, store, pharmacy, supply chain, merchandising and media collective operations, and is allowing us to leverage emerging AI technologies to accelerate our operational transformation going forward. We are also using our advanced capabilities to use AI agents to enhance many business functions, including pricing and promotion, personalization, customer care, and cogeneration among others. Driving transformational productivity is our next priority, which is an imperative to fuel our growth. Our productivity engine continues to reduce costs, offset headwinds and fund our growth priorities. It works hand in hand with our technology modernization, including our initiatives to leverage AI and data analytics, optimize supply chain costs through automation, and build up shrink and labor management tools to name a few.

In addition, the largest of our opportunities continues to be the leveraging of our consolidated scale to buy goods for resale through national buying and more efficient supplier relationships. As we previously shared from fiscal year twenty twenty five through 2027, we expect our productivity engine to deliver $1,500,000,000 in savings, which we plan to reinvest in growth and our customer value proposition, as well as to offset other inflationary headwinds. Before I hand the call over to Sharon for an overview of our first quarter and to provide an update to our 2025 outlook, I’d like to give you an update on recent labor negotiations. In fiscal twenty twenty five, we have negotiations covering approximately 120,000 associates. As of today, we’ve reached agreement covering nearly half of these associates with two pending ratifications in Colorado and Southern California.

We appreciate and value our associates and in these contracts we are meaningfully improving wages and benefits. At the same time, we’re working to negotiate contracts that are not only financially viable, but also provide the operational flexibility the company needs to streamline operations, manage costs and offer affordable prices in a rapidly changing grocery landscape.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: Sharon, over to you. Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. It’s great to be here with you today. As Susan shared, the investments we are making are delivering value to our customers and adding breadth to the capabilities we need to drive future growth. During the quarter, we saw early wins from these investments affirming our confidence in our strategic priorities and our Customers for Life strategy.

Included in these wins was identical sales growth this quarter of 2.8%, driven by 20% growth in pharmacy and a 25% increase in digital sales. We also saw a sequential improvement in core grocery units. To drive this growth, our gross margin rate of 27.1% was lower than last year by 85 basis points, excluding fuel and LIFO expense. Incremental investments in our customer value proposition and the mix shift impact related to the strong growth in our pharmacy and digital businesses drove this decrease, but was partially offset by benefits driven by our productivity initiatives, including improved shrink expense. Offsetting this gross margin investment was a 63 basis point improvement, excluding fuel, in our selling and administrative expense rate.

This decrease was primarily driven by the leveraging of employee costs, reflecting the positive benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives and lower merger related costs. Interest expense in Q1 twenty five decreased 4,000,000 to 142,000,000 compared to $146,000,000 last year due to lower average borrowings. Income tax expense in the first quarter totaled $75,000,000 or 24.1% compared to $69,000,000 or 22.3% in Q1 last year. This tax rate increase was primarily driven by a reduction of an uncertain tax position last year that did not recur in 2025. Adjusted EBITDA was $1,111,000,000 the first quarter compared to $1,184,000,000 last year.

Adjusted EPS was $0.55 per diluted share compared to $0.66 per diluted share last year. Now I’d like to discuss capital allocation, the balance sheet, and cash flow. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, during the first quarter, we invested $585,000,000 in capital expenditures, including the opening of three new stores and the completion of 36 remodels, as well as the ongoing modernization of our digital and technology capabilities. We also returned $4.00 $1,000,000 to our shareholders, including $86,000,000 in quarterly dividends and $315,000,000 in share repurchases, leaving approximately 1,500,000,000.0 in our existing multi year $2,000,000,000 share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.96.

Now let me walk you through our updated 2025 outlook. As Susan said, we remained focused on our five strategic priorities. Through the balance of fiscal twenty five, we will continue to invest in our customer value proposition, customer experience, digital growth, the media collective, and health and pharmacy. These investments are expected to drive outside growth in digital and pharmacy, both of which drive higher future customer lifetime value, but create near term margin headwinds. We will also continue to drive our productivity agenda to fuel this growth and offset inflationary headwinds.

With that backdrop, we are updating our outlook as follows. We expect identical sales growth in the increased range of two to 2.75%, up from 1.5 to 2.5% last quarter. This assumes continuing growth in pharmacy and digital sales, as well as gradually increasing units in grocery. From a cadence perspective, we expect the second quarter IV sales to be towards the lower end of our guidance range with gradual acceleration in the back half of the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 3,800,000,000.0 to $3,900,000,000 unchanged from last quarter.

As a reminder, this includes approximately $65,000,000 in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter related to our fifty third week. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.3 to $2.16 unchanged from last quarter and including $03 related to the fifty third week. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, unchanged from last quarter, and capital expenditures are expected to be unchanged in the range of 1,700,000,000 to $1,900,000,000 Looking beyond 2025, as we capitalize on the investments we are making behind our strategic priorities, we continue to expect fiscal twenty twenty six to coincide with our long term growth algorithm of two plus percent identical sales and adjusted EBITDA growth higher than that. I will now hand the call back to Susan for closing comments. In closing,

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: our Customers for Life strategy is working. We’re investing in our core operations and improving our customer value proposition. These investments are driving increased traffic and growing digitally engaged customers, omni channel households and loyalty members. To fuel these initiatives, we are driving productivity and leveraging new technologies to drive efficiencies across our operation. As Sharon said, we continue to expect 2025 to be a year of investment, including enhancing our customer value proposition.

As a result, we expect gradual and incremental improvement in top line trends in our grocery business in the second half of twenty twenty five, ultimately driving growth in line with our long term algorithm of 2% plus identical sales and adjusted EBITDA growing higher than that in fiscal year twenty twenty six. With just over two months as CEO of Albertsons Companies, let me say that I am more confident in our strategy with each day. I’m energized by the work our teams are progressing and excited to continue building on our strong foundation. To our 02/5000 great associates, I am more inspired than ever by you and all that you make possible for our customers and our communities each day. No matter where you are across our business, you make a difference.

You keep our systems running, ensure our products are in stock and delight our customers. We will now open the call for questions.

Conference Operator: Thank session. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please proceed with your question.

Paul Lejuez, Analyst, Citi: Hey, thanks guys. Curious if you could talk about the drivers of the gross margin decline this quarter, maybe find them for us, and how we should think about each of them remaining a headwind for the rest of the year, which stay, which might go away, which become less of a headwind? Maybe that you can start with that. And then also curious how you would characterize the pricing environment around you in the competitive landscape. Thanks.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Thanks, Paul. As I think about gross margins, so we’ve been very clear that our top priority is driving sales and specifically driving an increase in units. And we’re investing in that and remain true to that. We expect to continue that by the way throughout the rest of the year. As we think about Q1, it was actually one of our largest overlaps year over year and thus the compare that you’re seeing from the gross margin investment.

That said, as I mentioned before, we’re going to continue to invest in margin, but we also expect our productivity to begin to provide a tailwind as our national buying gradually kicks in as the year progresses. Also keep in mind, our focus is on gross margin dollars, on EBITDA dollars and not on rate. You had a second question about the pricing environment and I might have missed a question in the middle. And what we’re seeing is continued promotional investment from the competitive set, of course in our own operations. We’re also leaning in more heavily on loyalty, on personalized deals.

I would say that the pricing environment is rational, so we’ve not seen any broad swings across the industry at this point in time.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: And I would just add to that that you’re continuing to see pressure from mass club stores and the value players. Thank you, guys. Good luck.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

Leah Jordan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You made an interesting comment that e com profitability is near breakeven and improving. Just seeing if you could provide more detail on the key drivers supporting that improvement. How much is Albertsons Media Collective a factor at this point?

And what’s your line of sight into reaching breakeven in that business?

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: So, Leah, I think it’s really important to recognize that different companies are calling e commerce different things in their P and Ls. When we are talking about e commerce, that is specifically our e commerce business. There is nothing in our e commerce P and L related to the media collective from a financial point of view. Of course, it creates data for the media collective and it is a major provider of information for the media collective, but from a P and L point of view, it’s pure. What is driving that is volume, first and foremost, leveraging the fixed costs of the operations of that business.

Also, efficiency in the business. We’ve invested in tools and systems in order to drive efficiency in labor. And then we are also very much focused on continuing to leverage transportation costs in that process. So it’s across the P and L where we’re seeing improvement, but in that type of a business where you’ve got fixed costs that put the space in the stores, the real estate, because all that’s allocated to that business, we are continuing to lever that. So we are getting very close to breakeven in our ecom business.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Sharon, if I could just add to that as well, and you touched on this, reminder that our fulfillment model is through our stores, and our stores are already in the neighborhoods that are serving our customers, So that creates efficiencies for us perhaps versus some others out there. Think that’s it.

Leah Jordan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then I just had a quick follow-up on the ID sales guidance. I mean, just seeing if you could comment on the cadence of ID sales throughout the quarter. And then with the deceleration that you’re guiding in 2Q, just what are the key drivers of that?

Are you seeing something change with the consumer? Is this related to the pharmacy business? Anything there would be helpful. Thank you.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: Leah, there’s a couple of things. First and foremost, the compares on pharmacy, you have to look at pharmacy growth last quarter, which we disclosed. If you take a look at that, that has a major swing impact on the comp each quarter, so look at that. Secondly, from a cadence point of view, we feel pretty confident that as we progress through the year, we expect to see our on the grocery side of the business, we talked about the fact that we’re expecting to see progressive units as we go through the back half of the year. Thus, the price investment that we have spoken about.

So in Q2, we do need to keep in mind that there will be an impact from the strike that we had during the quarter. So that’ll have an impact, we quantified that for you in order for you to help model. We said in our prepared remarks that we expected in the second quarter to be at the low end of our guidance range. So hopefully that’ll be helpful and we continue to expect to see strong pharmacy in the numbers going into Q2.

Leah Jordan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Very helpful, thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.

Edward Kelly, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Hi, good morning, everyone. I was hoping that you could maybe take a step back and update us on your price investment goals, just kind of given what you have seen so far. Customer response, does that give you any confidence maybe to lean in a little bit more? And then as you think about productivity initiatives rolling in and then you think about returning to your algo next year, is it your expectation that eventually gets to the point where you will continue to invest in price, productivity offsets, gross margin is a bit more stable? Just curious as to how we should be thinking about all that, thank you.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Sure, thanks Ed for the question. So as we think about price, just a reminder, as we went into the year, we have an incredible amount of data and our price investments are very surgical. We know the categories and the markets where we need to make those investments and we’ve begun that process. Also keeping in mind too that as we talk about investing in price, really it’s investing in the total value proposition. So yes, some of it’s based pricing, it’s promotional, it’s investing in our loyalty programs as well.

And of course, focusing on own brands. To date, it’s still early in the investment process. So we’ll be able to understand a little bit more. This is certainly a journey, not something that is a one and done. It will be an iterative process with multiple phases launching throughout the year.

Right now we’ve seen sequential improvements in our unit trajectory, which is what we expected to see. We have been tracking our CPI versus the competitive set and are generally pleased with what we see, but once again it’s quite early in the process. You asked about productivity and what I would say here is, as I mentioned a moment ago, there will be a tailwind from a gross margin perspective as we implement our national buying processes. But keeping in mind too that that is a process, we’re working closely with our vendor partners category by category, vendor by vendor. So we expect to see that start to show through towards the second half of the year, and expect to leave 2025 going into 2026, delivering on the long term algorithm.

Edward Kelly, Analyst, Wells Fargo: And then just maybe a follow-up on the pharmacy and grocery cross shopping momentum. I mean, pharmacy growth has obviously been very impressive, but the grocery business has lagged. And I’m just curious as what’s happening with the momentum of that cross shopping activity, what you’re doing to get those customers to engage more in the store. Over time, I mean, it seems like we should expect the grocery ID to respond to all this. I’m just kind of curious as to how you are thinking about the momentum there and when that really begins to improve.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: So as we’ve shared before, it does take time for the cross shopping to begin between pharmacy and grocery customers. That said, we know what they do, they often visit the store four times more frequently, they drive outsized customer lifetime value, and one of our goals with all of this is of course getting them engaged in both center store and pharmacy, recognizing that as they’re engaging in the pharmacy side of the business, we are working to increase their engagement with higher service offerings, test and treat is one example, immunizations is another. From a grocery perspective, we did see positive growth in grocery in the first quarter, exclusive of our pharmacy business. So we were pleased to see that happening there. As I mentioned before too, we’re focused on creating incredible amounts of productivity in our pharmacy business, including improving our sourcing, buying better, increasing automation, creating solutions for our pharmacy techs and teams to make their jobs more efficient.

We’ve invested in three central fill facilities in our Southwest Division, in Dallas and in Southern Washington State, which are also helping our productivity. So again, we like the total value equation when our customers engage with us in store, in pharmacy, online. That’s a virtuous flywheel for us that drives ongoing growth and productivity, by the way. So we’re very excited about the future and believe in the priorities that we’ve laid forth.

Edward Kelly, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.

Rupesh Parikh, Analyst, Oppenheimer and Company: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just going back to Retail Media, I was just curious how that ramp is going versus expectations so far and just anything surprising at this point?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Hi, Rupesh. We are very pleased with the progress that we’re seeing on the media collective. Our growth is outpacing the industry. Our team has done a phenomenal job of condensing the amount of time that it takes for us to be able to give feedback to our vendor partners on the performance of their investments. They’re enhancing our digital properties so that we have more inventory to be able to sell.

And we are also working on really creating more streamlined personalization opportunities so that our vendor partners can have direct connections with the customers that they are serving. So we feel good about our progress there, but we also see that as some blue sky ahead. We recognize that we’re catching up in some ways and our goal is to leap forward, but there’s great progress there from the team.

Rupesh Parikh, Analyst, Oppenheimer and Company: Great, and then maybe just one follow-up question, just on the consumer, just curious what you guys are seeing right now with the recently passed legislation, just any thoughts on SNAP impact?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: I’ll start with the SNAP impact. So for us, we have a lower penetration of SNAP than the majority of the competitive set that we have. That said, that customer is very important to us. They typically have a larger basket. They’re very loyal and we’ll work hard to make sure that they have the communication and information they need to get access to those resources when available.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: I would also add to that that when you look at the new legislation, there is a very long ramp to implementation of many of the things within that legislation. So in the short term, we don’t anticipate that being a headwind of any material amount in the short term. Thanks, Sharon.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: And on consumer side, we continue to see the customer seeking value. We’re selling more on promotion, that’s been happening for quite some time now. We’re leaning heavily into own brands, understanding that and as we mentioned before, we’re proud of our own brands program that we have, but we’re not satisfied with the penetration that we have. So we’re really leaning in for the Q2 and the rest of the year. That’s upside potential for us moving ahead.

As I think about the customer, we were looking at some category information and it’s been interesting, some of our top performing categories in the first quarter was kind of a tale of two cities. We absolutely saw increases in the shift into pork and ground beef as one example, again indicating that the customer is looking for value. We also saw strong growth in our deli chicken business as an example, knowing that I think customers are always looking for quick and easy meal solutions and with the increase of food away from home, I think inflation was almost 4%. We’re absolutely providing value there.

Rupesh Parikh, Analyst, Oppenheimer and Company: Great, thank you for all the color.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.

John Heinbockel, Analyst, Guggenheim Partners: Hey, guys. I want to start with I think you said, maybe I heard wrong, food volumes were positive in the quarter, grew. Was that right? If so, is that predominantly traffic or items per basket? And then I think your goal, a couple of quarters ago, you talked about 50 basis points.

Is that still a fair goal? You think you can do better than that?

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: Yeah. So, John, traffic in the AIB were positive. On the units, it is a sequential improvement in units from Q4 to Q1. And that is not yet to positive.

John Heinbockel, Analyst, Guggenheim Partners: Okay. And then my follow-up is if you think about you referenced technology, where do you think the most fruitful labor productivity opportunities are? I think about these you guys are are promotional electronic shelf labels, you know, thinking about that, thinking about, you know, automation, back into, the warehouses. Where where are the biggest, opportunities to move the needle on cost per unit?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: John, thanks for the question. So you actually touched on a few that are very important to us today, one of which is DC automation. We’ve had great success with recent launches and look forward to accelerating that agenda for a variety of reasons, efficiency being one of them. With regards to store labor, we have an incredible amount of data and I think about e commerce as one example where we’ve actually been able to enhance productivity because we’re able to get the data that we need to create more predictive scheduling, that’s really helping us create efficiencies there. That’s already underway in the rest of the store and we’re in the process, it’s actually fairly robust in center store, we’re working through the fresh departments, wall to wall forecasting is what we call it and that’s going be a big unlock for us.

We are currently in pilot on ESL in 40 stores at this moment in time, seeing great results there. But to your point, we’re absolutely leaning in heavily on technology and automation of tasks where we can, eliminating pain points across the organization and existing tasks, and looking forward to what we’re going to learn from our experiments on AI across the company, because we see further opportunity there for efficiency.

John Heinbockel, Analyst, Guggenheim Partners: Thank you.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: I would also add that over the last several years, we’ve invested heavily in our stores in several technologies that are used by a very large number of people in our stores. We implemented offresh. We’ve implemented ordering and other types of technologies. And one of the big opportunities that every retailer has is the utilization of that technology. And there is a full court press within the company on execution in the stores and elevating that in our stores.

So, we are expecting to see changes and continued improvement in the stores in the utilization of the tools we currently have. Another area that we continue to invest in, and you have to invest in it from two perspectives. One is the customer experience and one of them is from a shrink perspective, but is in the self checkout and the various things we can do with self checkout from a customer experience point of view. Using Vision AI as part of that process, We saw, as you saw in our prepared remarks, that we did have some favorability in shrink. Part of that, we believe, is coming from the technology that we have invested in self checkout.

So that is another area that it benefits you in labor in many different ways. But the key to self checkout is making sure that that customer experience is as great as it can be, And we’re spending time on that and ensuring that, and I believe that will help us continue to take self checkout to the next level.

Mark Carden, Analyst, UBS: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies0: Hey, Susan. Hey, Sharon. How are you? I wanted to follow-up on pricing. Susan, I’ll ask you about where your head is on pricing.

I think you’ve lived in the high low environment for most of your career. So curious what this iteration looks like. Are you moving to part EDLP with high low? And you mentioned this isn’t is this a one time catch up or this is iterative and, of course, open to changes down the road? And then I don’t know what, in the conversations with vendors, how you’re communicating some of the changes as you try to work with them on the central buying?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Thanks for the question. So first and foremost, I want to highlight the fact that, and I’ve mentioned this a couple of times and we talked about this last time, we have an incredible opportunity with our own brands. Our penetration, while it’s growing at 25.7% for the quarter, we should be at 30% plus. So we are leaning into that from both ends, both from a price perspective but also from a cost of goods perspective so that we can fuel our own growth there. Going back to your price question in general, yes you’re right, we’ve typically been a high low retailer and if I had to describe our go forward approach, I’d say we’re more of a modified high low, that’s where we’re looking to achieve.

And yes, it’s iterative. This is absolutely not a one and done and what the team has created, which is actually pretty fantastic, internally we’ve created a suite of tools that helps us utilize the data that we have to anticipate the changes that we’re making based off of past performance of various price points, understand the customer elasticities and then feed us what those pricing changes should be to optimize unit growth, optimize profitability. Those tools are only becoming more and more robust, we continue to add to the suite, so answer your question shortly, no, this is not a one and done. This is a new go to market strategy. We are deeply engaging our vendor partners, that takes time by the way, so as we talk about our productivity as a tailwind, that will come gradually over time as we’re leaning into partnerships with our vendors to say, hey, how do we do this together?

We want to move more units, we want to move them with you, how can we lean in and create the right opportunity to grow unit sales and share collectively.

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies0: Okay, and then switching topics for a follow-up, SG and A run rate. Can you talk about, I think it was up 3.5% or so. Union contracts,

Paul Lejuez, Analyst, Citi: I’m sure it was part of

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies0: your plan at some point, because you know when they come up and you have some expectation. Can you talk about how the union contract could or couldn’t change that run rate and any investments that come in? And managing it relative to where you think comps can come in, is it in the right range so that you could eventually leverage when you get some of the unit pickup in the back half?

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: Simeon, yes. In our SG and A guidance, in our outlook for this year, we have anticipated what these increases could look like, and that is incorporated in the adjusted EBITDA guidance that we provided for the year. As it relates to other areas in SG and A that you didn’t ask about, keep in mind this quarter we had a year over year benefit of about 63 basis points. Take a look at how much of that is one time cost. You can see the one time cost in our reconciliations in the press release.

So, about half of that comes from the elimination of merger costs, but the rest of that has been driven by productivity. One of the big areas of productivity that we expect to see this year, early in the year particularly, is going to be in SG and A. Remember, we are materially changing our ways of working. We’ve had several announcements on the opening of our new headquarters in India for technology, which we’re very excited about. We are also transitioning many of our back end accounting functions to an existing location that we have in The Philippines, and that transition is also happening.

So, we are making several, we call them internally ways of working moves that are helping to offset some of the pressure that we’re seeing in wages. And wages, don’t want to specifically say union wages, it’s wages in general.

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies0: Thanks. Good luck.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Carden with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Mark Carden, Analyst, UBS: Thanks so much for taking the questions. So on the pharmacy front, how does the contribution shake out from GLP-1s? And then for the growth outside of GLP-1s, is it being more driven by newer customers or more by your engaged existing customers?

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: On the GLP-one question, it’s about half the pharmacy comp. So think about GLP-one as half the comp. However, remember, it comes at an incredibly outsized average unit retail and script growth, actual script growth outside of GLP-one was also very strong. Susan, do you have something you’d like to add to that?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Yeah, so, Sharon touched on it, clearly the profitability is quite different on the GLP-one script itself, but the customer is quite valuable. What we found is there might be an initial dip when they start shopping with us in their grocery basket, but that quickly turns around and actually leans into items like supplements, lean proteins in our meat department, categories that are actually quite profitable for us as a company. Sharon mentioned our core script count ex GLP-one is very strong and that’s again exciting to us as customers continue to engage in our total ecosystem that adds profitability, that adds long term lifetime value, so we feel very good about where we’re at in the pharmacy space. That said, and I mentioned this earlier, we are very focused on productivity there, improving sourcing, increasing automation, and of course, the central field that I spoke of.

Mark Carden, Analyst, UBS: Great, and then on tariffs, I know that indirect impacts were a big unknown from an ingredient and a packaging standpoint in grocery and pharmacy. Now that we’re a few months in, are you expecting this to be any more or less of a contributor to inflation over the course of the next few quarters relative to what you’re expecting last quarter? Thanks.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Thank you. And yes, as we’ve mentioned before, well over 90% of the goods we source are domestically based, but to your point, ingredients are certainly playing a factor in our CPG partners and their cost of goods. We’re starting to see increases in cost of goods moving ahead and we’ve got a very rigorous process of first and foremost, quite frankly just pushing back. We’ve worked hard and it shows in our price position as well that we’ve not passed through all of the inflation that we’re seeing from a cost of goods perspective. Our first line of defense though is to push back with our vendor partners, deconstruct the cost increase and make sure that we’re all in alignment of the rationale behind it, looking for alternate sources of supply or other products that we can push if the tariffs become unwieldy and then finally in certain cases if we have to we’ll pass them on to customers, but we’re going to remain very close to the competitive set, especially on key items when I start to think about commodity items that come through, which is something we do every day right away.

You know, this is part of our DNA. We sell a lot of commodity driven items and we are very agile in the pricing process there.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: And Susan, I would just add to that. It is also having us take a look at what we are offering in OwnBrands. So as we look forward and we look at the tariffs, it may be that there comes a point where we decide that an expansion in our assortment in OwnBrands is a great solution for our customer, and we’re looking at that as well.

Mark Carden, Analyst, UBS: Great. Thanks so much and good luck.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies1: Hi, good morning, Susan and Sharon. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to go back to the sequential improvement in grocery units. It sounds like you were pleased with that. Just want to clarify, would you expect that to continue into Q2, and it’s just a pharmacy dynamic there in Q2?

Just wanted to understand really what underpins that confidence regarding the stronger second half IDs, and what’s the measure of that? Is that more of a grocery unit dynamic?

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: Yeah, Kelly, first and foremost, in Susan’s prepared remarks, her statement about the sequential improvement in units, that is and we were clear it is grocery. So when we are referring to this sequential improvement and what we expect for the balance of the year, what is important and one of our top priorities is growing units in grocery. Now, as we look for the rest of the year, we said last quarter and we continue to believe that each quarter this year, we will continue to sequentially improve grocery units. We’re making the investment in the margin. We are focused on driving those units.

And as we get toward the back half of the year, when you think about the margin, remember what Susan said, the productivity will start to provide a tailwind to the investment in order to drive the units, but we are committed to driving units through the balance of the year. Susan, do you want to add to that?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: No, Sharon, I think you said it well. The primary purpose of the investments that we’re making, yes in price, yes in loyalty, yes in own brands, it’s literally all about driving that unit growth and driving those improvements, so we do expect it to continue. We will be funding it again over time, as we mentioned, investments and the tail list don’t exactly line up, which again, though fits the algorithm that we’ve shared.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: But that’s what gives us the confidence. Your question was what gives us confidence? That is why we are confident.

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies1: That’s helpful. And is there anything that you’ve learned as you’ve had these discussions with vendors in terms of more of a national buying process that makes you think about the opportunity over time and in any different way sizing that up in terms of the impact that could have on productivity?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Yeah, so just what we’re learning as we go through the process is there’s an incredible opportunity for us, right? As you think, we own our own manufacturing plants. So we understand that the more information that we can get and the further out that we’re out on forecasting for our own plants creates incredible efficiencies for production. It’s no different for our vendor partners who shared with us that their ability to forecast demand, which by the way we’re also developing, have developed and then there’s more in development, various AI tools to help us create stronger and further out demand planning signals, but it’s just a complete unlock in terms of efficiencies for everybody. It also enables us to plan further ahead and align our media collective dollars along with our digital dollars and of course the cost of goods reductions that we’ll see so that we can create a comprehensive program in store, online to drive more traffic and drive more units by creating this total package for the customers that we serve.

Our vendors, think we’re a large company and there are times when it’s very efficient and effective for us to act locally and be very agile, but our vendors clearly recognize that there is a significant change in our thought processes that we’re committed to doing this. And I’m excited about what that brings for the future.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: And in the conversations, the goals that we have about driving units are completely aligned with our vendors. So we are aligned, when you’re aligned on the same business objective, it’s very helpful and very constructive in those conversations.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Yes, and to your point, Sherri, we have joint business plan goals that we put in place with most of the major CPGs. So again, we’re aligned on the same targets, we’re leaning in together and I really am excited about what will come in the second half of the year.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.

Paul Lejuez, Analyst, Citi: Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask guidance and then one on the trends for the consumer. So on the guidance front, there was about a 40 or 50 bp increase in ID sales, but then obviously EPS did not change.

So I just wanted to confirm, is that due to the nature of the ID sales being stronger in pharma or was there incremental investments either in price or labor as you do the union contract negotiations that caused that?

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: Yes, so I think it’s

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: a blend of some of the things that you just described. Yes, some of the growth in our pharmacy growth continues to be outsized, right? And that’s great because we love that customer, we love that relationship, but there is an impact on profitability there. Sharon, is there anything that you would add from?

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: I think that throughout the year, we expect this in the total comp guidance for 2025, pharmacy is going to be the biggest driver of comp for sales growth for the year. We are continuing, you know what that business is doing, Mike, and we continue to believe that we are going to continue to take share from pharmacy. On the grocery side, you will see that each quarter we expect to see gradual and incremental improvement in units. And that will, through the year, bring the grocery comp as a slightly bigger percentage of the total. But on the top line, you’re going to see the increase that we put in the guidance for 2025, that is pharmacy grade.

Paul Lejuez, Analyst, Citi: Got it. Okay, thanks for clarifying that. And then just in terms of the consumer trends, as it relates to kind of better for you product, natural, organic and otherwise, what percent of the mix is that for you today? How is that trending? And I guess is there any surprises that you’re seeing with respect to GLP-one absorption and then how that’s impacting consumer buying behavior?

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Sure, so Mike what we’re seeing, we call it NOSHI, natural organic specialty health and ethnic products, and those categories are growing for us. It’s interesting as you start to break it down, I think there’s a few things in play. Certainly trends you, sorry, certainly trends in better for you products are strong. Also interesting though, the influence that we see from specialty items like premium sparkling water is one of our top growth categories, it’s fascinating to watch. This one, oh I had to double check the numbers, but cottage cheese is actually a strong growth category, yes some of that is from the focus on protein, lower carbs, perhaps GLP-one users, then, just being totally frank, Tick Tock is driving some of that.

So we’re leaning into those categories, they do lend themselves, those categories pair well with some of what we see for GLP-one customers, but it goes well beyond just the GLP user. We’re definitely seeing overall trends focusing on health and well-being, and that works perfectly for us as one of our five priorities is driving the customer value proposition and creating an environment, an ecosystem that brings customers into brick and mortar, into digital, into pharmacy and health.

Paul Lejuez, Analyst, Citi: Got it, thank you.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.

Cody Purdue, Senior Vice President, Treasury, Investor Relations and Risk Management, Albertsons Companies2: Hi. This is Kendall Toscano on for Robbie. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a follow-up in terms of the percent of your customers that are cross shopping grocery and pharmacy today versus how much higher you think that number could go over time. And basically just trying to get a sense of after four years of pharmacy growth in the double digit range, which has obviously been a huge sales driver but a headwind to profitability, are we nearing a point where pharmacy could eventually start to normalize or the growth rate could start to

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: normalize? Thanks. Hi, Kendall. So what we’re seeing is, yes, of course the cross shopping between pharmacy and grocery is pivotal for us. We do have very strong pharmacy growth and I mentioned a lot of that is core pharmacy business.

Just a side note there as well, in that core pharmacy business we continue to strive for profitability, stronger profitability, increasing our generics mix, improving offerings such as test and treat, immunizations, those kinds of things. And again, creating that linkage between store and pharmacy is critical. From the pharmacy business, here’s what I see. There’s been a serious, I mean you guys see the information out there, there’s been a serious decline in the availability of doors for customers to go to take care of their pharmacy needs. We think that’s critical.

And I believe that we’re well positioned with the steps that we’ve made both from an acquisition perspective, meaning acquiring scripts from outside, hiring the amazing pharmacists and techs that are out there looking for work. We need more and more of that support. So we’re leveraging that and becoming, think we’re becoming, that helps become an essential choice for customers. I can get my groceries there, I can meet my pharmacy needs in an environment where the doors are shrinking, right? We have less and less opportunity in certain markets, less choices for customers and we’re happy to be there for them.

So I actually see it as a moat and a competitive advantage for us moving ahead with the investments that we’ve made in pharmacy. And so that again, can’t repeat also the fact that we are striving to improve the profitability there. Again, recognizing that that customer’s total value when we engage them in both center store as well as pharmacy is tremendous for us. We love those customers. We want to serve them.

Sharon McCollum, President and CFO, Albertsons Companies: And Susan, would only add also, we have invested significantly in the customer experience in pharmacy, integrating it into the total company app, and being able to serve that customer, including, we talked last quarter, now being able to pick up your prescription at the same time that you’re picking up your Drive Up and Go order. And as we continue to create the linkage and the ease of shopping between the pharmacy customer and the grocery customer, we believe that that does provide incremental opportunity for us as we move forward, through the year and into next year. So these investments we’re making on the digital side and linking them together with everything we’re doing in pharmacy and health and then the mobile app for use in the stores, we think that that is also going to make a significant difference with these cross shopping customers. Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I’ll turn the floor back to Ms. Morris for any final comments.

Susan Morris, CEO, Albertsons Companies: Just thank you everybody for the time today. We’re excited about the year to come, and, thank you to our associates that make all of this happen.

ID20,HP Inc,2025-07-15 13:41:08+00:00,Trellis,Why HP Inc. now lets its sales partners offer refurbished equipment - Trellis Group,"Heather Clancy, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://trellis.net/article/why-hp-inc-now-lets-its-sales-partners-sell-refurbished-pcs-printers/,"The initiative was created to support HP Renew Solutions, a business unit formed in November 2023 to expand sales of HP Certified Refurbished technology.
Effective immediately, any HP sales partner authorized to sell HP products can also represent the secondhand editions.
“Leaving the channel out of this would have been myopic,” said Claudia Contreras, vice president of HP Renew Solutions.
More buyers want secondhand products HP’s program is similar to one offered by networking gear manufacturer Cisco for its remanufactured equipment.
HP created the Amplify Impact certification in 2021 for sales partners that use sustainability metrics to close deals.","HP Inc. is encouraging its third-party sales partners to sell refurbished versions of its personal computers and printers by compensating them at the same rate they would receive for new products.

The initiative was created to support HP Renew Solutions, a business unit formed in November 2023 to expand sales of HP Certified Refurbished technology. These are products returned to HP by commercial customers when leases expire or during technology upgrade cycles, reconditioned with fresh components and offered for resale.

Effective immediately, any HP sales partner authorized to sell HP products can also represent the secondhand editions. They were previously only sold through HP’s direct sales representatives.

HP’s third-party sales channel drives approximately 85 percent of the company’s annual revenue, according to past company statements. The company reported $54 billion in sales for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, 2024.

“Leaving the channel out of this would have been myopic,” said Claudia Contreras, vice president of HP Renew Solutions.

More buyers want secondhand products

HP’s program is similar to one offered by networking gear manufacturer Cisco for its remanufactured equipment. Cisco’s original program has been available for nearly three decades, but Cisco introduced a circularity promotion in January 2024 to make it more lucrative for partners to sell remanufactured gear. Cisco’s indirect sales channel accounts for close to 90 percent of its revenue.

Customer interest in refurbished options covered by HP guarantees about quality — important for erasing a potential stigma against reused computers and information technology — convinced the company to turn HP Renew Solutions into a standalone business initiative with undisclosed revenue goals.

HP’s pledge is for 75 percent of its product and packaging content, by weight, to come from recycled, renewable or reused materials or components by 2030.

“We want to make sure that we are participating not just in the first life of these products but also in the second life,” Contreras said.

The portfolio of refurbished products available for resale to commercial customers varies depending on the region, she said.

Certain personal computers are available in France, Spain, U.K. and U.S. One example is a refurbished version of HP’s EliteBook laptop computer that has a carbon footprint that is 60 percent lower than the original edition, she estimated. (The percentage varies depending on the product.) More recently, refurbished printers can be included as part of managed services contracts in the U.S. and European Union.

“If you are a company that is making bold and public claims about reducing emissions, this offers a very measurable way to lower the impact of your IT assets,” Contreras said.

Sustainability metrics as deal closers

The new program supporting refurbished products is an extension of initiatives HP started offering in 2020 in response to commercial customer requests for more information about the energy consumption and carbon footprint metrics associated with HP’s products.

HP’s ability to offer information about sustainability as part of sales discussions translated into more than $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2020 and 2021. The company didn’t disclose data for 2023, the latest year for which an HP environmental information is available. Its next report is due in several weeks.

HP created the Amplify Impact certification in 2021 for sales partners that use sustainability metrics to close deals. More than half of HP certified partners have completed that training. HP declined to disclose how many partners are part of the overall Amplify program, citing competitive reasons, but past reports put the number around 10,000.

Compensating HP partners equally for new and certified refurbished products allows salespeople to focus on customer needs, said Mary Beth Walker, vice president and head of global partner experience and engagement at HP.

“We made a collective decision that in markets where HP Renew Solutions are available, we would equally incentivize all partners to equip customers working to adopt greater circularity,” she said.

Creating a level playing field was helpful, said Prashant Singh, vice president at HP partner End Point Solutions. “As a solutions integrator, we focus on helping clients get more from their device investments — not just at the point of purchase but throughout the entire lifecycle,” Singh said. “The flexibility and support to sell HP Certified Refurbished devices has been essential for keeping our clients productive even when budgets are tight.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HP-Renew-Solutions-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 12:34:48.295134

“As a robotic surgeon, we want LigaSure technology because it gives us confidence in the security of the seal.
The Medtronic Hugo RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies.
In the EU, the Hugo RAS system is CE marked.
In the U.S., the Hugo RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.","The company also announces plans to share new gynaecologic data for the Hugo RAS system and conduct a telesurgery demo at the Society of Robotic Surgery 2025 Annual Meeting in Strasbourg, France Surgical.

Medtronic has announced it has received CE Mark for the LigaSure RAS vessel-sealing technology, expanding Hugo robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system capabilities for gynaecologic, general, and urologic procedures in Europe.

As the first-ever robotic-driven LigaSure instrument, this milestone represents the beginning of a new era for the vessel-sealing technology that has been used in more than 35 million procedures across 65+ countries over the last two decades.

“Today, with CE Mark for LigaSure RAS, Medtronic is fulfilling a promise to customers to integrate our trusted vessel-sealing technology onto the Hugo RAS system,” said Matt Anderson, senior vice president and president of the Surgical business, which is part of the Medical Surgical Portfolio at Medtronic. “More than fulfilling a commitment, this regulatory approval is a big step forward as we continue to shape the future of surgery with surgical teams who share our passion and commitment to deliver the best possible care to every patient.”

Dr. Miguel Caceres of Pacifica Salud Hospital in Panama was one of the first surgeons in the world to use LigaSure RAS with the Hugo RAS system: “LigaSure technology is one of the most important advances for minimally invasive surgery because it provides sealing and cutting in a way that is very, very secure for the performance of the surgeon and the security of the patient,” said Dr. Caceres. “As a robotic surgeon, we want LigaSure technology because it gives us confidence in the security of the seal. We are already seeing the benefits in our cases with the Hugo RAS system.”

Powered by the Valleylab FT10 energy platform and for use exclusively with the Hugo RAS system, the LigaSure RAS Maryland instrument is indicated for sealing and cutting vessels, thick tissue, and lymphatics up to and including 7 mm in diameter. The device reliably seals vessels in approximately 2 seconds while minimising thermal spread to surrounding tissue.

Dr. Caceres, who has been using the Hugo RAS system four years, will discuss his initial experience with LigaSure RAS during a Medtronic-sponsored symposium at the Society of Robotic Surgery (SRS) 2025 Annual Meeting, July 16-20 in Strasbourg, France.

SRS also includes a presentation on preliminary outcomes of hysterectomy for benign gynecologic conditions — a Medtronic-sponsored study of 112 Hugo RAS procedures across eight sites in Europe and Asia. Dr. Francesco Fanfani, associate professor at Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic, will present the data.

Looking ahead to the next frontier of surgery, Medtronic will demo telesurgery capabilities on the Hugo RAS system from the nearby IRCAD facility — one of its strategic training partners. The demo will be followed by a panel discussion, including authors of Technical Guidelines for Remote Robotic-Assisted Surgery, which was recently published in the Journal of World Surgery.

The paper is a foundational piece to support safe and scalable telesurgery, reinforcing Medtronic’s commitment to innovation powered by human connection.

These announcements come amid growing momentum for the Hugo RAS system, which is now in use across 30+ countries on five continents, with over 270 independent publications supporting its clinical use across urology, gynaecology, and general surgery procedures.

In the U.S., the company’s submission for a urology indication is under review by the Food and Drug Administration, with an expected U.S. entrance later in the company’s current fiscal year, followed by planned indication expansions into hernia and gynaecology.

The Medtronic Hugo RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies. Regulatory requirements of individual countries and regions will determine approval, clearance, or market availability. In the EU, the Hugo RAS system is CE marked. In the U.S., the Hugo RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.",https://med-techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ligausre-rs-2.png,N,,2025-07-15 11:09:11.011289

From Q2 there has been an “uncertainty pause” the firm noted, saying it is seeing “strategic decision to delay new expenditures. The IT hardware and infrastructure sectors are particularly affected due to price increases and supply chain disruptions. In contrast, ongoing or recurring spending, such as cloud and managed services, is maintaining greater stability.”

Its researchers cautioned, however, that ""while these figures are encouraging, they must be contextualized within the current scope and maturity of implementation. A significant portion of the observed gains can be attributed to the automation of straightforward, repetitive tasks—representing early-stage efficiencies rather than long-term transformational impact.

""Furthermore, the underlying data may be subject to bias, as it is derived from a limited number of early adopters, many of whom operate in environments that are already conducive to AI integration. The ample size remains small, and large-scale deployments are still relatively rare.""

In the first half of 2025, Nikon Advanced Manufacturing has already made a series of key strides towards accomplishing that objective.
I don’t necessarily want to say we need to revitalize the DIB, because I think defense manufacturing in the U.S. is still quite robust.","There are countless metrics you can use, whether quantitative or qualitative, to judge the success of an organization. One of the most important may simply be the organization’s ability to set a clear agenda for itself and effectively demonstrate that it can follow through.

According to those parameters, Nikon Advanced Manufacturing has been having quite a successful year. Moreover, the success the company has achieved thus far in 2025 is the kind that looks to be setting up Nikon Advanced Manufacturing for even bigger things in the not-too-distant future.

I think Nikon is the sort of enterprise that everyone in the additive manufacturing (AM) industry should keep an eye on, given the legacy of the parent corporation, the AM business unit’s series of key acquisitions over the last few years, and its ties to some of the world’s most significant adopters of metal AM. From a personal standpoint, I’m especially interested in watching the story of Nikon Advanced Manufacturing unfold because the interview I did last fall with the company’s CEO, Hamid Zarringhalam, was one of the most instructive conversations I’ve had about the AM industry.

In that interview, Zarringhalam laid out the company’s multi-year roadmap for building connections to the most strategically critical sectors, primarily centered on targeting the U.S. defense market. In the first half of 2025, Nikon Advanced Manufacturing has already made a series of key strides towards accomplishing that objective. The company’s progress on that front includes a deal between Nikon SLM Solutions, ATI, and Bechtel Plant Machinery Inc., to print hypersonic parts for the U.S. Navy; a contract from America Makes to develop an aluminum alloy dataset for aerospace and defense applications; and a strategic partnership with ASTM International to develop applications and engage in workforce development in support of the U.S. defense industrial base (DIB).

At the end of June, less than a year after our last conversation, I spoke with Zarringhalam again to determine how the CEO is feeling amid what appears to be extremely positive momentum for Nikon Advanced Manufacturing’s long-term implementation of its metal AM-centric business plan. Zarringhalam clearly knows that the company is moving in the right direction, while also emphasizing that it’s just started to lay the groundwork for what it’s ultimately capable of:

“I’m really pleased about the progress we’ve made,” Zarringhalam affirmed, “and it hasn’t been easy. Coming from the semiconductor space, that’s the speed and wavelength I operate on, so at times, metal AM has felt slow to me. There’s much more to come — and there are also other things that we’ve done for the defense market that we haven’t announced yet.

“In terms of what we’ve already achieved, I’m very excited about this America Makes proposal. When you take our equipment capability with Nikon SLM Solutions, which enables high-productivity output on large-format machines, and combine that with our manufacturing and engineering services arm at our facility in Long Beach, I think we’ve created a compelling blueprint for scaling the U.S. DIB’s necessary future capabilities on domestic shores.”

By partnering with powder supplier Constellium and a handful of other collaborators to qualify Constellium’s CP1 aluminum alloy powder for defense applications, Nikon Advanced Manufacturing has embarked on a project that can prove the company’s ability to maximize harmony between all of its various elements:

“There’s a lot of interest in CP1, a high-strength aluminum alloy, from defense and aerospace manufacturers, as well as manufacturers for the space industry. In order to meet that demand, the alloy needs to be qualified on large-format, high-productivity machines,” Zarringhalam explained. “The NXG XII 600 Series aren’t just R&D machines: there are around 50 of them in the field already, producing end-use parts. 80 percent of those systems are operating as a fleet together, so there are many repeat buys.

“Getting CP1 qualified on the NXG XII 600 gives the powder an ideal opportunity to be utilized at scale by experienced end-users. It wasn’t a small investment for us, to put ourselves in the position to be able to secure the contract. In addition to dedicating a machine solely to this one alloy, and the manpower required to operate the system at our facility, we also needed support letters from all of our partners on the contract.

“That illustrates how committed we are to helping the DIB to scale emerging capabilities in the U.S., and I think it’s a classic example of successful industrial policy in action, working to create a common manufacturing ecosystem.”

One of Nikon’s partners on the America Makes contract is ASTM International, bringing together two enterprises with more than two centuries of combined experience in standardizing the most advanced manufacturing processes during any given era of their respective existences. The strategic partnership established by Nikon and ASTM, separate from the America Makes contract, will benefit from access to the resources, infrastructure, and personnel at the Nikon AM Technology Center in Long Beach.

Nikon, in turn, will benefit from ASTM’s ability to certify new workers in powder bed fusion (PBF) processes, particularly when it comes to ASTM’s know-how in leveraging metal AM for maritime applications:

“ASTM obviously brings value in terms of their expertise at standardization, which is a prerequisite to be able to scale effectively. You also need to be able to develop the workforce in order to standardize and scale, and that’s another thing that ASTM does well,” Zarringhalam said. “Now, we have this facility in Long Beach that will not only qualify materials, and offer engineering services, but also train the machine operators needed in order to produce the parts needed by the defense sector. The facility is becoming more than just a single production site, it’s growing into a fully integrated hub that can develop and execute industrial strategy.

“On the defense as well as the commercial side, the maritime sector right now — for both the U.S. and its allies — needs to drastically accelerate manufacturing capacity in order for all the relevant nations to meet their production goals. Recently, the U.K. announced a major defense spending increase, and a major aspect of that increase involved shipbuilding. Australia is in the process of preparing to build the first AUKUS-class submarines.

“The work that goes into fulfilling all of these objectives will be pulling from the same supply chain. If we come up with a solution in the U.S. that serves the maritime sector in general, and the submarine industrial base, in particular, I think the best outcome for everyone would be to devise solutions that can be replicated as easily as possible, in any allied locality where the manufacturing ultimately takes place.”

That is precisely why the maritime industrial base in the U.S. and its allied and partner nations needs — broadly — more advanced manufacturing capacity, more metal AM capacity, specifically, and, above all, why the West’s maritime industrial base needs to accelerate the involvement of companies like Nikon Advanced Manufacturing, which occupy the ideal ground for unlocking the potential of collaborations between the oldest primes and the newest startups.

Along those lines, Zarringhalam’s decades of experience in the semiconductor capital equipment business give the CEO a perfect vantage point for approaching the sorts of changes that the metal AM market can help the U.S. DIB implement. Distributed manufacturing enabled by AM presents a new perspective on the concept, but Zarringhalam’s vision for what Nikon Advanced Manufacturing can bring to the maritime sector and the defense sector at large is in the mold of fabless manufacturing. This is the business model in the semiconductor industry whereby a small number of companies design and market chips that are produced by third-party foundries.

While this is the norm today, it was unheard of until the late 1980s, a shift that displays how quickly the semiconductor industry can reorganize itself. There’s nothing that says the underlying philosophy can’t be applied to other verticals:

“We’re advocating for an industrial strategy that can lead to high-scale, high-volume output with metal AM,” asserted Zarringhalam. “One way to do that, potentially, would be to design the product in one location, maybe even do low-volume initial production, and then basically transfer that process over to an AM farm elsewhere.

“This would require a joint strategy between the government and private industry, and the investments would need to be made by and between resilient companies. Spreading the work to companies whose survival isn’t guaranteed isn’t a feasible option, in this context.

“That’s another lesson from semiconductor manufacturing. I remember sitting in customer meetings, discussing technology roadmaps on a ten-year forward-facing timeline, and the process is always to some extent a bet on emergent technologies. That process doesn’t work unless both the manufacturers and the suppliers have a proven track record of resilience over the long haul.”

Echoing our last conversation, Zarringhalam concluded by making an apt comparison between the current global industrial context and that of the Cold War:

“I’ll be satisfied when I see advanced manufacturing integrated in a way that sets up the future of U.S. industry to succeed, especially when it comes to the DIB. I don’t necessarily want to say we need to revitalize the DIB, because I think defense manufacturing in the U.S. is still quite robust.

“But the gaps that are there are the sorts of problems that need to be solved by advanced manufacturing processes and advanced technologies like metal AM, and something we can be optimistic about, here, is that we’ve done this before. 50 or 60 years ago, we started down a similar path, and that effort won the Cold War. People in the positions to make a difference realized what needed to be done, they overcame existing deficiencies and limitations, and they did it by implementing and bringing to scale the most advanced manufacturing technologies available at the time.

“If we can play any small part in accomplishing that same sort of mission in the 21st century, I’ll be very proud of what we’ve done.”

Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future

Philip Morris International is a leading international consumer goods company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, nicotine pouch and e-vapor products. As of December 31, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets, and PMI estimates they were used by 38.6 million adults around the world. The smoke-free business accounted for 42% of PMI’s first-quarter 2025 total net revenues. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match’s General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI’s IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product authorizations from the FDA.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another naturally derived food dye on Monday, making good on one of its key promises in the effort to rid the US food system of petroleum-based synthetic dyes.

The FDA approved the natural food color gardenia blue — made from the gardenia plant — for use in sports and fruit drinks, flavored waters, teas and candy. This follows the May approval of three other natural colors , and fulfills an April promise from the agency and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fast-track authorization of four new natural color additive

In April the FDA announced they would revoke authorization for two food dyes (Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B), and work with industry to eliminate six other synthetic dyes by the end of next year.

“This expedited timeline underscores our serious intent to transition away from petroleum-based synthetic dyes in the food supply,” FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a statement. “By expanding the palette of available colors derived from natural sources, food manufacturers have a variety of options available that will make it easier to end their use of petroleum-based dyes.”

The FDA also sent a letter Monday to food makers encouraging them to phase-out the synthetic Red Dye No. 3, which is linked to cancer and used in over 2,800 food products, sooner than the current January 15, 2027 required deadline.

“The FDA believes that accelerating the phase out of the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in foods will help further the goal of Making America Healthy Again,” the FDA said in the letter. The popularity of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement associated with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fueled the recent agency actions.

Public health advocates have called for the elimination of certain synthetic dyes in foods for years, citing scientific research linking consumption of the dyes to disease and to health problems including hyperactivity and behavioral problems in children. The dyes are commonly found in candy, sodas, cereals, sports drinks and other highly processed foods, but also show up in unexpected items like casserole mixes, yogurts and salad dressings.

“This expedited timeline underscores our serious intent to transition away from petroleum-based synthetic dyes in the food supply.” – Dr. Marty Makary, FDA

While the synthetic dye phase out is voluntary, food makers have responded: food giants Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo and General Mills have all committed to phasing out the chemicals. The Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that represents a variety of manufacturers including food and drink makers, announced last week that it would encourage its food and beverage manufacturers to remove synthetic dyes from products served in US schools by the start of the 2026-2027 school year.

“While these safe ingredients are supported by scientific evidence and a longstanding history of approval by the FDA, the industry recognizes preferences are evolving and is innovating to meet families where they are,” Melissa Hockstad, president & CEO of Consumer Brands, said in a statement.

Recent research suggests the changes could have a massive impact: nearly 20% of packaged foods and drinks in the US have synthetic dyes, with most marketed to children and loaded with sugar, according to a June study that examined nearly 40,000 items from popular food brands.

While revenue growth and cross-selling initiatives highlight strengths, rising interest expenses and credit risks underscore vulnerabilities. For long-term investors, the question is whether BNY Mellon's strategic bets on digitization and client diversification can sustain momentum in a volatile environment.

Revenue Growth: A Balancing Act

The bank's 5.6% year-over-year revenue increase to $4.85 billion was driven by its Securities Services segment, where fee income rose 3% and net interest income (NII) surged 8.7%. This NII boost aligns with higher interest rates, a tailwind that could reverse if the Federal Reserve pivots to rate cuts. Meanwhile, asset management fees remain tepid, with AUM growing just 2% to $2.088 trillion. This sluggishness suggests BNY Mellon is grappling with broader industry challenges, including outflows from traditional wealth management and rising competition from digital platforms.

Operational Momentum: AI and Cross-Selling

BNY Mellon's “Eliza” AI platform, now used by 8,000+ employees and delivering 40+ solutions, represents a critical lever for efficiency. The company's push to cross-sell services—40% more clients now use three or more BNY products—is also promising. This diversification reduces reliance on any single revenue stream and creates recurring revenue, a key advantage in an uncertain economy. CEO Robin Vince's emphasis on this as the firm's “most compelling growth opportunity” signals strategic focus.

Risks on the Horizon

Despite these positives, risks loom large. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) rose 11% year-over-year to $251 million, a red flag as credit quality could deteriorate further if recession fears materialize. Meanwhile, non-interest expenses jumped 5.3%, squeezing margins—a trend investors should monitor closely. BNY Mellon's robust capital ratios (Tier 1 leverage at 6.1%, total capital at 15.3%) provide a buffer, but sustained cost inflation could test its ability to maintain dividend payouts (currently yielding 2.8%).

Valuation and Market Sentiment

The stock trades at $89.75—a 4.3% discount to its $94 consensus price target—and has underperformed the S&P 500 by 0.5% over the past month. Analysts are cautiously optimistic, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) but a Zacks ESP model warning of a -0.14% likelihood of beating estimates in the near term. This reflects skepticism about whether BNY can offset macro challenges with its operational upgrades.

Investment Takeaway

BNY Mellon remains a fortress balance sheet with enduring scale in global custody and institutional services. Its AI and cross-selling strategies position it to capitalize on digitization trends, while its dividend provides steady income. However, investors must weigh these positives against rising expenses, NPL risks, and reliance on interest-sensitive revenue.

Recommendation: Hold for income-oriented investors, but prioritize caution on growth expectations. Monitor Q3 updates on NII trends and AI deployment effectiveness. If expenses stabilize and cross-selling gains momentum, BNY Mellon could justify its valuation—and even outperform peers. Conversely, any further NPL spikes or margin pressure would warrant a rethink.

Historically, earnings releases for BNY Mellon have been positive catalysts. Over the past four years, the stock saw a maximum 1.16% return on day 16 following earnings announcements, with a 57% win rate over 3 and 10 days, rising to 71% over 30 days. This consistency suggests that earnings events have amplified investor confidence over time.

The systems designed for one reality were instantly fractured by the demands of another, exposing a critical gap in the nation’s food access infrastructure.

The scale of this gap quickly became terrifyingly clear. What few outside the sphere of government benefits and payment processing realized was the extremely limited scope of online EBT acceptance pre-pandemic. It wasn’t merely uncommon; it was practically non-existent, confined to a small, obscure USDA pilot program operating in just a handful of zip codes. The digital rails needed to carry these essential benefits into the online grocery ecosystem simply had not been laid on any meaningful scale.

Against this backdrop, my team and I received a mandate that felt staggering in its ambition and urgency: build a nationwide EBT acceptance system for Instacart, and do it in four months. A project that, under normal circumstances, would represent a multi-year undertaking involving intricate technical development, complex regulatory navigation and extensive partner integration was now an emergency response measure. The timeline wasn’t just accelerated; it was compressed almost beyond recognition.

This wasn’t merely a technical challenge; it was a race against a rapidly escalating human crisis. As lockdowns continued and economic disruption spread, food insecurity surged across America. The code we were tasked with writing, the systems we needed to architect, represented more than just a new feature; it was a potential lifeline for millions struggling to feed their families safely.

The months that followed were a crucible. Our team worked relentlessly, often around the clock, navigating the added complexities of remote collaboration during a global health crisis. The task demanded intense coordination not only internally but with a vast network of external partners: government agencies at both federal and state levels, payment processors grappling with new requirements and grocery retailers, many of which had never seriously considered integrating EBT payments into their digital operations.

The regulatory landscape alone was a formidable obstacle. SNAP/EBT systems were fundamentally designed for the physical world of swipe cards and PIN pads, not the fluid environment of ecommerce. Each state had its own distinct implementation requirements and approval processes, creating a complex patchwork of rules that had to be meticulously understood and integrated. Navigating this labyrinthine world of government benefit regulations while simultaneously building a secure and user-friendly online system became my all-consuming focus.

Amidst the blur of development sprints and regulatory meetings, one moment stands out: the night we pushed our very first EBT transaction to production. I vividly recall the anticipation and pressure culminating in that single order, placed by a family in South Carolina. It represented far more than a successful deployment; it symbolized months of frantic effort, countless hurdles overcome and technical innovation born from sheer necessity. It was a beacon of hope, proof that the impossible might just be achievable.

Following that initial breakthrough, the pace did not slacken. As the pandemic continued its relentless march through 2020 and 2021, we rapidly scaled the system. What began as a pilot expanded to hundreds of retailers across dozens of states by early 2022. Systems that typically required years of careful planning, development, testing and deployment were being built and rolled out in a matter of weeks, driven by the persistent, urgent need.

Amidst the whirlwind of building and scaling, a routine analysis of user data delivered a jolt. Late one night, while examining checkout flows, I noticed a troubling pattern: a significant number of visitors originating from lower-income zip codes were adding groceries to their carts, proceeding to checkout, and then abruptly abandoning the process. It wasn’t just random attrition; it was a distinct signal concentrated in areas where EBT usage was likely higher.

This data point sparked a critical hypothesis in my mind: these weren’t users simply changing their minds. They were likely EBT recipients, navigating the online store, selecting their needed groceries, only to discover at the final, crucial step that their primary means of payment wasn’t accepted online. The data wasn’t just indicating friction; it was revealing a moment of profound disappointment and likely frustration for users who had invested time and hope in the process.

This realization served as a powerful wake-up call for me and the team. It underscored that simply enabling EBT transactions wasn’t sufficient. The system needed to be designed with a deeper understanding of the EBT user’s journey, anticipating their needs and potential pain points before they hit a dead end.

Code as Compassion: Engineering the Foundation

The insight gleaned from the cart abandonment data became a driving force behind the next phase of development. It wasn’t enough to simply process EBT; the system needed to guide and support users from the moment they arrived. This led me back into the complexities of benefit regulations and spurred the development of foundational features designed explicitly to pre-empt the frustration revealed by the data.

First came an address-based detection system I built. By leveraging geographic data, the platform could intelligently suggest EBT payment options upfront to users in areas with high benefit usage. This simple, proactive step aimed to prevent the late-stage disappointment, informing users early in their shopping journey that their benefits could potentially be used. Crucially, this feature included user controls, allowing individuals to manage this suggestion based on their preference.

Next, our team tackled the enormous complexity of SNAP eligibility rules. We engineered an eligibility engine capable of evaluating Instacart’s entire, vast catalog of items in real time. This system determined precisely which products qualified for purchase with EBT funds, providing clarity to users as they shopped and preventing confusion at checkout.

The payment flow itself presented the most significant technical hurdle. EBT users often need to pay for groceries (EBT-eligible) and other items (like fees or non-food essentials) in a single order. I architected a sophisticated split-tender functionality. This system could seamlessly process multiple payment methods within one transaction, automatically applying EBT funds to eligible items first and smoothly transitioning any remaining balance to a secondary payment method like a credit or debit card, all without causing user confusion. These technical solutions, born from that “wake-up call” data, were fundamentally about removing barriers and creating a more intuitive, supportive path for EBT users.

Beyond Transactions: Engineering for Dignity

As the system evolved, testing with actual EBT recipients provided another layer of crucial understanding. Functionality was vital, but the experience of using the system carried its own weight. Feedback revealed that some users felt a sense of stigma or discomfort when using their benefits, even online. This feedback sparked a conscious effort within our team to embed privacy and dignity directly into the platform’s design.

Recognizing the potential for unconscious bias, we built privacy protections into the shopper application used by fulfillment staff. The system was designed to conceal the customer’s specific payment method details from the Instacart shopper picking and packing the order. This measure aimed to ensure that interactions, especially around item replacements or service issues, were handled without prejudice based on payment type.

For customers choosing grocery pickup, another subtle but significant feature was implemented. I modified label-generation algorithms to omit any identifiers that might indicate EBT payment on the order labels. This allowed customers to collect their groceries discreetly, preserving their privacy and dignity during the handover process.

Our commitment to user well-being extended to more proactive, data-driven features. Analyzing millions of transactions revealed distinct, state-specific patterns of when EBT benefits were disbursed. This led to the development of what I considered a landmark achievement: a benefits cycle optimization engine. This system allowed us to intelligently time promotions and adjust inventory predictions, ensuring greater product availability and potentially more impactful savings for customers precisely when they received their monthly benefits.

Furthermore, we built custom recommendation engines. These suggested affordable, nutritious alternatives if a user’s chosen item was out of stock, prioritizing EBT-eligible options when appropriate. Building on this, intelligent bundling logic suggested complementary non-food essentials (like cleaning supplies or personal care items) alongside EBT-eligible groceries, sometimes paired with strategic discounts to help customers maximize their overall budget.

These features represented a shift beyond merely facilitating transactions to actively supporting the user’s needs, grounded in the principle that technology should not only function efficiently but also operate with respect and consideration for the user’s circumstances.

The Ripple Effect: Measuring What Matters

The impact of this concerted effort, born in crisis and refined through empathy, was profound. Within 18 months of our first transaction, Instacart’s EBT systems were processing orders across more than 44 states and integrated with hundreds of retailers. The business metrics validated our approach: EBT customers demonstrated higher retention rates than traditional customers, indicating the service was meeting a critical, ongoing need and fostering loyalty. Furthermore, this customer segment contributed significantly to the business, accounting for approximately 10% of company revenue.

This data powerfully illustrated that designing for inclusion and serving vulnerable populations was not merely an act of corporate social responsibility, but a strategically sound decision yielding tangible business value. The high retention rates suggested that by meeting a fundamental need previously unaddressed in the digital space, we had cultivated a loyal and appreciative customer base. The perceived dichotomy between “doing good” and “doing well” dissolved; the social impact and business success were demonstrably intertwined.

Yet the numbers told only part of the story. The true measure of success, for me and the team, often arrived not in spreadsheets, but in emails. Messages from customers – a grandmother in rural Wyoming expressing gratitude for groceries delivered during a blizzard, a disabled veteran appreciating the ability to shop with dignity without facing physical store limitations – these were the testaments that resonated most deeply. They painted a vivid picture of the real-world difference our system was making in people’s lives.

The intense journey of building Instacart’s EBT system under extreme pressure yielded invaluable lessons, extending far beyond the specific context of online grocery or benefit payments.

Practical Tips

See the need before it hits a wall: Use geographic and user data proactively to anticipate needs and suggest relevant options early in the user journey.

Align with users’ realities: Understand external rhythms (like benefit disbursement) that shape user behavior and design systems that actively support them.

Curate for accessibility: Leverage digital flexibility to create tailored experiences (like EBT-focused aisles) addressing specific user needs.

Design for dignity, not just function: Recognize and actively mitigate potential social stigma through thoughtful design, ensuring a respectful and safe experience.

Make complexity invisible: Engineer seamless solutions for complex requirements (like multi-tender payments) to minimize user burden and confusion.

Amplify impact holistically: Think beyond the core transaction; use recommendations and strategic offers to help users maximize resources.

Ensure equitable access: Prioritize performance on diverse devices and network conditions, recognizing reliance on older/less powerful tech.

Protect the vulnerable: Implement specialized, compliant security and fraud prevention tailored to unique risks, balancing protection with usability, like building timed sessions that automatically log out on public computers.",https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VP_X-Instacart.png,N,,2025-07-15 12:35:02.388240

And he’s betting that better data and smarter supply chains are what will keep healthcare ""always on.""","Philip Settimi doesn’t run a hospital, but he thinks like someone who does. As CEO of PartsSource, a healthcare technology company serving over 5,000 hospitals across the US, Settimi brings a supply chain mindset to one of the most overlooked drivers of clinical performance: asset uptime.

“We're improving the clinical availability of mission critical assets around US healthcare every day,” Settimi said during a recent interview. He noted that the company “started as an e-commerce and distribution platform for parts” but that mission has since evolved.

Since joining PartsSource in 2014—after leading roles at GE Healthcare IT, Hospira, and Hill-Rom—Settimi has transformed the company from a parts supplier into a digital health infrastructure provider. Under his leadership, the company launched a single enterprise platform that consolidates vendor management, service coordination, and performance benchmarking across systems. Health systems like Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic, and Providence are now enterprise clients using PartsSource Pro, which Settimi says brings cost, quality, and productivity improvements at scale.

His strategy is to digitize and simplify the complex vendor environment in hospitals. “An average hospital is managing 150 service contracts. 75% percent of those are relatively low dollar and long tail... offline and analog,” Settimi explained. Hospitals, he noted, are left tracking down field service reports manually and often lack performance metrics on vendors.

To address this, PartsSource has built decision-support tools that sit on top of over “three billion data points” collected over two decades. These tools help hospitals select vendors, monitor performance, and optimize supply chain preferences through formulary management, akin to the way pharmacy benefit managers operate.

“Every transaction is tracked from a performance perspective,” he said, allowing clients to benchmark against national peers.

Settimi’s long-term vision draws on his operational experience across industries. At GE and Hospira, he worked on device/software integration and medical supply chains. At PartsSource, he’s applying that knowledge to HTM (healthcare technology management), a field he believes is key to fixing healthcare’s broader cost and efficiency problem. “We believe HTM has a key role in that mission, not just at the table but leading the way,” he highlighted.

For Settimi, the operating room starts with operations. And he’s betting that better data and smarter supply chains are what will keep healthcare ""always on.""",https://thehealthcaretechnologyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Philip-Settimi.png,N,,2025-07-15 09:03:38.626301

Despite these shifts, Satisfaction scores remained stable, with Kraft averaging 41.4 and General Mills at 40.4.
Both Kraft’s and General Mills’ Quality scores held steady during this period.
Conversely, Kraft maintained a steady Value score, whereas General Mills saw a drop.","Kraft Heinz recently announced the removal of artificial dyes from core products such as Lunchables and Kraft Mac & Cheese. General Mills echoed similar intentions following an April announcement from the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary outlining plans to phase out eight synthetic food dyes from the national food supply. Recent data from YouGov Profiles provides insight into how current customers of both brands view food additives, product labeling, pricing around cleaner ingredients, and public perception of both brands.

Cautious attitudes toward additives

A significant portion of Kraft customers are skeptical about food additives: 49% disagree with the idea that GMOs or additives are harmless, while only 25% agree. The remaining 26% are neutral, indicating ongoing uncertainty or ambivalence.

General Mills customers display similar skepticism. A majority (55%) disagree with the idea that additives are harmless; 25% agree, and 20% remain neutral.

Mixed willingness to pay for additive-free products

Consumers of both brands show varied willingness to pay more for products free of artificial additives. Among Kraft customers, 45% are willing to pay a premium, while 40% are not. General Mills customers show greater readiness: 56% say they’re willing to pay more, compared to 30% who are not.

High label awareness

Both consumer groups exhibit a strong tendency to examine product labels. A majority of Kraft (54%) and General Mills (54%) customers say they read food labels and ingredient lists, while only about a quarter of each group (24% and 23%, respectively) say they do not.

These insights suggest that consumers of both brands are paying attention, even if their opinions on additives or spending may differ. As Kraft Heinz removes synthetic dyes from its products, the label-conscious behavior of its customers means such changes are likely to be noticed, even among those who may not strongly oppose additives or prioritize paying more for natural alternatives.

Let’s look at how both brands have fared in the past month since the announcement

YouGov BrandIndex data indicates a modest decline in overall brand perception for both Kraft Heinz and General Mills before the announcements. However, since the announcement, each brand’s Index score — which averages public perception across Impression, Satisfaction, Quality, Reputation, Value, and Recommendation — has since fully recovered.

Kraft’s Impression score increased from 40.4 on June 17 (the day of the announcement) to 47.1 on July 13. General Mills saw a similar increase, from 37.2 to 40.9. Despite these shifts, Satisfaction scores remained stable, with Kraft averaging 41.4 and General Mills at 40.4.

According to a report by Reuters, the Wall Street bank's profit applicable to shareholders reached $1.39 billion, or $1.93 per share, up from $1.14 billion, or $1.52 per share, a year earlier. This growth was supported by a late-quarter rally in the equity market and improved sentiment due to potential trade deals and rate cuts.

BNY Mellon's assets under custody and administration saw a 13% increase, reaching $55.8 trillion by the end of June. This rise was attributed to higher market values, client inflows, and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The bank's total revenue surpassed $5 billion for the first time in a quarter, marking a 9% increase. Net interest income also rose by 17%, surpassing analysts' expectations of 11.8% growth.

The bank's asset servicing business, which is crucial for the safekeeping and settlement of trades, posted a 7% increase in revenue. Additionally, the issuer services segment, which aids clients in issuing securities, reported a 17% rise. Overall, total fee revenue increased by 7% to $3.64 billion compared to the same period last year.

BNY Mellon's CEO, Robin Vince, highlighted the bank's ongoing transformation and commercial success, noting that the new commercial model launched last year has led to record sales in the first half of the year. While custodian banks like BNY play a vital role in global markets, the bank has been exploring potential mergers, including a reported approach to Northern Trust. However, analysts suggest regulatory challenges could hinder such a merger, and BNY may look at other acquisition targets.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2025-07-15 12:33:05.942808

The company allowed him to travel in from his home in Newport Beach, California, to its head office in Seattle via a private jet instead of relocating.","Starbucks has ordered its corporate staff to work from the office at least four days a week from late September and is offering cash payments to those who choose to quit instead.

Brian Niccol, the chief executive of the Seattle-headquartered coffee chain, said many of its employees would be required to work in the office for a minimum of four days a week, up from three, from Monday to Thursday. This will apply to its Seattle and Toronto support centres and regional offices in North America.

“We do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in a message to employees, referred to as “partners”, on the company’s website on “re-establishing an in-office culture”. “We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams.”

He added: “Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

The four-day office policy will come into effect on 29 September. Niccol, who has been in the job for almost a year, has said he wants to take Starbucks back to its coffeehouse roots by improving customers’ experience in its cafes and reducing reliance on mobile and takeaway orders.

He said: “We know we’re asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.

“To support those who decide to ‘opt out’, we’re offering a one-time voluntary exit programme with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.” The company did not state the size of the sum.

In February, the company asked its vice-presidents who were working remotely to move to Seattle or Toronto. It is now extending this requirement to all support centre “people leaders”, who are expected to relocate within 12 months.

In its previous announcement, Starbucks set out plans to lay off 1,100 corporate employees and close several hundred open or vacant job positions, the biggest job cuts in its history, in order to reduce costs as it struggled with rising inflation and economic uncertainty.

Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, including coffee roasters and warehouse staff. It employs about 360,000 people worldwide, including 5,600 in the UK, most of whom work in its cafes.

The Barclays Consumer Spend research in this press release was carried out between 27th June – 2nd July 2025 by Opinium Research on behalf of Barclays.","Confidence in household finances reached its highest point since February, as consumers shored up their finances in light of the current economic outlook

These budgeting behaviours led essential spend to contract -2.1 per cent, while soaring temperatures did not translate into a typical high street bounce

Health & beauty and furniture grew by 10.1 per cent and 8.2 per cent, outperforming overall retail

Cinemas had a blockbuster month up 26.9 per cent following the release of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and How to Train Your Dragon

The Barclays Consumer Spend report combines hundreds of millions of customer transactions with consumer research to provide an in-depth view of UK spending

Consumer card spending fell -0.1 per cent year-on-year in June, less than the 1.0 per cent reported in May and below the latest CPIH inflation rate of 4.0 per cent. Confidence in household finances improved six percentage points to 73 per cent – a four-month high. Meanwhile, essential spend contracted -2.1 per cent, down from -1.1 per cent in May. The onset of summer festivals, weddings and sporting events contributed to a marginal 0.8 per cent increase in non-essential spending, led by the strong performance of entertainment and health & beauty.

Despite England’s warmest June on record, spend growth was muted; the 0.8 per cent rise in discretionary spend represents the lowest growth since November 2024 (also 0.8 per cent). Although sunshine typically encourages trips to the high street, the overall eating & drinking category decreased -0.5 per cent, while retail was flat, growing just 0.2 per cent. This comes as almost three in 10 (28 per cent) said they would cut spending on restaurant meals and new clothes and accessories respectively.

Consumers brace for rising costs

UK consumers’ confidence in their household finances and ability to live within their means reached their highest points since February, at 73 per cent and 76 per cent respectively. Taking steps to shore up their finances, seven in 10 (69 per cent) have made financial adjustments in light of the current economic outlook, with one in three (34 per cent) building a savings buffer in case costs rise.

In response to the Government’s June 2025 Spending Review, a quarter (27 per cent) expect their energy bills to go up, and a fifth (19 per cent) anticipate their essential spending will increase. Separately, three quarters (76 per cent) are concerned about the impact of ongoing geo-political instability on their household finances.

Furniture stores shine

Despite a slower month for retail, furniture stores enjoyed a particularly strong June, up 8.2 per cent – the category’s highest increase since March 2022. This is potentially due to new homeowners furnishing their new properties; record numbers of mortgage completions took place in March 2025, particularly among first-time buyers, where completions jumped 70 per cent compared to February, ahead of April’s stamp duty changes.

Pharmacy, health & beauty also bucked the overall retail trend, up 10.1 per cent likely in part due to the purchase of seasonal staples such as hay fever medication, suncream and everyday cosmetics; three in 10 (28 per cent) shoppers reported spending more on suncream in June, with 18 per cent upping spending on hay fever medication.

Summer blockbusters provide cinemas with seasonal boost

The overall hospitality and leisure sector grew 2.1 per cent year-on-year, led by the strong performance of entertainment, up 8.0 per cent. Live shows & concerts grew 2.5 per cent, as one in five (18 per cent) UK adults said they would be spending money to attend summer concerts and events such as Beyonce, Dua Lipa and Pitbull, at an average of £160.80 in total each.

Cinema spend increased 26.9 per cent, owing to highly anticipated blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and How to Train Your Dragon. With a summer of sport well under way, the small screen also fared well. Digital content & subscriptions saw growth of 7.0 per cent, helped by subscription-only sports viewing of Formula 1 and the British & Irish Lions rugby tour.

Karen Johnson, Head of Retail at Barclays, said: “Despite the warm weather, which usually boosts non-essential sectors such as retail and hospitality, consumers spent cautiously in June, prioritising value as they navigate economic uncertainty. Encouragingly, entertainment, beauty and furniture stores bucked the trend, while confidence in household finances improved, showing consumers’ willingness to spend on the things that matter most to them.”

Jack Meaning, Chief UK Economist at Barclays, said: “The economy has cooled throughout through Q2, but our data does show pockets of strength. However, with both global and domestic uncertainty, and temporarily heightened inflation likely to continue, consumers are remaining cautious and maintaining savings buffers. We expect this to lead to limited GDP growth for the remainder of this year, before falling interest rates and a stronger sense of certainty drive a return to growth next year.”

Notes to Editors

Across its issuing and acquiring businesses, Barclays sees nearly 40 per cent of the nation’s credit and debit card transactions, which provides us with unique insight into UK consumer spending. Unless stated otherwise, this press release is based on consumer card spending data from Barclays’ issuing business – i.e. Barclays debit card and Barclaycard credit card transactions. It relates to the period 24th May 2025 – 27th June 2025 vs 25th May 2024 – 28th June 2024.

The Barclays Consumer Spend research in this press release was carried out between 27th June – 2nd July 2025 by Opinium Research on behalf of Barclays. There were 2,000 respondents in each round of research, providing a representative sample of UK consumers by age, gender, region, and income group. Barclays has been tracking consumer confidence since December 2015. The net confidence measures have been calculated by adding together the responses of those said they were feeling “fairly confident” or “very confident”.

Glossary

We have provided below a glossary of certain terms used in this press release:

Carriers: Number of unique air and ocean carriers, mostly airlines, that have been sellers of transactions. For airlines, we count booking carriers, which include separate airlines within the same carrier group. We do not count dozens of other airlines that operate individual segments of air cargo transactions, as we do not have a direct booking relationship with them. Carriers include ocean less-than-container load (LCL) consolidators. In addition, we only count carriers when more than five bookings were placed with them over the course of a calendar quarter.

Unique buyer users: Number of individual users placing bookings, typically counted based on unique email logins. The number of buyers, which counts unique customer businesses, does not reflect the fact that some buyers are large multinational organizations while others are small or midsize businesses. Therefore, we find it more useful to monitor the number of unique buyer users than the number of buyer businesses.

GBV: Total value of transactions on the Freightos platform, which is the monetary value of freight and related services contracted between buyers and sellers on the Freightos platform, plus related fees charged to buyers and sellers, and pass-through payments such as duties. GBV is converted to U.S. dollars at the time of each transaction on the Freightos platform. This metric may be similar to what others call gross merchandise value (GMV) or gross services volume (GSV). We believe that this metric reflects the scale of the Freightos platform and our opportunities to generate platform revenue.

Transactions: Number of bookings for freight services, and related services, placed by Buyers across the Freightos platform with third-party sellers and with Clearit. Sellers of Transactions include Carriers (that is, airlines, ocean liners and LCL consolidators) and also other providers of freight services such as trucking companies, freight forwarders, general sales agents, and air master loaders. The number of transactions booked on the Freightos platform in any given time period is net of transactions that were canceled prior to the end of the period. Transactions booked on white label portals hosted by Freightos are included if there is a transactional fee associated with them.

The snapshot from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed total sales grew by 3.1% year on year in June, after a sharp drop in May, as record-breaking temperatures and promotional offers encouraged consumers to spend.

Official figures showed UK retail sales collapsed by 2.7% in May, the sharpest monthly decline in almost two years, in a “dismal” month for supermarkets as the economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1%.

However, the BRC said June’s high temperatures helped to “heat up” consumer spending. The total value of food sales rose by 4.1% year on year, although this partly reflected fast-rising food prices pushing up the cost of a supermarket shopping basket.

Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “The soaring temperatures increased sales of electric fans while sports and leisure equipment was boosted by the weather and the start of Wimbledon.

“Food sales remained strong, though this was in part driven by food inflation, which has risen steadily over the course of the year.”

Households have come under pressure from lingering high inflation, adding to already elevated living costs, after tax rises and increases in bills. Consumer confidence has also been hit by uncertainty over sluggish growth, a cooling UK jobs market and Donald Trump’s trade wars.

Separate figures from Barclays showed consumer card spending – which takes into account broader spending on hospitality and leisure alongside retail – fell 0.1% year on year in June.

Highlighting evidence of consumer caution, it said essential spending – including food and fuel – fell 2.1%.

However, the bank, which processes almost 40% of UK credit and debit card transactions, said there were signs of rising consumer confidence and willingness to spend on experiences.

The onset of summer festivals, weddings and sporting events contributed to a marginal 0.8% increase in non-essential spending, led by the strong performance of entertainment and health and beauty. Hospitality and leisure spending grew 2.1%, helped by live shows from Beyoncé and Pitbull, and huge outdoor concerts in Hyde Park.

Spending on furniture rose sharply, reflecting new homeowners furnishing their properties after a rush to complete purchases before the expiry of a temporary cut in stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland at the end of March.

A survey of 2,000 adults by Barclays showed confidence in household finances improved by six percentage points to 73% – a four-month high.

While the Long Steel division faces an uncertain future, ArcelorMittal South Africa's overall financial performance shows some signs of improvement, albeit while remaining in loss-making territory.
As the September 30, 2025 deadline approaches, several potential scenarios could unfold for ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division.

The Flat Steel division has shown better performance, with production increases following the restoration of Blast Furnace C, while the Long Steel division faces more severe challenges.","The Uncertain Future of ArcelorMittal's Long Steel Business

ArcelorMittal South Africa has issued a stark update regarding its Long Steel division, warning that the business faces an uncertain future as its financial lifeline nears exhaustion. The R1.683 billion facility provided by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) has now been fully utilized, leaving the company at a critical juncture.

Unless significant structural and financial interventions are implemented by September 30, 2025, ArcelorMittal may proceed with an orderly wind-down of its Long Steel operations. Despite these challenges, the company has committed to continuing operations through the third quarter of 2025 to honor existing customer commitments.

The potential closure represents a significant shift in South Africa's steel industry landscape, with downstream implications for construction, infrastructure development, and manufacturing sectors that rely on domestically produced long steel products.

""The Long Steel division's continued viability hinges on addressing fundamental market and operational challenges that have persistently undermined its competitiveness,"" notes the company in its latest trading update.

Structural Market Constraints Plaguing the Long Steel Division

Several entrenched market dynamics have contributed to the division's precarious position. Chief among these is the difficulty in securing competitively priced scrap metal, a critical raw material for long steel production. The pricing structure for scrap metal in South Africa has disadvantaged domestic steel producers compared to international competitors.

This challenge is compounded by persistently weak demand for long steel products in the South African market. Construction activity, a primary consumer of long steel products such as rebar and structural sections, has remained subdued due to broader economic conditions and delays in infrastructure projects.

The division also continues to face intense competition from imported steel products flooding the local market. Despite various steel tariff exemptions for some countries, the tariff protection framework has proven insufficient to create a level playing field for domestic producers. These imports often arrive at prices that domestic manufacturers struggle to match due to their higher operational costs.

Operational Obstacles Creating Unsustainable Cost Pressures

Beyond market constraints, ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division grapples with severe operational challenges that have significantly increased its cost base:

Rail service deterioration: Transnet's rail service has reached unprecedented poor levels, severely affecting the company's logistics capabilities

Infrastructure failures: Persistent cable theft and locomotive breakdowns have disrupted supply chains

Logistics cost burden: Additional logistics expenses amounting to R317 million have been incurred due to transportation challenges

Energy cost disadvantage: Electricity expenses significantly higher than international competitors, undermining global competitiveness

The rail service challenges are particularly damaging, as they affect both incoming raw materials and outgoing finished products. Despite some rail service improvements in other regions, the company has been forced to utilize more expensive road transportation alternatives, resulting in the R317 million in additional logistics costs that have directly impacted the division's bottom line.

How Has the Six-Month Deferral Period Performed?

In March 2025, ArcelorMittal South Africa announced a six-month extension for its Long Steel division, aimed at exploring sustainable solutions while maintaining operations. This period was supported by the R1.683 billion facility from the IDC, providing a temporary financial cushion.

However, the company has now reported that minimal progress has been achieved in addressing the core challenges facing the division. The fundamental market constraints and operational obstacles remain largely unchanged, calling into question the division's long-term viability.

""Despite concerted efforts to identify sustainable solutions, the structural challenges facing the Long Steel division have proven resistant to short-term interventions,"" states the company's latest update.

Given the limited progress, ArcelorMittal has indicated that it might initiate wind-down preparations before the September 30 deadline if the outlook doesn't improve. This proactive approach aims to ensure an orderly transition that minimizes disruption to customers and stakeholders.

Business Continuity Through the Transition Period

Despite the uncertain future, ArcelorMittal has emphasized its commitment to honoring existing customer orders through the third quarter of 2025. This approach aims to provide customers with adequate time to secure alternative supply arrangements and minimize disruption to their operations.

The company plans to release its full interim financial results on July 31, 2025, which will provide more comprehensive details about the division's performance and future prospects. According to recent warnings from AMSA, approximately 3,500 jobs could be at risk if the Long Steel division were to close, highlighting the significant social impact of such a decision.

What is ArcelorMittal South Africa's Current Financial Position?

While the Long Steel division faces an uncertain future, ArcelorMittal South Africa's overall financial performance shows some signs of improvement, albeit while remaining in loss-making territory.

Trading Statement Highlights

According to the company's trading statement, interim loss per share is expected to improve by 15-25% year-on-year. Current projections indicate a loss of between R0.82 and R0.93 per share, compared to the R1.09 per share loss reported in the corresponding period of 2024.

Similarly, headline loss per share is forecast to be between R0.89 and R0.99, an improvement from the R1.00 per share headline loss recorded in the first half of 2024. These figures suggest that while the company continues to face challenges, there has been some moderation in its financial difficulties.

The company will release its unaudited results on the JSE's Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) by the end of July, providing investors and stakeholders with a more comprehensive picture of its financial health.

Operational Performance Metrics

On the operational front, ArcelorMittal South Africa has reported several notable developments:

Safety improvements: The lost-time injury frequency rate has been reduced significantly to 0.44, down from 1.13 in the first half of 2024, reflecting enhanced workplace safety protocols

Flat Steel production gains: Double-digit increases in production volumes following the restoration of Blast Furnace C, demonstrating operational improvements in this segment

Sales volume challenges: Approximately 10% year-on-year reduction in overall sales volumes, primarily attributed to weaker market demand

Price pressure persistence: Realized prices in rand terms more than 5% lower than in 2024, reflecting continued competitive pressures in the market

The improved safety performance stands out as a positive achievement amid the company's broader challenges, highlighting effective implementation of safety protocols and procedures.

How Does This Situation Compare to Previous Steel Industry Challenges?

The current challenges facing ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division reflect broader historical patterns in the global steel industry, which has long been characterized by cyclical boom and bust periods. However, several factors make the present situation particularly challenging.

The global steel industry has undergone significant restructuring over the past several decades, with consolidation and capacity rationalization becoming common responses to market overcapacity and pricing pressures. Many mature steel markets, including those in Europe and North America, have previously faced similar decisions regarding legacy steel assets.

South Africa's manufacturing sector has faced persistent pressures from infrastructure challenges, energy constraints, and global competition. The Trump tariffs impact on the global steel industry has further complicated the situation, creating additional market distortions. The country's steel industry has attempted various restructuring efforts in the past, but the current combination of challenges appears particularly severe.

Comparative Analysis with Other Steel Producers

Regional competitiveness factors significantly influence steel producers' viability. South African operations face unique challenges compared to their regional and global peers, including higher energy costs, logistics constraints, and limited domestic market size.

Global steel market dynamics continue to be shaped by significant capacity additions in countries like China, creating persistent pricing pressures across international markets. Ongoing US–China trade tensions have further disrupted global trade flows, affecting markets worldwide. This global context makes it increasingly difficult for higher-cost producers to remain competitive without specialized product offerings or protected markets.

What Are the Potential Outcomes for the Long Steel Division?

As the September 30, 2025 deadline approaches, several potential scenarios could unfold for ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division.

Scenario Analysis

A complete wind-down remains the most likely outcome if significant interventions are not implemented by the deadline. This would involve the systematic closure of facilities and cessation of operations in an orderly manner.

Partial restructuring options might also be considered, potentially maintaining operations at the most efficient facilities while closing others. This approach could preserve some capacity and jobs while reducing the overall cost base.

The possibility of a strategic buyer emerging remains, though industry conditions make this challenging. A buyer with complementary operations or specialized market focus might see value in specific assets.

Government intervention could also play a role, given the strategic importance of steel production to South Africa's industrial base and the significant employment implications. Australia's tariff counterplan for similar situations may provide instructive lessons, though fiscal constraints may limit the scope of potential support measures.

Impact Assessment

The closure of ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division would have significant implications for South Africa's steel supply chain. Downstream industries and customers would need to secure alternative supply sources, potentially leading to increased reliance on imports.

The employment consequences would be substantial, with approximately 3,500 direct jobs at risk, not counting the indirect employment effects on suppliers and service providers.

The resulting market gap would likely be filled by imports and potentially by other domestic producers if they can expand capacity. However, this transition could lead to short-term supply disruptions and price volatility.

The broader economic ripple effects would extend beyond the steel industry, affecting communities where ArcelorMittal's facilities are located and potentially further weakening South Africa's manufacturing base.

FAQ: ArcelorMittal's Long Steel Division Situation

What is the difference between ArcelorMittal's Flat Steel and Long Steel businesses?

Flat steel products include sheets and plates used in automotive manufacturing, appliances, and construction, while long steel products encompass bars, rods, rails, and structural sections primarily used in construction and infrastructure projects. The Flat Steel division has shown better performance, with production increases following the restoration of Blast Furnace C, while the Long Steel division faces more severe challenges.

How significant is the Long Steel Division to ArcelorMittal South Africa's overall operations?

The Long Steel Division represents a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal South Africa's business, with significant production capacity and workforce. Its potential closure would mark a major restructuring of the company's operations in South Africa, affecting approximately 3,500 jobs and reshaping the domestic steel market landscape.

What external factors are contributing to the division's challenges?

External factors include global steel overcapacity creating pricing pressures, economic slowdown affecting construction activity and steel demand, infrastructure challenges in South Africa (particularly rail transportation), electricity supply issues and cost, and logistical constraints. Transnet's deteriorating rail service has directly resulted in R317 million in additional logistics costs for the company.

What alternatives might exist to complete closure?

Alternatives could include partial operation of more efficient facilities, strategic partnerships with other industry players, government support programs, or restructuring to focus on higher-margin specialty products. However, the company has indicated that minimal progress has been made in identifying sustainable alternatives during the six-month deferral period, suggesting limited viable options remain.

""The structural challenges facing South Africa's steel industry require coordinated action from multiple stakeholders, including government, infrastructure providers, and the private sector,"" industry analysts note.

Ndlangiso, on behalf of his company, bought a car from BMW and then seemingly defaulted on the payments, causing the car maker’s financial services unit to go after him and repose the car.
The judge found that BMW’s delay was reasonably explained, and the time frame was “minimal”.
On this basis, the judge found that BMW had effectively affirmed the agreement.
“Against this backdrop, I find that BMW’s insistence on return of the vehicle despite having received the arrears is neither equitable nor in the public interest,” the court said in its ruling.","BMW Financial Services has lost a court bid to repossess a vehicle from Ndlangisa Funeral Services CC and its sole member, Lungisani Ndlangiso, after the Pietermaritzburg High Court found that the financial services company’s actions weren’t fair or in the public interest.

Ndlangiso, on behalf of his company, bought a car from BMW and then seemingly defaulted on the payments, causing the car maker’s financial services unit to go after him and repose the car.

However, BMW filed some of its paperwork to repossess the car eight months late, after the initial court matter to get summary judgement against Ndlangiso started, which it said was because it couldn’t get the relevant person to sign the document because the deponent was “based in another province, causing a logistical delay.

“The explanation is that the affidavit had been timeously commissioned in Gauteng, but delays arose due to the deponent’s availability and physical transmission to KwaZulu-Natal for filing,” the ruling said.

The judge found that BMW’s delay was reasonably explained, and the time frame was “minimal”. “Importantly, the application was electronically served within time,” the court noted.

However, where the judge took umbrage with the matter was that BMW’s late filing could only be condoned if it had a reasonable chance of success in repossessing the car, which it didn’t.

The court noted that the arrears had already been paid by the time BMW applied for summary judgment, and that the company had continued to accept monthly instalments. On this basis, the judge found that BMW had effectively affirmed the agreement.

“Against this backdrop, I find that BMW’s insistence on return of the vehicle despite having received the arrears is neither equitable nor in the public interest,” the court said in its ruling.

The judge added: “Enforcement in such circumstances serves no purpose other than to punish the consumer and is entirely at odds with the rehabilitative and equitable principles that underpin both the NCA [National Consumer Act] and public policy.”

The court dismissed the summary judgment application and granted Ndlangisa Funeral Services and Ndlangiso leave to defend the application to have the car repossessed.

Since 2016, the Independent Agency Search & Selection Company (IAS) Credentials Award has recognised agencies that get the fundamentals right.

“Too many agencies skip the hard thinking on positioning and culture and end up with a deck that’s all noise and no narrative.” So, how do you build credentials that reflect culture, not just competence?
“It took time, discussion and field-testing, but that’s how you get to the story that actually resonates.” The IAS Credentials Award isn’t just a trophy - it’s a benchmark.","In reality, your credentials deck is the work. Often the first thing a client sees - and sometimes the only thing. It shapes perception before you’ve said a word. And if it doesn’t pulse with your agency’s culture, perspective and people, you’re not just forgettable - you’re invisible.

Since 2016, the Independent Agency Search & Selection Company (IAS) Credentials Award has recognised agencies that get the fundamentals right. Relaunched in partnership with DMASA in 2020, it has become a fixture in the Assegai Awards, and 2025 marks a decade of successful collaboration. This isn’t about sizzle for sizzle’s sake; the award celebrates thinking that’s sharp, not showy - stories that reveal, not just sell.

And here’s the point: the award is judged by marketers - the people you actually need to convince. That gives it weight. It’s a benchmark for relevance, not just recognition.

“Credentials should tell the full story of your agency - not just what you’ve done, but who you are,” says IAS CEO Johanna McDowell. “Too many agencies skip the hard thinking on positioning and culture and end up with a deck that’s all noise and no narrative.”

So, how do you build credentials that reflect culture, not just competence? Culture is often confused with perks or aesthetics - the beanbags, the playlists, the dog-friendly policies. That’s not what this is about. It’s the intangible edge that makes a client say, Yes, this feels right. It should be visible in every line of your deck. Every frame of your reel. Not as a bolt-on, but as a spine.

Start with clarity. Why do you exist? What are you solving for? Then shape your story around the people who bring that to life: leadership, teams, dynamics, thinking. Drop the posturing. Replace it with insight. Less corporate jargon, more agency DNA.

Let the case studies breathe. Not just what the campaign achieved, but how the relationship worked. The late-night pivots, the creative friction, the choices that made it better. Show your process, not just your polish.

And for global agencies: don’t assume international credentials travel well. What sings in New York might fall flat in Joburg. Culture needs local roots to ring true.

“We needed our own interpretation of the story within the South African and African context,” says Jonty Fisher, SVP at Publicis Groupe Africa, on reworking Saatchi & Saatchi’s local credentials. “It took time, discussion and field-testing, but that’s how you get to the story that actually resonates.”

The IAS Credentials Award isn’t just a trophy - it’s a benchmark. As Pete Case, CEO of Ogilvy South Africa, puts it, “We don’t often see how we stack up. This award gives us that measure. We enter every year to test our relevance, get feedback from marketers and see if what we’re putting into market still lands. If we win, we know we’re truly resonating with clients.”

And that matters - because your credentials live longer than your pitch. They’re passed around, pulled apart and revisited in rooms you’re not in. If they don’t hold up without you, they never held up at all.

So cut the jargon. Lead with truth. Make culture visible, deliberate, loud.

Great creative gets you attention. Culture gets you trust.",https://biz-file.com/c/2507/779909.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 12:36:58.861324

It’s not a stretch to foresee a similar fate befalling Kraft Heinz, post-spinoff.
Kraft Heinz as of 2023 employed more than 3,300 in Illinois, including at the Chicago headquarters and a research and development operation in north suburban Glenview.
The Tribune recognized Kraft Heinz as one of the area’s top workplaces in that year.
JB Pritzker that Kraft Heinz is taking this understandable step to improve shareholder value.","At the dawn of this century, Mayor Richard M. Daley knew he had a problem. Too many Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Chicago had been sold to out-of-town rivals. In the late 1990s into 2000, longtime local corporate titans like Amoco, Ameritech, Quaker Oats and Waste Management were gobbled in the merger mania that pervaded.

Chicago always seemed to come out on the losing end of the dealmaking frenzy. Back then, the circumstances of the various corporate losses weren’t generally tied to the health, fiscal or otherwise, of the city itself, but collectively the deals gave Chicago the image of a city in decline.

So when Boeing delivered the shocking news in 2001 that it was leaving its longtime home of Seattle, launching a nationwide beauty contest to land the corporate headquarters, Daley was all in. More than $60 million in taxpayer subsidies later, Chicago won the prize.

The victory, while a boost to the city’s self-confidence at the time, proved short-lived. Boeing dumped Chicago for the Washington, D.C., area in 2022.

Fast-forward to the present and Chicago again is suffering the loss or diminishment of locally based corporations via dealmaking and (more worryingly) executives and boards simply moving their bases to more business-friendly cities.

That’s why the seemingly innocuous news, broken Friday by The Wall Street Journal, that Chicago-based Kraft Heinz plans to split in two is quite likely to be a negative for Chicago. The packaged-foods giant itself is the product of a merger of two well-known brand names — Kraft and Heinz — in 2015. Chicago, longtime home to Kraft Foods, was the winner in that mashup, serving as the headquarters city rather than Heinz’s home of Pittsburgh. The company owns lots of household brand names and products, like Heinz ketchup, Kraft macaroni and cheese, Kool-Aid, Oscar Mayer, Jell-O and Maxwell House.

Some of those products are growing, and some are struggling. Kraft Heinz management, confronting pressure to do something about a stock price that’s plateaued after losing much of its value years ago, wants to stash the slower-growing brands in one company and the higher-performing brands in another. It’s a textbook Wall Street maneuver to “unlock the value” of stronger businesses housed within sprawling corporations.

If history (and very recent history at that) is a guide, one or both of the Kraft Heinz units following the corporate breakup will be takeover targets. That makes the odds better than even that Chicago ultimately will lose another corporate headquarters once the dominoes fall.

Consider the recent experience of another familiar name: Kellogg. Founded in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1876, the company known best for its breakfast cereals spun off its snacks business into a separate publicly traded company based in Chicago in 2023. That seemed like a bit of a coup for Chicago (especially given the surfeit of bad news at the time such as the departure of Caterpillar to Texas and Ken Griffin’s Citadel empire to Miami). But Chicago proved but a rest stop on the road to a sale.

Just a year later, Kellanova, as the Chicago unit was named, agreed to be acquired by McLean, Virginia-based Mars. The cereals maker, still named Kellogg and based in Battle Creek, agreed just last week to sell to Ferrero Rocher, based in Italy.

Kellogg shareholders are positioned to do well through the strategy. Chicago? Mars says its global snacks president, already based in Chicago, will oversee Kellanova’s snacks business and continue to be based here following closure of the deal, which has yet to take place due to a rigorous antitrust review in the European Union. But no doubt there will be positions cut because of corporate overlap.

We’ll see how Battle Creek fares after the Kellogg deal is completed.

It’s not a stretch to foresee a similar fate befalling Kraft Heinz, post-spinoff. Transforming large conglomerates into more affordable and digestible takeover targets is an essential part of the spinoff strategy.

Kraft Heinz as of 2023 employed more than 3,300 in Illinois, including at the Chicago headquarters and a research and development operation in north suburban Glenview. The Tribune recognized Kraft Heinz as one of the area’s top workplaces in that year.

It’s not the fault of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson or Gov. JB Pritzker that Kraft Heinz is taking this understandable step to improve shareholder value.

But what Illinois and — to a greater extent — Chicago aren’t doing well enough is establishing and nurturing a business environment that makes Chicago an attractive place to locate a business, be it an existing corporation or a startup. So when companies like Kraft Heinz take steps that could result in a business loss for us but otherwise have nothing to do with Chicago as a business destination, we can point to other examples where Chicago turned out the winner.

Today the narrative about Chicago’s business environment focuses overwhelmingly on holding onto what we have rather than adding more “top workplaces.” That needs to change.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CTC-L-CT-ct-biz-top-workplaces-kraft-heinz-profile008_176399677.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-07-15 08:01:08.169838

Brand’s CEO and chairman, Toni Ruiz said that Helena’s unmatched experience, international viewpoint, and forward-thinking leadership will be a perfect fit for Mango. He added that her vision will be incredibly valuable as they continue to grow and drive the business globally.

Helmersson, who led H&M as CEO from 2020 to 2024, brings over two decades of international experience in fashion, with expertise spanning sustainability, global operations, and supply chain management.

Her hiring follows a wider leadership overhaul at Mango. Over the past few weeks, the retailer promoted Eva Gallego to lead its women’s unit, after the departure of veteran executive Elena Carasso. The creation of Gallego’s new position is viewed by some as key to reinforcing Mango’s foundation product line.

Therefore, we appreciate and warmly appreciate Danone Indonesia's support and collaboration in providing infrastructure and clean water access facilities.
For more than two decades, Danone Indonesia has presented access to clean water to villages in NTT.
We believe the availability of access to clean water and drinking water is closely related to the health and quality of life of the community.
Realizing the limited resources of the community to process clean water into safe drinking water, Danone Indonesia also collaborated with NAZAVA to distribute a total of 1,500 safe drinking water filters (water filters) to various regions in NTT.","JAKARTA - Drinking water and sanitation are one of the main priorities in sustainable development goals in Indonesia. In line with the commitment to bring health to as many Indonesians as possible, Danone Indonesia in collaboration with the Provincial Government of East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), Kupang Regency and South Central Timor Regency along with partners of the Community Care Network Foundation (JPM), the Muhammadiyah Community Empowerment Council (MPM), Nazava and Mitra Dhuafa Cooperatives (Komida) today inaugurated clean water facilities and handed over safe drinking water facilities at SD GMIT Oenaek, Kupang, NTT.

The inauguration was also attended by Retno Marsudi, the Special Envoy for the Secretary General of the United Nations (UN) for Water Affairs; and Gita Sabharwal - UN Resident Coordinator for Indonesia.

The inauguration of clean water facilities in the villages of Oenaek and Sumlili, Kupang Regency, was carried out as part of efforts to prevent stunting in NTT which had started in 2020. To ensure that people have access to safe drinking water both at the household level and when doing activities in public facilities, Danone Indonesia also handed over safe drinking water facilities in the form of Nazava water sievery for people in Kupang Regency and South Central Timor (TTS).

Retno Marsudi, Special Envoy for the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) for Water, explained that access to drinking water is still an urgent challenge at the global and national levels.

""BP data shows that 1 in 4 people do not have access to clean water, and every day 1,000 children under 5 years die from this limitation, with the death rate due to diarrhea 3 times higher than violence. In Indonesia alone, access to clean water is also one of the challenges we face. In responding to this challenge, collaboration between the government and all parties, including the private sector, plays an important role. Therefore, we appreciate and warmly appreciate Danone Indonesia's support and collaboration in providing infrastructure and clean water access facilities. Hopefully, this synergy can be stronger to overcome water issues in various regions in Indonesia,"" he explained, in a written statement,

The Governor of NTT, represented by the Head of the NTT Provincial Health Office, drg. Iin Anggraeni, also appreciated this collaboration.

For more than two decades, Danone Indonesia has presented access to clean water to villages in NTT. Danone Indonesia has not stopped and continues to contribute through stunting prevention programs that include education, training, providing access to nutrients, to the establishment of the Village Stunting Monitoring Team. Until now, this program has reached around 20 villages in Kupang and has begun to expand to other regions in NTT. We hope that people who are scattered in various regions in NTT can feel the impact, and live a healthier life.

We believe the availability of access to clean water and drinking water is closely related to the health and quality of life of the community. As part of our commitment to Danone Impact Journey to create health impacts through hydration and nutrition as well as support the efforts of the Indonesian government and SDGs in achieving the target of access to drinking water is feasible and safe; we hope that by inaugurating clean water facilities and handing over safe drinking water facilities in the form of water filters, it can encourage a reduction in stunting rates, and improve the health of the people of NTT, in particular, in areas that have limited access,"" said Vera.

Galuh Sugijanto, VP General Secretary of Danone Indonesia. Data from the 2022 Indonesian Nutrition Status Survey (SSGI) recorded NTT as the province with the highest stunting prevalence rate of 35.3 percent. Therefore, supporting efforts to reduce and handle stunting prevalence in NTT, Danone Indonesia has been running stunting prevention programs since 2020.

This initiative has reached more than 79 thousand beneficiaries through educational activities as well as the provision of access to nutrition, clean water and sanitation, as well as contributing to the reduction and handling of stunting prevalence in Kupang Regency, which previously in 2020 was at 22.3 percent to 12 percent in 2024. The availability of clean water and sanitation can reduce the risk of infection such as repeated diarrhea which can inhibit nutrition absorption and cause stunting.

In an effort to improve this clean water access facility, Danone Indonesia has built clean water facilities in five villages in Kupang and Southwest Sumba Regencies, of which two were inaugurated today by Danone Indonesia to the beneficiary community, witnessed by the Special Envoy for the Secretary General of the United Nations (UN) for Water, the Head of the Permanent UN Representative in Indonesia, the Governor of NTT Province and the Regent of Kupang.

Realizing the limited resources of the community to process clean water into safe drinking water, Danone Indonesia also collaborated with NAZAVA to distribute a total of 1,500 safe drinking water filters (water filters) to various regions in NTT.

Partnering with MPM Muhammadiyah and the Community Care Network Foundation (JPM), Danone Indonesia handed over 500 units directly to the people in Kupang Regency and TTS; and developed an ecosystem for subsidized water filter marketing which was allocated 1,000 units in the early stages, by cooperating with the Mitra Dhuafa Cooperative (KOMIDA) through a credit mechanism.",https://imgsrv2.voi.id/Oe7kEWq23hMCTWC2ujTzo-9g5cUTZ25KJxiR_H2yJrY/rs:fill/w:800/h:450/g:sm/wm:1:nowe:0:0:1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy80OTU0NTgvMjAyNTA3MTUxNjM4LW1haW4uY3JvcHBlZF8xNzUyNTcyMzQ3LkpQRw.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 07:04:32.841662

“As a robotic surgeon, we want LigaSure™ technology because it gives us confidence in the security of the seal.
The Medtronic Hugo™ RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies.
In the EU, the Hugo™ RAS system is CE marked.
In the U.S., the Hugo™ RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.","Medtronic plc, a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced it has received CE Mark for the LigaSure™ RAS vessel-sealing technology, expanding Hugo™ robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system capabilities for gynecologic, general, and urologic procedures in Europe.

As the first-ever robotic-driven LigaSure™ instrument, this milestone represents the beginning of a new era for the vessel-sealing technology that has been used in more than 35 million procedures across 65+ countries over the last two decades.

“Today, with CE Mark for LigaSure™ RAS, Medtronic is fulfilling a promise to customers to integrate our trusted vessel-sealing technology onto the Hugo™ RAS system,” said Matt Anderson, senior vice president and president of the Surgical business, which is part of the Medical Surgical Portfolio at Medtronic. “More than fulfilling a commitment, this regulatory approval is a big step forward as we continue to shape the future of surgery with surgical teams who share our passion and commitment to deliver the best possible care to every patient.”

Dr. Miguel Caceres of Pacifica Salud Hospital in Panama was one of the first surgeons in the world to use LigaSure™ RAS with the Hugo™ RAS system.

“LigaSure™ technology is one of the most important advances for minimally invasive surgery because it provides sealing and cutting in a way that is very, very secure for the performance of the surgeon and the security of the patient,” said Dr. Caceres. “As a robotic surgeon, we want LigaSure™ technology because it gives us confidence in the security of the seal. We are already seeing the benefits in our cases with the Hugo™ RAS system.”

Powered by the Valleylab™ FT10 energy platform and for use exclusively with the Hugo™ RAS system, the LigaSure™ RAS Maryland instrument is indicated for sealing and cutting vessels, thick tissue, and lymphatics up to and including 7 mm in diameter. The device reliably seals vessels in approximately 2 seconds while minimizing thermal spread to surrounding tissue.

This week at SRS: LigaSure™ RAS initial experience, Hugo™ GYN data and telesurgery demo

Dr. Caceres, who has been using the Hugo™ RAS system four years, will discuss his initial experience with LigaSure™ RAS during a Medtronic-sponsored symposium at the Society of Robotic Surgery (SRS) 2025 Annual Meeting, July 16-20 in Strasbourg, France.

SRS also includes a presentation on preliminary outcomes of hysterectomy for benign gynecologic conditions — a Medtronic-sponsored study of 112 Hugo™ RAS procedures across eight sites in Europe and Asia. Dr. Francesco Fanfani, associate professor at Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic, will present the data.

Looking ahead to the next frontier of surgery, Medtronic will demo telesurgery capabilities on the Hugo™ RAS system from the nearby IRCAD facility — one of its strategic training partners. The demo will be followed by a panel discussion, including authors of Technical Guidelines for Remote Robotic-Assisted Surgery, which was recently published in the Journal of World Surgery.

The paper is a foundational piece to support safe and scalable telesurgery, reinforcing Medtronic’s commitment to innovation powered by human connection.

These announcements come amid growing momentum for the Hugo™ RAS system, which is now in use across 30+ countries on five continents, with over 270 independent publications supporting its clinical use across urology, gynecology, and general surgery procedures.

In the U.S., the company’s submission for a urology indication is under review by the Food and Drug Administration, with an expected U.S. entrance later in the company’s current fiscal year, followed by planned indication expansions into hernia and gynecology.

The Medtronic Hugo™ RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies. Regulatory requirements of individual countries and regions will determine approval, clearance, or market availability. In the EU, the Hugo™ RAS system is CE marked. In the U.S., the Hugo™ RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.

This strategic move aims to streamline operations and focus investments on higher-margin products. The company, valued at approximately $32 billion, is grappling with evolving consumer preferences, particularly the growing demand for healthier food options, while facing financial pressures from inflation and shifting shopping habits.

In an effort to adapt to these market dynamics, Kraft Heinz introduced a zero-salt-and-sugar ketchup. However, despite such innovations, the company is experiencing declining sales and stiffening competition. Recent financial results reflect this trend, with two consecutive years of revenue decline and a revised future outlook.

Kraft Heinz’s ongoing restructuring efforts include the divestment of its Italian baby food business, which was sold to New Princes for €120 million. These moves are part of a broader strategy to reinvest in the company’s core areas, positioning itself for long-term growth and value creation. The split, expected to be formalised soon, is seen as a potential means of unlocking greater shareholder value.

Locals have mixed feelings on the new store - with many hoping it will cut congestion at other stores but also fearing it could bring a rise in traffic.

The megastore, which is coming to Richland, Washington State, by August, has yet to settle on an opening date.

However, parts of the parking lot and the building's exterior are already complete, according to KEPRTV.

But as its grand opening edges closer, some residents have been expressing their concerns, with one telling reporters: ""I think it's good but it's just going to bring a lot of traffic.”

And another added: ""Well, I'm excited for the Costco here but I am nervous about the traffic here.

""I mean, traffic along Queensgate's already bad enough, you know, so like, I can imagine that Costco is just going to make it worse.""

A resident from West Richland had a more positive opinion, saying: ""I live in West Richland and I've often felt like we were on the edge of civilization a little bit so it's pretty exciting to me to have the Costco gas station right here.""

The report added that the city of Richland has begun infrastructure improvements on some roads nearby in anticipation of the store’s opening.

Recent stats revealed there are 630 Costco stores in the US, including Puerto Rico, with 143 of those in California.

TOTAL RECALL

This comes as, earlier this month, Costco shoppers were warned of two kinds of tires - the Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C and the Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires Size 235/40R19 - had been recalled over safety issues.

Michelin issued a recall notice for the Agilis CrossClimate C-metric tires because the size did not comply with regulatory requirements and posed a greater risk of a crash.

""Chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block,"" the recall stated.

The recall also noted that tire identification information is usually written on the side of each tire, directly above the bead.

Drivers who believe they purchased the recalled product were urged to double-check if they possess the faulty tires.

Those who bought the Michelin tires were asked to visit their local Michelin retailer, who would remove and replace the product with an equivalent tire.

Drivers will not be charged for the service.

“In the second quarter of 2025, enterprise demand outpaced consumer demand, underpinned by Windows 11 migrations and pandemic-era desktop renewals, while consumer refreshes slowed as buyers deferred purchases,” says Rishi Padhi, research principal at Gartner. “PC shipments are forecast to rise 2.4% in 2025, propelled by a tariff-driven front-loaded inventory surge in the first half of 2025 in the US, and ongoing Windows 11 replacement cycles in the rest of the world. In the second half of 2025, shipment growth is expected to plateau as vendors draw down stock in response to demand, potentially creating excess inventory by year-end.

“Meanwhile, the EMEA PC market grew 5,3% year-over-year. This illustrates signs of a modest recovery and stronger-than-usual seasonal demand. The Windows 11 refresh cycle remains a key driver, particularly for desktop replacements.

“However, the expected surge in new device purchases has been subdued, as many organizations opt to update existing PCs to Windows 11 rather than invest in new hardware.”

There were no major changes in the top five vendor rankings worldwide in the second quarter of 2025. Lenovo saw the strongest growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13,9% year-over-year.

Owner and operator Jerry Tonelli announced the San Francisco store would be shuttering following his retirement.

The store has outlasted pharmacy empires like Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid, along with various mail order services.

While the closure has come as a shock to some customers, Jerry assured them that it was his decision to close the store and that he was leaving on his own terms.

'It is time for all of us to start a new phase in our lives and spend more time with our families,' he wrote in a Facebook post.

The longtime store has been in the same building since 1918 and was purchased by the Tonelli family in 1965.

Jerry took over the store in 1978 following the death of his father and has worked with family members like his brother, Paul, who also owns a share of the business.

With other relatives uninterested in taking over the business, Jerry began measures to close up, including thanking loyal customers and patients.

The Tonelli family's pharmaceutical run began when Dino Tonelli, Jerry's father, began working at the store in 1949.

The late employee had graduated from a pharmacy school at UCSF and served in World War II before taking over the business, but not before meeting his wife.

'My mother started working here when she was 16, and she died in 2023 at the age of 96,' Jerry told CBS News.

'So, she had quite a run here, and this was her favorite part of the store because she used to do all the buying for the cosmetics, for the perfumes.'

His parents teamed up in keeping the business strong before Dino's death, leaving Jerry to learn by 'trial and error' in his thirties.

The soon-to-be-retiree managed to keep the business going and made new friends along the way that were grateful for his help.

'We get a lot of people from other countries that don't have health insurance and don't want to see a doctor,' he revealed.

'They'll come in and ask this and ask that and try to treat them with over-the-counter medication to help them out.'

Many customers have shared memories and stories of how Central Drug Store has helped them in some way while growing up.

'As a young girl in the 50s my mom, Tosca Chiantelli and I came in your store every Saturday and looked at everything in the displays and picked up prescriptions and necessities,' a Facebook user wrote.

The customer continued by saying she visited the pharmacy regularly in the 70s and 80s, and how happy she was about the pharmacy continuing to help her parents for decades.

'I used to love going into the drugstore with my mom as a little girl. Silvana was always my favorite at the make up counter,' another social media user commented.

Longtime customer Fran Colombo has been going to the store for the last 50 years explained the family would make everyone feel special as soon as they walk in the door.

She was also touched by Jerry escorting her husband to his car, saying his action went 'above and beyond.'

Now that the store is shuttering, Colombo is trying to figure out what to do next, and is questioning what other customers will do.

'I'm kind of computer savvy, but what about the people who aren't, who are just used to the walking in and calling in a prescription and walking in and picking it up? What are they going to do?,' she asked.

Jerry admitted that one of his biggest concerns was independent pharmacies being forced out by various pharmaceutical empires.

However, some of those companies have been struggling in recent years.

Rite Aid, a once-popular chain with over 5,000 stores, filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and again in May this year. It is now planning to shutter all its stores.

The status of CVS has also been concerning since the chain planned to close 900 stores by the end of 2024.

Currently operating over 9,000 US locations, CVS is also set to shutter hundreds of stores this year.

If that wasn't enough, Walgreens has been in the process of shuttering 1,200 stores, including 450 this year.

While the pharmaceutical crisis continues to be on the rise, Jerry will be busy golfing, spending time with family, and continuing to help people by volunteering at hospitals or shelters.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/14/20/100302991-0-image-m-79_1752521851608.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 09:03:17.360466

Kennedy has targeted the use of artificial dyes in the nation’s food since taking the lead at HHS.
Companies, including Kraft Heinz and Nestle, pledged earlier this year to remove artificial dyes from their products.
“Today’s announcement represents a commitment by dozens of individual ice cream companies,” Jacobs said.
The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.","(WHTM) – Dozens of ice cream manufacturers in the United States have pledged to eliminate artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.

On Monday, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) joined Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other national health leaders to announce the commitment to remove artificial colors.

Specifically, the IDFA said the companies that produce more than 90 percent of ice cream sold in the U.S. — or about 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts — will remove Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 from their ice cream and frozen dairy desserts.

The commitment applies to products made with real milk sold at food retail locations, not products made with non-dairy ingredients and those made in-house at local businesses.

Kennedy has targeted the use of artificial dyes in the nation’s food since taking the lead at HHS. Companies, including Kraft Heinz and Nestle, pledged earlier this year to remove artificial dyes from their products.

In place of artificial colors, manufacturers should use ones made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.

“I applaud the International Dairy Foods Association for stepping up to eliminate certified artificial colors,” Kennedy said. “The American people have made it clear—they want real food, without chemicals. Together, we will Make America Healthy Again.”

Andy Jacobs, chair of the IDFA Ice Cream Board and CEO of Turkey Hill Dairy, Inc., based in Conestoga, Pa., joined Kennedy during the announcement on Monday.

“Today’s announcement represents a commitment by dozens of individual ice cream companies,” Jacobs said. “From small independent companies to family-owned businesses going back generations, to large multi-national companies—we have all come together in a true industry-wide effort to make these changes.”

A full list of companies participating in the initiative was not provided. A spokesperson for the IDFA said the announcement on Monday “fulfills our role as representatives of the fully dairy supply chain, including ice cream makers.’

Nexstar’s WTHM has reached out to HHS for a list of companies that have committed to the plan.

The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.

Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that “most children have no adverse effects” when consuming foods made with them.

The national focus on artificial food dyes is “a good step to take,” but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.

“Just taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,” she said. “It still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.”

However, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called “a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.”

Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that “encourages” them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.

Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won’t guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.

“Talk is cheap,” Galligan said. “It’s easy for companies to make promises to look like they’re being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.”

New legislation from the New York City Council will force third-party apps to pay grocery delivery workers $21.44 to match the increase other food delivery workers got in April.

Nearly 20,000 grocery delivery workers will see a pay increase. Companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub have come under fire in recent years over worker conditions, and bills passed in 2021 created a base minimum pay.

New York City Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez said, ""I am happy to help move this city forward and make sure all delivery workers are treated fairly, no matter what app they're on,"" she told the press after the bill was passed.

""Right now, grocery and goods delivery workers are left out of the protections food delivery workers already have. This bill closes that gap. It doesn't take anything away-it just says: if you're doing the same work, you deserve the same protections,"" Gutiérrez continued.

On the other hand, Instacart strongly came out against the law. ""It is simply unconscionable that the City Council is considering a bill that would jeopardize a lifeline thousands of New Yorkers rely on,"" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.

Nurse, a former delivery worker herself, added, ""These workers, many of whom come from immigrant communities, are being paid poverty wages simply because they deliver items, and sometimes even the same item, on a different app. This two-tiered wage system inhibits our goal to make NYC more affordable and livable, and as these sectors grow we refuse to leave these immigrant workers behind.""

""These are multi-million dollar companies making a lot of money by having a lot of workers they don't have any obligations to, but we also have power here. It is an obligation of local government to study this industry, monitor it and take action, and that's what we're doing,"" Nurse went on.

Located in the Bandra-Kurla Complex, an upscale business center in the financial capital Mumbai, the showroom will serve as Tesla’s flagship retail and experience outlet as the company introduces its EV lineup to Indian customers.

Tesla’s entry to India comes after years of delays and policy friction, marking a pivotal expansion in a fast-growing consumer base while global sales are plunging and the company faces challenges in its two core markets, China and the U.S.

Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply from April to June as boycotts over Elon Musk’s political views continued keeping buyers away.

For India, Tesla’s entry signals rising investor confidence and strengthens its move towards clean mobility.

The country’s nascent electric vehicle market made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.

Tesla will begin by importing and selling its popular Y model cars in India. The base price would be 6.78 million rupees ($79,089) for the long-range, rear-wheel drive vehicle, according to a presentation by the company during the showroom launch Tuesday.

By comparison, the price tag is around $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit.

The rear-wheel drive will sell for around 6 million rupees ($70,000) in India. Delivery is expected to start from the third quarter, Tesla officials said.

Tesla's higher pricing is likely to make its cars unaffordable for most Indians .

Tesla will compete mostly with German luxury carmakers such as BMW and Mercedes Benz Group AG, and not budget Indian players like Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. The luxury car market makes up just about 1% of total vehicle sales

The debut by American EV giant, however, would bring in world class technology to the country, auto analyst Gaurav Vangaal said.

“With deeper local investments, Tesla can accelerate India’s EV ecosystem, drive innovation and support the government’s goal of higher EV penetration,” said Vangaal, an associate director with S & P Global Mobility.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has wooed Tesla for years for its global brand value and to boost the country’s clean energy endeavors.

CEO Elon Musk invited Indians in April 2016 to preorder the upcoming Tesla Model 3. Several customers placed an order but the cars never arrived and the booking amount had to be refunded.

Despite his earlier enthusiasm, in 2019 Musk expressed concern in a post on his social media platform X that import taxes could double prices of Tesla cars, making them “unaffordable.”

Tesla pressed Indian authorities to cut import taxes on EVs, which were up to 100%, to be able to test the local market. New Delhi, however, wanted Tesla to set up manufacturing facilities so a comprehensive policy could benefit all the players in the sector.

The dynamics changed after Modi and Musk met in the U.S. in February during a state visit by Modi.

Barely a month later, India rolled out a new policy to woo the likes of Tesla, reducing import taxes to 15% from 70% to 100% for EVs priced cheaper than $35,000 as long the automaker committed to building a factory in the country within three years.

Soon after, Musk announced he would visit India in April to meet Modi. It was widely expected he would unveil Tesla’s plans to set up manufacturing facilities and commit billions of dollars in investments. But Musk cancelled the visit, citing “very heavy Tesla obligations,” and travelled to China instead.

Since then, Tesla has conveyed it does not have an immediate interest in manufacturing in India.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said it would be “unfair” to the U.S. if Tesla builds a factory in India to circumvent that country’s tariffs. India and the U.S. are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement for greater market access and reducing tariffs on most goods, including automobiles.

Besides bringing Tesla to India, Musk’s India ambition has been to launch Starlink’s commercial internet services. The plan got a boost recently after the company secured regulatory clearances.

Starlink now needs to secure telecommunications airwaves from the government, which may take at least a couple of months, before the services are formally launched.

GenAI for preventing dementia, other age-related diseases

South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Korea Health Industry Development Institute are seeking organisations that will lead its seven new projects under the Korean Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).

Two projects will develop foundational AI models for assessing cognitive decline and ageing risks.

Another project will also develop AI for addressing hospital-acquired infections. Meanwhile, a project will utilise quantum computing in discovering new drug candidates as part of novel drug development.

In May, three Korean ARPA-H projects were announced, which include the development of an AI-powered assistant robot for surgeries.

The Korean government has set aside a total of 1.2 trillion won ($830 million) through 2032 for the program.

Hong Kong study first to use AI to predict individual tooth decay

Dentistry researchers from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have developed what could be the world's first AI system for predicting individual tooth risk of dental cavities in children based on microbial characteristics.

The AI system called Spatial-MiC was developed based on the research team's findings of distinct microbial patterns that predict tooth decay from tracking over 2,500 individual tooth plaque samples of 89 children aged 3-5.

In their study, which findings have been published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, the AI system demonstrated 98% accuracy in detecting existing cavities and 93% accuracy in predicting cavities two months before they became clinically apparent.

According to HKU, these findings may pave the way for precision dentistry that provides targeted preventive care to high-risk teeth.

""We've moved from seeing cavities as inevitable to being able to predict and prevent them at the microbial level, tooth by tooth,"" stressed Shi Huang, study lead and assistant professor of Microbiology at the HKU Faculty of Dentistry.

For its part, SmartCare will provide its AI-powered solutions, including a consultation platform, while CUHKMC will facilitate access to its AI lab for the development and integration of SmartCare's solutions.

""By integrating AI into our clinical practices, we aim to enhance clinical efficiency and provide a more personalised and efficient healthcare experience for our patients,"" said CUHKMC CEO Dr Fung Hong in a statement.

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Walmart, Target as well as Best Buy have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass on.

Amazon.com extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration’s volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

According to the report, shopping on mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving 53.2 percent of online sales, above Adobe’s forecast of 52.5 percent.

According to Adobe, overall discounts across U.S. retailers were between 11 percent and 24 percent, compared with the prior forecast range of 10 percent to 24 percent.

Apparel had the biggest deals at 24 percent, compared with 20 percent last year, while electronics were at 23 percent, similar to last year.

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June.
Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”","The latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global has shown how uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June. According to the data, permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

At the same time, the overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring,” noted Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, “But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering – which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said: “There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery,” Carberry went on: “The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”",https://www.theglobalrecruiter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1102351094-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 04:58:45.621011

The company has revised its net revenue growth forecast for FY25, projecting a rise of 1-2% compared to the earlier prediction of a 1-2% decline.

Projected Organic Revenue Growth

The expected organic growth in revenue has also been adjusted. Levi Strauss & Co. now projects an increase of 4.5-5.5%, a significant improvement from the earlier estimate of 3.5-4.5%. These expectations are centered on the company’s continuing operations, excluding the Dockers business, which was divested earlier in May.

The company’s forecasts take into consideration the current tariff rates. It anticipates that the US tariffs on imports from China will persist at 30%, and the remaining global tariffs will remain at 10% for the rest of the year.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer of Levi Strauss & Co., expressed confidence in the company’s future, asserting, “We are fundamentally evolving into a higher growth, higher margin organization, with enhanced cash flows and returns on invested capital.”

Second Quarter Performance

The second quarter, which concluded on June 1, was a strong one for Levi Strauss & Co. The company achieved a 6% increase in net revenues on a reported basis and a 9% increase on an organic basis, culminating in a total revenue of US$1.4 billion.

Regionally, organic sales rose 9% in the Americas and 15% in Europe. However, sales remained stagnant in Asia. Net income from continuing operations also witnessed a remarkable increase, rising from $17 million in the previous year to $80 million.

Looking Ahead

The company’s President and CEO, Michelle Gass, expressed optimism about the company’s future. She stated that Levi Strauss & Co. is entering the second half of 2025 with a strong foundation. The company continues to strive towards becoming a leading denim lifestyle brand and a top direct-to-consumer retailer. Gass is confident that Levi’s future is brighter and its legacy larger, and the company is steadily building towards this vision quarter by quarter.

The group, which aggregates demand from its members, will spend $1.7 million to buy credits from U.S.-firm Karbonetiq, Italy-based Limenet and Canadian firm pHathom.

By contracting to buy early, the firms are better able to hire, raise finance and get the technologies off the ground, said Hannah Bebbington, head of deployment at Frontier.

“It allows companies to demonstrate commercial viability,” she said.

Frontier’s support for these early stage firms, which aim to lock emissions away in the ocean or in rocks and industrial waste, marks its fifth series of commitments.

Frontier, which was set up in 2022, aims to invest at least $1 billion in carbon removal credits between 2022 and 2030. It has already committed $600 million, some on the series of pre-purchases and the bulk on a series of off-take agreements with larger firms. Last week, it agreed to pay $41 million for 116,000 tons from waste biomass firm Arbor.

For oceans, the aim is to increase the alkalinity of the water, helping it to lock away more carbon emissions. This is often done by adding “quicklime”, made from limestone.

For the mineralization technologies, meanwhile, projects attempt to speed up the process whereby rocks and industrial waste naturally absorb carbon dioxide, for example by crushing up the material to create a larger surface area.

Bebbington said both technologies had the potential to be impactful because they could be scaled quickly and cheaply.

With clean energy usage becoming increasingly imperative for many businesses due to the savings on power bills and meeting their sustainability objectives, rooftop solar is a preferred choice for going green.

Mumbai-based HP Adhesives, a company specializing in adhesives and sealants, has recently installed a 392.7 kW rooftop solar system at its manufacturing facility in Narangi Village in Maharashtra’s Raigad district.

Energy from the rooftop solar installation accounts for 65-70% of the company’s total electricity consumption. The system generates 540,750 kWh of power annually.

The installation comprises 714 high-efficiency bifacial modules supplied by RenewSys and three 100 kW inverters from Growatt New Energy.

HP Adhesives’ decision to adopt solar energy was driven by high electricity costs and its commitment to sustainability.

Mihir Shah, Chief Financial Officer at HP Adhesives, stated, “We have been able to reduce almost 60% to 65% of the electricity bills monthly by installing rooftop solar. We are also planning to expand our installations at the premises in the future.”

In its annual report 2023-24, the company had said that it was in the process of installing solar panels at its manufacturing plant. “We recognize the importance of environmentally responsible practices and strive to minimize our carbon footprint through sustainable manufacturing processes,” it said in the report.

Pune-based Kalpa Power, which executed and commissioned the project for HP Adhesives, said scheduling the reinforced cement concrete work while monitoring weather conditions during the monsoon was the primary challenge; however, the installation was completed without delay.

Shrikant Soni, Deputy General Manager at Kalpa Power, said, “We offer five-year operations and maintenance services for the project, which include periodic cleaning, plant monitoring through a supervisory control and data acquisition system, and monthly generation reports. These services are renewable after the initial five-year period.” The company also offers performance guarantees with a guaranteed performance ratio and component warranties.

At a recent C&I Clean Energy Meet hosted by Mercom India in Mumbai, industry experts shared insights on how C&I businesses can save on power bills by switching to solar and choosing between open-access and rooftop solar solutions.

Mercom India has been organizing a series of C&I Clean Energy Meets which are designed to provide C&I energy buyers with the knowledge and tools they need to adopt clean energy solutions and lower their power costs.

While stablecoins offer features like fast transactions, low fees, and round-the-clock availability, Mastercard believes these are not enough to make them viable for everyday payments.

According to Bloomberg, Chief Product Officer Jorn Lambert said stablecoins still lack the essential elements that drive consumer adoption, such as a smooth user experience, broad distribution and ease of use.

Since at least 2021, Mastercard has been building out partnerships and infrastructure to support stablecoin transactions.

These efforts include a collaboration with Paxos to support the minting and redemption of the USDG stablecoin, and ongoing support for tokens like USDC from Circle, PYUSD from PayPal, and FIUSD from Fiserv.

Despite these developments, Lambert pointed out that around 90 percent of stablecoin usage is still concentrated in cryptocurrency trading.

Some platforms like Shopify and Coinbase have started enabling stablecoin payments for consumers, but uptake remains limited due to friction at checkout and unclear benefits compared to traditional payment methods.

Stablecoins were initially promoted as a way to bypass card networks and lower transaction costs.

However, companies like Mastercard are now reframing their role, positioning themselves as infrastructure providers that can help stablecoins scale securely through integration with existing financial systems.

Raj Seshadri, Mastercard’s Chief Commercial Payments Officer, noted that the real cost of using stablecoins goes beyond the token itself.

It includes conversion to and from fiat currency, compliance requirements, and settlement processes, all of which add layers of complexity to what should be a seamless transaction.

Beyond the private sector, central banks and financial regulators are also paying close attention to stablecoins.

Lambert said banks are weighing whether to issue their own stablecoins or deposit tokens to maintain control over customer funds.

At the same time, governments are looking to promote domestic digital currency innovation to avoid increased dependence on foreign currencies.",https://fintechnews.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mastercard-Stablecoins-Not-Yet-Ready-for-Everyday-Payment-Use.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 03:58:33.880438

He succeeds Aseem Kaushik, who will take over as Chairman of L’Oréal India, signalling the company’s renewed focus on long-term growth and market leadership in India.

The move is seen as a pivotal shift as the beauty giant aims to double its business in India and significantly expand its local production, according to global CEO Nicolas Hieronimus. The country currently produces half a billion units annually—a figure L’Oréal aims to more than double in the coming years.

Lebel currently heads L’Oréal’s Consumer Products Division in Mexico, where he led the business through a phase of accelerated growth. A seasoned global executive, he brings with him two decades of experience across Procter & Gamble and AB InBev in Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa. His appointment is expected to inject global insight into the company’s local strategy as L’Oréal India seeks to scale aggressively in a dynamic and competitive beauty landscape.

Aseem Kaushik, who has been with L’Oréal India since the 1990s, is credited with establishing major consumer brands like Garnier and Maybelline in the country. As Chairman, he will now focus on enhancing corporate reputation, managing public affairs, and deepening stakeholder engagement and CSR initiatives. His elevation underscores the company’s commitment to anchoring local leadership while embracing global expertise.

The leadership reshuffle comes at a time when L’Oréal India is charting an ambitious growth path. Group CEO Nicolas Hieronimus recently stated that the company plans to more than double its India business and production capacity in the coming years. Currently producing around 500 million units annually, L’Oréal aims to significantly expand its manufacturing footprint, particularly with growing export potential to Gulf countries.

According to reports, L’Oréal India posted ₹5,685 crore in sales in FY25, marking a 14% growth year-on-year. However, profits remained flat at ₹488 crore, largely due to intensifying competition from digital-first, D2C, and regional beauty brands. The company now plans to strengthen its presence across both mass and premium segments, with a portfolio that includes L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline, Garnier, NYX, Kiehl’s, Lancôme, and Yves Saint Laurent.

With a robust local presence through factories in Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh, and R&D centers in Mumbai and Bengaluru, L’Oréal India produces nearly 95% of the products it sells domestically. It also continues to invest in innovation and startup partnerships, including recent investments in Indian beauty startups Deconstruct and Arata.

As India’s beauty and personal care market races towards an estimated $34 billion by 2028, L’Oréal’s leadership transition signals its intent to remain at the forefront of transformation, combining local agility with global vision.",https://erp.adgully.com/artical_image/08c974ba3569e884104f2280bfd3543b.jpeg,N,,2025-07-15 07:04:19.783438

A spokesperson for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.
In 2019, when Kraft Heinz wrote down $15.4 billion for some well-known brands, this CEO of Berkshire stated that the company overpaid when acquiring Kraft.
Its investment in The Kraft Heinz common stock also brought in over $6 billion in dividend income.
In recent years, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has gradually reduced its shareholding in The Kraft Heinz.","According to the Zhiyin Finance APP, in 2015, Warren Buffett supported the establishment of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC.US) and publicly claimed it was an opportunity to ""bring iconic brands together.” However, ten years later, the company plans to divest many of its brands, which is considered a rare setback for the renowned investor.

Since Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and private equity firm 3G Capital teamed up to merge these two consumer goods companies, Kraft Heinz's stock price has dropped more than 60%, while the overall stock market has significantly risen during the same period. Berkshire’s approximately 27% shareholding has decreased in market cap by about $4.5 billion, and leaving the market now would further widen the loss.

For the 94-year-old Buffett, this deal represents one of the rare missteps in his career. He will step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. at the end of this year, closing a 60-year professional life during which he has profited handsomely from investments in many well-known brands. Although stable dividend income and the profits gained from acquiring Heinz in the two years prior to the merger with Kraft keep Berkshire overall in a profit state, had this common stock investment instead been directed toward the overall stock market, the group could have made nearly $10 billion more.

Matthew Palazzola, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg Industry Research, said: ""Perhaps he didn’t anticipate that the market would shift towards healthier options. Kraft Heinz holds a significant position in processed foods, and Buffett’s own dietary habits have never been particularly healthy, which perhaps made it difficult for him to foresee this trend."" A spokesperson for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.

Kraft Heinz owns many well-known brands such as Oscar Mayer and Kraft Mac & Cheese but has been impacted in recent years by inflation and declining demand for packaged foods, in part driven by the prevalence of weight loss drugs. According to previous reports, the company is currently considering a business split, separating a significant portion of its operations into a new entity.

Buffett has long admitted that the investment in Kraft was not the best choice. In 2019, when Kraft Heinz wrote down $15.4 billion for some well-known brands, this CEO of Berkshire stated that the company overpaid when acquiring Kraft.

However, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. earned billions through the dividends from the preferred shares of Heinz and the redemption of those shares in 2016, thereby achieving profitability. Its investment in The Kraft Heinz common stock also brought in over $6 billion in dividend income.

In recent years, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has gradually reduced its shareholding in The Kraft Heinz. Earlier this year, The Kraft Heinz stated that two board members associated with Berkshire would resign, and indicated that this was not due to disagreements with management or the Board of Directors regarding the company's operation, policies, or practices.

Currently, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. still holds a large number of shares in the company. If a spin-off could boost the returns of this food enterprise, Buffett may gain more benefits. Before news of the spin-off emerged, The Kraft Heinz's stock price had already risen nearly 5% by Thursday's close.

CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert stated: ""The spin-off will improve the performance of this investment. Frankly, its prior performance has not been ideal.""",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022050900000138b797f787435.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 03:58:50.662410

The airport has lined up a contractor to conduct demolition of Concourse E, which has been shuttered since 2017. In its place, the airport will build a new International Terminal capable of handling more passengers and more flights than the existing facility.

HM Brandt, a demolition contractor based in Lannon, Wisconsin, has applied for a permit with the City of Milwaukee for demolition of the concourse. Construction is not imminent, though.

The airport is still putting together all the financing needed for the $92.5 million terminal, according to a spokesperson for the airport.

The airport has $55 million previously appropriated in 2019 by the county. Last year, the federal government awarded the airport an $8.5 million grant through the Airport Terminal Program ATP. The competitive grant program was created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by Congress under President Joe Biden. It appropriated $5 billion to upgrade airport infrastructure across the country. The airport is going after another ATP grant for the upcoming fiscal year.

Planning began in 2015. The existing international terminal, built in 1975, is considered undersized for modern aircraft. The planes used on long international flights, like the Boeing 767 and 787 aircraft, have greater passenger capacity than the terminal, which could only fit approximately 140 people at a time.

For investors, the case is clear: Levi's structural advantages—high-margin DTC dominance, resilient brand power, and disciplined capital allocation—warrant an overweight position.","The apparel industry is undergoing a seismic shift. As consumers increasingly demand authenticity, sustainability, and direct engagement with brands, traditional wholesale models are being supplanted by a focus on Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) dominance. Few companies exemplify this transformation better than Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE: LEVI), which has now recorded 13 consecutive quarters of DTC revenue growth, while simultaneously expanding margins to historic highs. This structural pivot isn't just a temporary boost—it's the foundation of a durable competitive advantage.

The DTC Revolution: Levi's Blueprint for Growth

Levi's Q2 2025 results underscore its evolution from a denim manufacturer to a lifestyle brand. DTC revenue now accounts for 50% of total sales, growing 11% year-over-year, while its DTC EBIT margins surged by 400 basis points to become a profit engine. This shift is no accident:

Channel Optimization: By prioritizing high-margin DTC channels (e.g., owned stores, e-commerce), Levi reduced reliance on wholesale partners, which historically diluted margins and diluted brand control.

Brand Equity: Unaided brand awareness has risen sharply in key markets, fueled by cultural partnerships (e.g., collaborations with Beyoncé, Nike) and a focus on SKU rationalization. This has driven full-price sell-through, a critical metric for profitability.

Margin Expansion: From Survival to Thrival

Levi's margin story is as compelling as its top-line growth. Gross margin hit 62.6% in Q2, a record high, propelled by:

- Cost Discipline: Lower product costs and SKU simplification reduced inventory bloat.

- Tariff Mitigation: Despite punitive tariffs on Chinese imports, Levi's strategic supply chain diversification (e.g., shifting production to Vietnam, Mexico) limited margin erosion to just 20 basis points annually.

Adjusted EBIT margins expanded by 190 basis points to 8.3%, while SG&A expenses shrunk as a percentage of revenue. This margin resilience positions Levi to outperform peers in a high-interest-rate environment.

Strategic Moves to Outrun Macroeconomic Headwinds

Levi's leadership isn't just about cutting costs—it's about owning the future. Consider these moves:

1. Product Diversification: Women's apparel now accounts for 38% of sales (up from 19% in 2019), while tops and outerwear—non-traditional denim categories—are surging. This shift into higher-margin segments reduces reliance on commoditized jeans.

2. Asia Restructuring: While cutting ties with underperforming wholesale partners in India and Malaysia temporarily dampened growth, it's a long-term win. Management emphasized prioritizing profitability over volume in markets like China, where Levi is now doubling down on e-commerce.

3. Inventory Prudence: A 15% year-over-year inventory jump may raise short-term concerns, but it's a calculated hedge against supply chain disruptions and holiday demand.

Why Levi's Resilience Justifies an Overweight Position

Critics might argue that Levi's stock (currently trading at $26.50) already reflects its success. But three factors suggest further upside:

1. Structural Tailwinds: The apparel industry's shift to DTC is irreversible. Levi's 13-quarter streak proves its model works.

- Historical context confirms that when Levi beats earnings expectations, its stock has shown a 36.36% 3-day win rate and 27.27% 30-day win rate, underscoring short-term momentum while reinforcing its long-term structural advantages.

2. Margin Leverage: With $51 million returned to shareholders in Q2 (via dividends) and plans to repurchase shares using Dockers sale proceeds, Levi's capital allocation is shareholder-friendly.

3. Global Brand Momentum: Europe's 15% organic growth and Asia's DTC surge (despite regional headwinds) indicate Levi's is becoming a true global lifestyle brand.

Risks and Mitigants

Asia Uncertainty: Strategic exits in underperforming markets could delay near-term growth, but profitability is the priority.

Wholesale Caution: Management's conservative wholesale outlook reflects a focus on quality over quantity—a disciplined stance in uncertain times.

Final Take: Levi's is More Than a Jeans Maker—It's a Structural Play

Levi's transformation isn't just a story of margin expansion; it's a masterclass in redefining an industry. By leaning into DTC, brand equity, and product diversification, Levi has insulated itself from cyclical risks while positioning itself as a leader in a $3 trillion apparel market.

For investors, the case is clear: Levi's structural advantages—high-margin DTC dominance, resilient brand power, and disciplined capital allocation—warrant an overweight position. Even in a slowing economy, Levi's focus on full-price sales and cost control makes it a rare apparel stock capable of thriving.

Actionable Insight: Consider adding LEVI to portfolios with a 12-18 month horizon, targeting a price target of $32-$35 based on its updated EPS guidance and margin trajectory.

I’m a fundamental, valuation-driven investor with a strong focus on identifying businesses that have the potential to scale over time and unlock massive terminal value. My investment approach centers around understanding the core economics of a business—its competitive moat, unit economics, reinvestment runway, and management quality—and how those factors translate into long-term free cash flow generation and shareholder value creation. I focus on fundamental research, and I tend to focus on sectors with strong secular tailwinds. Professionally, I am a self-educated investor that started this journey 10 years ago. Currently, I am managing my own funds, seeded from friends and family. My motivation for writing on Seeking Alpha is to share investment insights, and also at the same garner feedback from fellow investors in this site.

Leaders from Starbucks, CVS Health, Walmart, Sam’s Club, Otis Elevator, LockNet and Step ‘n Wash are working with the American Association of People with Disabilities on a new effort dubbed The Access Coalition: Creating More Inclusive Retail Spaces.

Through the coalition, the companies say they will take steps to promote adoption of the Inclusive Spaces Framework, a set of accessibility guidelines developed by Starbucks that includes everything from optimized acoustics and lighting to power-operated doors, accessible equipment for employees and barrier-free pathways.

“The Access Coalition is a powerful example of the positive impact that can occur when industry comes together with community to co-create spaces that reflect and adapt to the range of consumer experiences,” said Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities.

Starbucks introduced the Inclusive Spaces Framework last year when it opened its first store designed to meet the new standards at Union Market in Washington, D.C. The company has committed to apply the framework at all newly built and renovated company-operated stores in the U.S.

“We’ve learned that this approach improves the experience for everyone, especially people with disabilities, and is also good for businesses,” said Dawn Clark, senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts at Starbucks.

Fellow members of The Access Coalition are now working toward piloting the design changes at their retail locations nationwide and they’re encouraging other companies to join them in enhancing accessibility.

“We recognize that advancing accessibility is a shared responsibility,” said Gayatri Agnew, senior director of global associate experience and head of the Accessibility Center of Excellence at Walmart and Sam’s Club. “By ensuring accessibility remains a core part of our design, building and operations, we’re not just removing barriers — we’re opening new opportunities.

The Q2 earnings will either validate its premium or expose it to a reckoning.","Boston Scientific (BSX) stands at a pivotal moment. With its July 23 earnings report looming, investors are betting on the medical device giant to deliver another quarter of robust growth—and justify its sky-high valuation. The company's Q1 2025 results, which saw revenue surge 20.9% year-over-year, were a masterclass in execution, but the question now is whether this momentum can sustain itself. Let's dissect the catalysts, risks, and valuation to determine if this is a buy, hold, or sell ahead of earnings.

The Earnings Catalysts: Where the Magic Happens

Boston Scientific's Q2 results will hinge on two critical pillars: the performance of its FARAPULSE™ PFA System and the integration of its recent acquisitions.

FARAPULSE™ Dominance:

In Q1, the FARAPULSE system drove a staggering 29.8% growth in Cardiology sales, outperforming rival Medtronic's Arctic Front device. Clinical trial data from the SINGLE SHOT CHAMPION trial showed superiority in treating atrial fibrillation, a condition affecting millions. Investors will scrutinize Q2's ELEVATE-PF trial results for the FARAFLEX™ PFA Catheter, which could further cement its leadership in this $2.6 billion ablation market.

Acquisition Synergy:

The $1.1 billion acquisition of SoniVie Ltd., which develops renal denervation technology for hypertension, and the Bolt Medical deal for lithotripsy innovations, are now in the integration phase. Management's ability to cross-sell these technologies into its existing cardiovascular and urology networks will be key.

Geographic Expansion:

The U.S. market delivered 31.1% revenue growth in Q1, but emerging markets like Asia-Pacific and Latin America, which grew 10.6% and 14.1% operationally, respectively, offer untapped potential. Success here could offset headwinds in Europe, where reimbursement delays have historically plagued the sector.

Valuation: A Premium Price for a Growth Story

Boston Scientific's valuation is unequivocally aggressive. Its trailing P/E of 76.13 is nearly double its sector peers' average, and its EV/EBITDA of 36.46 places it in rarified air. Yet, this premium is not without justification:

Growth Metrics:

The company's 17.6% revenue growth in 2024 and a raised 2025 guidance of 15-17% organic growth suggest it's outpacing the broader medical device industry, which faces regulatory and pricing headwinds.

Margin Expansion:

Despite heavy R&D spending ($1.5 billion annually), Boston Scientific has managed to keep EBITDA margins steady at 25.8%, a feat in a cost-conscious sector.

But risks loom large. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.52, while manageable, rises with its recent $1.5 billion debt issuance to fund acquisitions. Meanwhile, peers like Medtronic (MDT) trade at a P/E of 24.7x, and Abbott Labs (ABT) at 17.1x, underscoring the premium investors are paying for BSX's growth.

The Red Flags: Why Caution Remains

Margin Pressure:

With acquisitions and R&D spending, maintaining margins is critical. A single misstep—say, a delay in SoniVie's hypertension product—could crimp profitability.

Sector Headwinds:

The medical device sector's Zacks Industry Rank of 143/250 reflects broader challenges: slowing demand in Europe, Medicare's price caps, and competition from generics.

Valuation Sensitivity:

A Q2 miss—say, revenue below $4.85 billion or EPS below $0.71—could trigger a sharp correction. Technicals show the stock is already trading above its 50-day moving average of $90.39, leaving it vulnerable to profit-taking.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, or Wait for a Pullback?

The math here is stark: Boston Scientific's valuation demands flawless execution. If Q2 results beat estimates ($0.72 EPS, $4.89B revenue), the stock could rally toward its $117 price target (a 13% upside from current levels). Analysts at Citi and Truist have already raised targets, citing its “best-in-class” innovation pipeline.

History suggests that positive earnings surprises have been rewarding for investors. Over the past three years, when Boston Scientific exceeded earnings expectations, its stock demonstrated a 55.56% win rate over three days, rising to 77.78% over both 10 and 30 days, according to backtesting. This historical performance underscores the potential upside if Q2 results exceed expectations.

However, investors should prepare for volatility. The stock's RSI below 60 suggests it's not yet overbought, but a post-earnings drop could present a better entry point. Key triggers to watch:

- FARAPULSE's ELEVATE-PF trial data (due Q3).

- Growth in emerging markets, particularly in renal denervation and lithotripsy.

- Margin commentary from management, which could temper or fuel valuation multiples.

Final Call: A High-Risk, High-Reward Play

Boston Scientific is a speculative buy for investors willing to bet on its growth trajectory. The Q2 earnings will either validate its premium or expose it to a reckoning. For a 6–12 month horizon, the rewards outweigh the risks—if the company hits its targets.

Recommendation:

- Buy at $104.50, targeting $120 with a $95 stop-loss to manage downside.

- Hold if earnings miss, but watch for a pullback to $90 before considering entry.

In the end, Boston Scientific's story is as much about its ability to innovate as it is about executing on the mundane: margins, integration, and market share. July 23 will tell whether this gamble pays off.

The denim maker reported net revenues of $1.4 billion, up 6% from the same time last year. Net income for the quarter came in at $67 million, a significant jump from $18 million the same quarter last year.

On the back of a solid report, Levi’s raised its full-year revenue guidance, expecting sales to climb between 1% and 2%, an improvement from its former guidance of a 1% to 2% decline. It’s also significantly better than the downward 5.2% forecast by analysts, per LSEG.

But this is 2025, and before Levi’s CFO Harmit Singh shared the company’s guidance on an earnings call, he went out of his way to address tariffs, noting that Levi’s guidance “assumes an additional 30% tariff on goods arriving in the US from China and an additional 10% tariff on US imports from the rest of the world.”

While the retailer doesn’t share its primary manufacturing hubs, Singh told CNBC the majority of its supply comes from Southeast Asia, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, and Trump has recently threatened Bangladesh and Indonesia with higher tariffs.

With its current mitigation strategies in place, including supply chain diversification and vendor negotiations, the company expects tariffs to impact the business for the remainder of the year by 2 or 3 cents per share, or $25 to $30 million.

“We are doing our part. We are absorbing some of the costs. What helps is that our business is so strong,” Levi’s CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC. “We have been pulling back on promotions anyway, that’s leading to more full-price selling, and some of our new innovation, our new fits, we’re pricing at a premium, and they’re buying. So all of those things help us navigate this time of having the tariff headwind.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/b2782e2c034337c5dd273295d23cf1412f28eef1-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-15 03:59:04.935386

“Corporate liquidity has largely worsened in 2025 as debt levels for many companies have risen and the US Federal Reserve is poised to hold benchmark interest rates at their current level through the summer,” S&P said in the report. “Consumer spending, meanwhile, is straining under the weight of a cooling job market, inflation still above monetary policymakers’ targets and the Trump administration’s tariffs.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1355b0852de8e5387cb3814d63dbabfd43b20b20-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-14 23:59:58.656114

At the start of the year, Publicis Groupe globally merged the agency with Leo Burnett to create Leo, but in the local market, both Leo and the Queensland-based Publicis Worldwide will continue as brands.

Publicis Worldwide Australia ECD Ryan Petie told LBB a compliment from Publicis Groupe APAC CEO, Jane Lin-Baden, summed up the local operation’s strength; she “called us the little tiger of the group.”

“We have it really good because we have our own identity here in Australia, but we're powered by the biggest group in the world now. So it's basically the best of both worlds,” he said.

During an interview with Ryan, MD Simone Waugh, and CSO Simon Murphy during a visit to Sydney from their Brisbane base, the trio was clear they have no shortage of work. Queensland is in the middle of a boom that isn’t predicted to slow down any time soon, especially with Publicis named content partner for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic bid.

“For quite a number of years, Brisbane and Queensland have seen incremental growth, but this is unfair growth,” said Simone. “For the 2032 bid, we had to dive straight in and literally work hand in hand as a partner with the bid team, 24/7 for 30 days and 30 nights to get that bid together.”

Ryan added, “We created something like 30 different films in 30 days for the bid process, and one of them was the final film before the IOC [International Olympic Committee] jury had to press the green button or the red button. So probably the most stressful creative brief we've ever been given. And luckily, we're successful in the bid.”

As part of the bid, Queensland is aiming to make $44 billion in overnight visitor expenditure annually by 2032, which Simon described as “phenomenal statistical growth”. The agency will also be capitalising on that economic injection in its work with Tourism & Events Queensland.

“Momentum is huge in Queensland – it comes from tourism, it comes from immigration, it comes from talent that we can see …That has an impact on the business we're getting and the ambition of the clients that we're getting.”

In its 2025-26 state budget, the Queensland government forecast its economic growth will jump to 2.75% in 2025-26. The most recent Tourism Research Australia data estimates the state’s tourism sector is the second-largest in the country, making up 23.8% national tourism output.

With 2032 in sight, Simon pointed out a big part of the Publicis Worldwide story “started well before” the announcement of Brisbane’s Olympic win. The business is “well established to capitalise on the changes around us,” he said.

“Our story, our understanding of each other, our reflexes when it comes to developing the work is relatively well honed to continue that momentum.”

Ryan laughed, “We've always had that secret ambition – maybe not so secret – but we've always had the ambition for what the state of Queensland could become, and what we could become as an agency. Now it's actually getting fulfilled.

“We were never happy just to get 2% growth each year and a couple of local clients. We've always had this ambition to create world class creativity from Queensland, because it's the best place in the world.”

“Pull Versus Push”: Expanding Nationally

Outside of Queensland, Publicis Worldwide works with clients from all over the country. Simone attributed this to the fact that “we are absolute challengers.”

“We challenge each other. As a strategic and creative client team we will go deep into a business with the senior leaders of the business and find the real problem, challenge the problem, and then actually start looking at solutions.”

She added, “We're absolutely creative first, we believe in creativity as the multiplier effect. It's the one thing that's going to give businesses an unfair advantage going forward.

“Then we'll look at awards after that, we’ll say, ‘Okay, this, this is a good story, we should be putting that up in lights for our clients.’ We don't enter much, but what we do enter has a pretty good strike rate.”

There is a fine line between expanding and biting off more than you can chew. It’s something the team keeps in mind. Simone said the question the leaders ask is, “What is more risky?”

“If you go gung ho all at once, you are pushing yourselves into a market versus being demanded to service in a market. The approach that we're taking is pull versus push. It has to be our reputation and our work, and how we work is what attracts clients.”

Approaching Social Impact and Commercial Work The Same Way

As well as work on major accounts like Subway, Bulla, and Isuzu, Publicis Worldwide also has a large body of social impact and behaviour change work. The business has addressed domestic violence for Red Flags, youth cyberbullying for Convo2019, and vaping and road safety through the ‘Drink Driving UNPLYBL controller’ (pronounced Unplayable).

“Every other agency I've worked out in the past will have one pro bono client,” said Ryan. “We currently are facilitating more than that, because we believe in that balance of making sure people have good in their career.”

Simon has “never made a distinction” between social impact and commercial work.

“We're pretty good at benchmarking the best in the world just to challenge ourselves, and there's no shortage of learning,” he said.

“Because you approach it the same way. What's the human problem we're trying to solve? Can we get to the heart of that? It's just the way we get to it, whether it be engagement, or whether it be through more traditional ways of insight. It's another brief, and you do the best you can.”",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2025-07/publicis-leadership.8zM2GMku.png,N,,2025-07-14 20:59:25.704359

Starbucks is requiring some remote workers to return to its headquarters and increasing the number of days that corporate employees are required to work in an office.

In a letter to employees posted on Monday, Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said corporate employees would need to be in the office four days a week starting in early October instead of three days a week.

The Seattle-based company said that all corporate “people leaders” must be based in either Seattle or Toronto within 12 months. That is a change from February, when it required vice presidents to relocate to Seattle or Toronto.

Starbucks said individual employees working under those leaders would not be asked to relocate. But the company said all hiring for future roles and lateral moves will require employees to be based in Seattle or Toronto.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster,” Niccol wrote in the letter.

Niccol said affected workers who choose not to relocate will be eligible for a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment.

While many workers grew to enjoy working from home during the pandemic, the call for workers to return to offices full-time has been growing over the past year. Major employers such as Amazon, AT&T and the federal government have required employees to work in company sites five days per week. Competition for fully-remote jobs is fierce.

Starbucks spokeswoman Lori Torgerson said she didn’t have a count of employees who are currently working as “people leaders” or are working remotely. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, but that includes coffee roasters and warehouse staff.

Niccol was not required to relocate to Seattle when he was hired to lead Starbucks last August. Instead, the company said it would help him set up an office near his home in Newport Beach, California, and would give him the use of a corporate jet to commute to Seattle.

Since then, Niccol has bought a home in Seattle and is frequently seen at the company’s headquarters, Torgerson said.

The decision to pull the McPlant was made without a major public announcement. According to a statement from McDonald’s Austria, customer preferences have shifted more towards vegetable-based offerings, prompting the company to focus instead on a vegetarian patty made from vegetables.

Limited vegan options remain

As a result, options for vegan consumers will now be extremely limited, and essentially restricted to side items like French fries. The company also confirmed that no further fully vegan products are currently planned.

The McPlant, introduced in 2021 in collaboration with Beyond Meat, was considered a significant step towards expanding plant-based options in the fast-food sector. However, it only partially met vegan standards, as it was served with cheese and a dairy-based sauce. The recently introduced meat-free alternative featuring a vegetable patty is also not vegan.

Backlash from consumers

Additional background for the discontinuation of the McPlant may lie in the company’s partnership with Beyond Meat. Reports indicate that the collaboration contract has expired and was not renewed. The removal of the McPlant has sparked noticeable criticism on social media.

Ultium Cells, the joint venture between General Motors and South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution, plans to upgrade its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce multiple battery chemistries under one roof, including its newer, cheaper version.

The companies said July 14 that funding for the upgrades stems from a $2.3-billion investment first announced in 2021 and will allow Ultium to scale production of lithium iron phosphate battery cells, a lower-cost alternative to the nickel-rich batteries the companies also produce together.

Ultium Cells Spring Hill began production in April 2024 producing only nickel cobalt manganese aluminum batteries, which has allowed GM to produce vehicles capable of exceeding 300 miles of range on a charge. General Motors produces the gas-powered Cadillac XT5 the XT6 at its Spring Hill Assembly Plant, as well as the all-electric Cadillac Lyriq.

The other plant co-operated with General Motors in Warren, Ohio, will continue producing cells with nickel cobalt manganese aluminum chemistry, LG Energy Solution said.

“At GM, we’re innovating battery technology to deliver the best mix of range, performance and affordability to our EV customers,” Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, said in a statement. “This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio.”

Conversion of battery cell lines at Spring Hill to produce the new battery cells will begin later this year. LG Energy Solution said commercial production of the lithium iron phosphate batteries is expected by late 2027.

In addition to the two plants jointly operated with General Motors, LG Energy Solution has six other manufacturing facilities operating or under construction in the United States. LG Energy Solution also operates a Honda joint venture in Jeffersonville, Ohio, and a Hyundai Motor Co. facility in Savannah, Georgia.

LG Energy Solution plans to launch production of a new battery chemistry, called lithium manganese-rich batteries, in the U.S. by 2028 in partnership with General Motors. The company has not yet announced a production location for that type of battery.

Producing multiple battery types in the same facility allows GM the flexibility to better handle shifts in electric vehicle demand, producing the best option for its broad electric vehicle portfolio, according to Stephanie Brinley, associate director of Auto Intelligence at S&P Global Mobility.

“In concept, it’s not unlike putting the right engine under the right hood,” she said. “For the vehicle that the consumer is looking for, they’re getting the battery with the best combination of range, power and price for the application.”

The current battery chemistry offers high range and performance, perfect for vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq and Vistiq. The LFP chemistry is less expensive and still gives the range it needs, Brinley said, whereas the future battery chemistry ― lithium manganese-rich batteries ― will benefit production of large trucks and SUVs.

Remote workers will have to return to the office at least four days a week – up from three – or take a buyout as CEO Brian Niccol works to turnaround the coffee chain’s prolonged sales slump.

The company's new in-office requirement will apply to all office workers starting in October, Niccol said Monday.

Starbucks is offering employees who decide to leave the company a one-time voluntary exit program that includes a cash payment.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in a statement. “We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

Many office workers got hooked on remote work as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down offices across America.

Five years later, a growing number of employers from Amazon to JPMorgan Chase are winding back the clock on remote work.

Starbucks began requiring employees to return to the office at least three days a week in 2023. Now it will also require all corporate people managers working remotely to relocate to Seattle or Toronto within 12 months.

Across industries, the moves have not always been popular with employees. Three-quarters of employed adults who have a job that can be done from home are working remotely at least some of the time, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. If their employer no longer allowed them that flexibility, nearly half said they would be unlikely to stay on.

Also unpopular is the perception of a double standard for executives. Some top executives run their businesses from the comfort of their home office hundreds or even thousands of miles from the corporate headquarters.

Niccol has been Starbucks’ highest-profile remote worker. Last year, the company lured him from Chipotle Mexican Grill with a deal that permits him to commute 1,600 miles from his Newport Beach, California, home to the company’s Seattle headquarters on the company’s private jet and on its dime.

Starbucks says Niccol now has an office and a residence in Seattle.

Niccol’s arrangement attracted a lot of media attention, “putting him in an uncomfortable position,” said Stanford University economics professor Nick Bloom, who studies remote work.

“I suspect part of this move is also for Niccol to reestablish himself as the tough in-person leader and move away from being seen as some kind of work-from-home champion.”

The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.

“This is a Renaissance moment for health in America,” U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.

About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn’t identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.

The national focus on artificial food dyes is “a good step to take,” but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.

“Just taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,” she said. “It still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.”

However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called “a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.”

The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.

Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that “most children have no adverse effects” when consuming foods made with them.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.

The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.

Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that “encourages” them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.

Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won’t guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.

“Talk is cheap,” Galligan said. “It’s easy for companies to make promises to look like they’re being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.”

“First, it addresses the regions shortage of industrial land by repurposing a large unutilized brownfield site into a best-in-class industrial park.","In Metro Vancouver, where industrial land is in critically short supply, Montrose Industries has made a groundbreaking move. The company transformed a 130-hectare landfill, once used for demolition, construction, and land-clearing waste, into the Richmond Industrial Centre (RIC), the region’s largest single-owner-developed business park. Lauded for its innovative approach to regulatory hurdles and infrastructure development, the project is now considered a model for brownfield remediation across Canada.

Located at Blundell Road and Pierson Road, the site reflects Montrose Properties’ commitment to economic growth through sustainable and responsible redevelopment and the project team has been lauded for its outstanding work.

In 2024, the project was recognized by an awards program that celebrates excellence in brownfield projects nationally. The Richmond Industrial Centre Development received the award for “Best Overall Project” at the 25th annual Brownie Awards.

Hosted in partnership with the Canadian Brownfields Network (CBN) and Actual Media Inc., the Brownie Awards recognize excellence in brownfield redevelopment across the country. Spanning across categories like policy, technological innovation, sustainable design, and community engagement, the awards celebrate the wide-ranging impact of turning contaminated sites into productive community assets.

Industrial land crunch in Metro Vancouver

Metro Vancouver is facing a well-documented, critically short supply of industrial land, driven by population growth, rising e-commerce demands, and the expansion of logistics and warehousing sectors.

This shortage has major economic implications. Industrial lands support over 450,000 direct and indirect jobs, contribute $50.1 billion to GDP, and generate $92.5 billion in economic output, roughly one-third of the region’s GDP, according to a report from the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade. With industrial jobs paying over 10 per cent above the national average, the need to repurpose underutilized land has become a pressing issue.

Developers and municipalities are rethinking underutilized or overlooked brownfield sites as opportunities to meet the growing economic demand while maintaining environmental integrity.

Building a hub for industry

Historically, the Richmond Industrial Centre site functioned as a construction waste landfill beginning in the 1970s. Its transformation into a major logistics hub required a long-term vision, extensive engineering, and innovative regulatory navigation. In response to Metro Vancouver’s critical shortage of industrial land, Montrose Properties, working alongside PGL Environmental Consultants, the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Omicron, and the City of Richmond, spearheaded the redevelopment of the 130-hectare site. The project has already delivered 1.4 million square feet of industrial distribution space, with an additional 1.8 million square feet in the pipeline.

A conventional phased development approach conflicted with provincial regulations, particularly in relation to active landfill operations. To resolve this, Montrose and its partners developed a precedent-setting strategy that aligned overlapping regulatory frameworks, including the Landfill Operational Certificate and the BC Contaminated Sites Regulation Instrument, ultimately setting a model for future brownfield redevelopment in British Columbia.

The project underwent a rigorous process of site investigation, remediation, risk assessment, and in-situ risk management. This allowed for the redevelopment of closed sections of the landfill, even while other areas continued to accept waste, an innovative and pioneering regulatory strategy in the province.

To date, five areas of the site have achieved regulatory closure. Four buildings have been completed and are now home to high-profile tenants. At full buildout, the brownfield site will feature 12 industrial warehouse buildings located strategically near Canada’s largest port.

“The project impacts the community in several ways,” explains Tony Morgan, Chief Financial Officer, Montrose Properties. “First, it addresses the regions shortage of industrial land by repurposing a large unutilized brownfield site into a best-in-class industrial park. Secondly, the region benefits from the economic impact of increased property taxes, development cost charges and new jobs. We are deeply honoured that our project has been recognized. This award validates the tremendous effort put forth by our team and key partners in transforming a closed landfill site into much-needed industrial warehouse space. We believe this project provides a valuable template for others to follow in remediating disused landfill sites and converting them into productive lands.”

Economic growth and environmental impact

RIC has significantly boosted industrial productivity and economic growth, attracting major tenants such as Coca-Cola, Wayfair, Canadian Tire, and WorldPac. These businesses bring long-term employment opportunities and have helped expand the city’s tax base. This, in turn, enables the City of Richmond to invest in new infrastructure, improve public services, and support future economic development.

Designed to meet the latest ASHRAE energy efficiency standards, the RIC’s buildings feature sustainable technologies such as LED lighting with motion sensors, insulated tilt-up panels, and electric vehicle charging stations. The site’s tenants hold long-term leases, ensuring their ongoing contributions to local employment and community initiatives.

The environmental benefits of the project extend beyond the buildings themselves. Perimeter restoration work around the landfill has included the removal of invasive plant species and the replanting of native vegetation, enhancing riparian habitat. A long-term monitoring plan will support the establishment of these ecosystems, with future development plans also incorporating a new wetland area.

In addition, the adjacent landfill, still in operation and managed by Ecowaste, a wholly owned subsidiary of Montrose Industries, provides essential recycling and landfilling services for construction and demolition waste. This helps reduce illegal dumping on nearby agricultural lands, cuts down transportation costs for clients, and supports Metro Vancouver’s zero waste goals by diverting material from unauthorized or inefficient disposal.

New future for former wastelands

The Richmond Industrial Centre has redefined how brownfield sites can be regenerated to deliver enduring economic and social benefits. By maximizing the land’s potential, the project has increased local employment, strengthened supply chains, and generated significant tax revenue for both municipal and provincial governments.

The site has seen several transformations over time: initially used for peat mining, then as a landfill for construction and demolition waste, and now as a Class A industrial park home to major distribution centres.

Once destined to remain vacant for generations, the site now generates vital tax revenue, jobs, and public amenities. The project didn’t just deliver industrial space; it reshaped how brownfield reinvestment can meet land demands while supporting long-term sustainability.

“To give partners time to adjust, this expectation will begin with the new fiscal year,” Niccol wrote in the memo.
When Niccol was named CEO last year, Starbucks allowed him to remain in Newport Beach.
Starbucks, for its part, maintains that its office return policy is necessary to drive collaboration and accelerate business recovery.
“As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever,” Niccol said in his memo.","Starbucks will increase its return to work mandate for corporate employees to four days a week — even as CEO Brian Niccol is allowed to work remotely from his California home after getting hired last year.

The new policy, outlined in a companywide message from Niccol, will require corporate employees and managers to be on-site Monday through Thursday at the company’s Seattle and Toronto offices as well as at its North American regional hubs, beginning in January.

“To give partners time to adjust, this expectation will begin with the new fiscal year,” Niccol wrote in the memo.

“We’ll share more details before October, including our plans to ensure everyone has an assigned dedicated desk.”

The shift from three to four required days in the office marks the latest escalation in Starbucks’ broader “Back to Starbucks” turnaround strategy helmed by Niccol, whose main residence is in Newport Beach, Calif.

The company says Niccol’s “default” is to reside in Seattle when he isn’t traveling to the company’s coffeehouses worldwide.

When asked if Niccol works from his California residence, the company declined to comment.

The java giant also is expanding its relocation mandate, requiring all managers at its corporate locations to move to Seattle, Toronto or cities that host regional offices within the next 12 months — a policy that builds on a previous directive for vice presidents and above.

When Niccol was named CEO last year, Starbucks allowed him to remain in Newport Beach.

The company pays for a dedicated remote office near his home, provides a personal assistant and allows him to use a corporate jet to commute to Seattle, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Niccol was awarded roughly $96 million in total compensation after his first four months as Starbucks CEO, with about 94% of that coming from stock awards and an additional $5 million sign-on bonus, the filing showed.

His pay package also included more than $400,000 in perks such as housing, jet travel and security expenses. His annualized pay is estimated at $113 million, placing him among the highest-paid CEOs in the country.

Before tapping the former Chipotle boss, Starbucks was grappling with significant turmoil, including four CEOs in five years, declining sales, profit drops and operational inefficiencies like overcomplicated menus and slow service.

The company also faced labor unrest, legal challenges, and brand identity confusion, while external pressures such as inflation and rising competition further strained performance and investor confidence.

Starbucks has stated that while Niccol is permitted to work remotely, he is expected to spend a significant amount of time at the Seattle corporate headquarters and at company locations around the world.

A company spokesperson previously said that “Brian’s primary office and a majority of his time will be spent in our Seattle Support Centre or out visiting partners and customers in our stores, roasteries, roasting facilities and offices around the world.”

“His schedule will exceed the hybrid work guidelines and workplace expectations we have for all partners,” the spokesperson said.

In his message, Niccol emphasized that human connection remains a foundational value for Starbucks.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together,” he wrote.

“We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster.”

He acknowledged that not all employees would welcome the policy.

“We’ve listened and thought carefully,” he wrote. “But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

Starbucks said it will offer a one-time voluntary exit package for employees who refuse to comply with the new policy.

“If you decide you want to leave Starbucks for any reason, we respect that,” Niccol wrote.

“To support those who decide to ‘opt out,’ we’re offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.”

The internal changes come amid wider scrutiny over executive remote work arrangements.

A recent study by researchers at Boston College and Arizona State University, as cited in the Star Tribune, found that companies led by CEOs who live far from their corporate headquarters often see lower employee satisfaction and weaker financial performance.

The report, which examined nearly 1,000 firms between 2010 and 2019, concluded that so-called “fly-in CEOs” tend to be less informed about day-to-day operations and more focused on short-term gains.

The study noted that about 18% of companies surveyed had CEOs residing far from headquarters.

Geographic trends showed that remote CEOs were more common in colder, landlocked central US states. Despite its climate, Minnesota, for example, had one of the lowest rates of remote CEOs among its Fortune 500 firms.

Starbucks, for its part, maintains that its office return policy is necessary to drive collaboration and accelerate business recovery.

These include revamping its menus and coffee shops as well as reversing rules for its cafes in North America that allowed people to use their facilities even if they had not bought anything.

Previously, people were allowed to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase.

Earlier this year, the firm cut 1,100 jobs.

The Seattle-based coffee giant will also force managers who work remotely to relocate to corporate offices in Seattle or Toronto. Employees who aren’t managers but have remote-work status will be allowed to keep it.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol told employees in an internal memo made public Monday that the policy shift was intended to reestablish the company’s in-office culture.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach. We’ve listened and thought carefully,” he said. “But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

Niccol also said that if anyone wants to leave the company, for any reason, Starbucks is “offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.”

Starbucks instituted a three-day in-office work policy in January 2023. Employees were expected to come into the office Tuesday and Wednesday each week with teams deciding on a third day. Niccol, who isn’t based in Seattle, escalated enforcement of the policy earlier this year.

Per the terms of his offer letter last August, Niccol wasn’t forced to relocate to Seattle and would be provided with a remote office in Newport Beach, Calif. He was also given the use of a corporate jet for work travel.

Niccol does have an office and residence in Seattle that he mostly uses when he’s not visiting coffeehouses and other locations, according to Starbucks.

The move to four days a week is the latest from Niccol as he tries to turn Starbucks around from the inside out. He was hired away from Chipotle last year.

Niccol oversaw a wave of corporate layoffs earlier this year. The company let go of 1,100 corporate employees, more than 600 of whom were based at the Seattle headquarters in Sodo. About 3,000 employees are based at the Sodo office.

While announcing the layoffs, Niccol said the move was an effort to streamline the company’s corporate workforce and create “smaller, more nimble teams.” Hundreds of open roles also disappeared.

Niccol is making his mark in Starbucks cafes as well. He has piloted new ordering systems to get drinks out faster, pumped money into TV and radio advertising, and brought back ceramic mugs. The company also removed the upcharge for alternative milks.

Starbucks is the latest Seattle-area employer to dial up in-office requirements.

U.S. adults are concerned that tariffs will cause tech product prices to surge, according to a CNET survey released last week

Nearly two-thirds of consumers said they recently bought or plan to buy a tech product soon to avoid higher prices or supply shortages, the survey of more than 2,400 adults found.

Those fears may be warranted, as new reciprocal tariffs against several countries, including tech powerhouses Japan and South Korea, are set to take effect Aug. 1.

Dive Insight:

Consumers have been anxious about tariff-induced price hikes and supply shortages since the Trump administration started a trade war earlier this year. Those concerns have been exacerbated by the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy, including on-again, off-again levies against key U.S. trade partners.

Businesses should view the turmoil as an opportunity to build trust with consumers through clear and transparent messaging across all channels, said Carla Bevins, professor of business communications at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

“If you are not customer-centered, it can come across as tone deaf or even opportunistic,” Bevins said.

A number of tariffs are slated to take effect Aug. 1, including a 25% tariff on goods from Japan and South Korea alongside 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico.

However, it’s unclear when consumers will feel the full effects of the tariffs, as the pause has given retailers more time to stockpile goods.

In June, more than one-third of U.S. adults reported they had, at some point, felt pressured to purchase goods of any kind due to tariff concerns, a slight decline from March, according to the survey.

Another 17% of consumers reported purchasing items of any kind due to tariff anxiety, according to the survey.

In the tech category, U.S. adults are most concerned that tariffs will raise the prices of smartphones, appliances and laptops. Nearly 2 in 5 consumers reported purchasing or planning to purchase a smartphone, while 33% and 31% said the same for appliances and laptops, respectively.

Medtronic’s renal denervation (RDN) business is in the early stages of a new project to add a key feature to its minimally invasive hypertension technology as it makes progress on a new catheter design and treats its first patients in a study of multi-organ denervation.

“We’re advancing our catheter and advancing our procedural approach at the same time,” Medtronic RDN GM Jason Fontana said in a Medical Design & Outsourcing interview.

Through what the team calls Project Pulsar, Medtronic has developed a next-generation catheter with a longer length for transradial wrist access instead of femoral access. Radial access is gaining traction for catheter procedures like percutaneous coronary interventions thanks to better outcomes than femoral access.

“We’re trying to head down the pathway of a wrist-based approach to doing renal denervation, because we know from the coronary perspective it’s safer with less adverse events for patients. They’re able to go home sooner. You don’t have that potential for femoral bruising or leg bruising,” Fontana said.

“Renal denervation is an incredibly safe procedure,” he later continued. “In all our clinical trials and clinical studies, there’s been very few adverse events. The general risks of the procedure, I would put into the same categories as any interventional procedure. The risks are more related to the procedure access than anything else. In an anything-that-could-happen world, the fear going into this was whether there would be any stenosis of the renal artery or impact to the renal artery. We’ve seen pristine safety from a restenosis perspective.”

Feedback has been positive from physicians using the Symplicity Spyral catheter for RDN and in the multi-organ study, Fontana said. The catheter can expand enough to treat both the renal and hepatic arteries, so there won’t be significant changes to the therapeutic end of the catheter.

“The performance of the catheter has been really fantastic across the board: utilization, deliverability, it’s been great,” he said. “[At Medtronic, that’s] been something that we’ve been proud of forever with our stents, balloons and guides.”

Medtronic’s Project Gemini

Medtronic’s Spyral GEMINI pilot program (an abbreviation for Global pilot study of rEnal and hepatic coMbINed denervatIon) is comparing RDN against denervation of the arteries in both the kidneys and the liver.

“We’re trying to take more variability out of the conversation,” Fontana said. “There’s always variability with the patient, and we’re trying to get bigger drops in blood pressure and/or more response. Our approach to doing that is to lower the sympathetic nerve activity in the kidney, and then the next big area is the liver. … We did the preclinical work and we presented at ACC that [exactly] that happened: If you add hepatic to renal, you get bigger drops and tighter drops in norepinephrine, the signal from the kidney. We had all this preclinical work, we knew we could do it safely, we knew our algorithm was designed for the hepatic artery, and now we’ve had our first patients.”

“This is kind of a pilot design because it’s never been done before,” he continued. “It’s the first time we’re we’re putting our catheter into the hepatic artery in a human. We have an off-med trial and we have an on-med trial, and we’re basically using the datasets we’ve created as our backdrop to compare this approach to.”

Medtronic has tweaked its RDN generator’s energy delivery algorithm for the multi-organ denervation procedure.

“What we’ve learned preclinically is that the common hepatic artery is made up a little bit different than than your renal artery for appropriate reasons — it’s a different organ,” Fontana said. “We adjusted the algorithm for the tissue we’re going to be delivering energy to in the liver. It’s a little bit thicker of a vessel wall, it’s got a little bit different adventitia.”

Medtronic is using two separate generators in the multi-organ study, but they’re working to offer both energy algorithms in a single generator, Fontana said.

The multi-organ approach offers a lesson for other device developers.

“At a macro level, if you’re an engineer, you tend to get focused on your one area,” Fontana said. “We were focused on the kidney and sympathetic activity in the kidney, and literally the liver has been staring at us the entire time. Every patient we’ve ever treated, it’s right there, and you realize there’s so much sympathetic activity in the liver that maybe we weren’t thinking about. Then you understand it, you learn more about it and realize you can take that opportunity. We learned there was sympathetic nerve activity there — it’s obviously there for a reason — and we’re able to take advantage of it. So if you’re an engineer, you may be focused on that one thing, but every once in a while, pull back a little bit and just see what you’re doing and where else it could be done or where else it could be applicable.”

Medtronic’s Project Galileo

As Medtronic moves forward on Project Pulsar and Project Gemini, there’s a new space-themed program in the works in Ireland. Project Galileo will try to find a signal of intraprocedural efficacy so the physician knows the job is done, Fontana said.

“That’s looking at changes in constriction of the vessels, both pre- and post-renal denervation,” he said. “… Think of it like mapping for atrial fibrillation. … With renal denervation, we treat and then we look to the blood pressure. If there was a way that we could do our treatment and then check and say, ‘OK, we got all the nerves, we’re done,’ that’s what we’re at the beginnings of right now with Galileo. … You’d want to use the same catheter, but use a different energy level and then measure an impact.”

While the Medtronic RDN team’s focus is on hypertension for now, there’s potential for multi-organ denervation to treat other conditions like diabetes.

Related: Medtronic execs say renal denervation for AFib could be on the horizon

“There’s some interesting cardiometabolic options that potentially down the road could be addressed,” Fontana said. “… We’re focused on making sure we can do a safe and effective procedure, and then the next steps will follow.”

We asked whether RDN can help Medtronic remain the world’s largest device company after separating from its diabetes business.

“Unfortunately, hypertension is a really big problem around the world,” he said. “… Our diabetes separation is about focus in both areas. We know diabetic patients need focus, and our team has done a great job there. The partnership with Abbott, everything we’re doing, that’s going to really drive focus there. And then on our side and on the Medtronic side, RDN, pulsed-field ablation, tricuspid, mitral, even in the cardiovascular space, there are these big areas of opportunity that now we can heavily focus on. And then if you think about Hugo and surgical and [neuromod], Medtronic’s been able to now really double down on some of these big areas. RDN for patients with hypertension has that opportunity to be one of these growth-drivers going forward.”",https://www.medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Medtronic-Symplicity-Spyral-renal-denervation-catheter-hand.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:03.478748

Dive Brief:

Starbucks will require corporate employees to come into the office four days a week starting in October, the beginning of the brand’s next fiscal year, the chain said in a Monday letter from CEO Brian Niccol.

The chain extended its in-person requirement from vice presidents to now encompass all support center people leaders. They must be based in the Seattle or Toronto offices within the next 12 months.

In March, Starbucks laid off 6.9% of its non-cafe workforce and required many leaders to return to in-person work.

Dive Insight:

This latest policy change comes more than two years after Starbucks began shifting corporate employees back to in-office roles, a decision that at the time pushed some corporate employees to petition the coffee giant to abandon RTO policies and sign an election agreement with Starbucks Workers United.

Starbucks will continue to maintain some in-market corporate roles and will not require “individual contributors to relocate,” according to the letter. However, future hiring for corporate roles — and lateral moves within the company — will require workers to be based in the Seattle or Toronto areas.

Niccol framed the latest increase in RTO requirements as a way to reestablish “our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together.”

However, Niccol said that employee’s “work may take you outside the office, including visiting stores, meeting suppliers, or other business travel. You should continue to go where you need to go to be successful.”

Workers can leave early or step out for pressing appointments and other personal matters, he added.

Starbucks will offer a one-time cash payment for workers who decide to leave the company rather than return to office. Niccol said the company would share more details on the voluntary departure package with employees soon.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/I8NdrngnsgfNxMN98ZxlCH0hc5hM2B0n82Sm0tSn7Yk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTU5ODY3MjQwX2dhYkxCbVouanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:11.327844

How Philips Improved Image Management?","Navigating the sea of visual content is a growing challenge for companies that rely on marketing campaigns. For businesses like Philips, streamlining their image libraries with AI solutions offers a reprieve from manual sorting, while enhancing brand consistency. The collaboration between Philips and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud’s Vertex AI underscores a push toward faster and more efficient digital asset management in the corporate world, reflecting a broader trend in utilizing technological advancements to solve practical issues.

During past years, Philips faced significant hurdles in organizing and maintaining a cohesive image library due to the sheer volume of content. Although systems like traditional metadata management strategies were frequently employed, they often led to disconnected or outdated results when image variants were modified. However, other companies leveraging AI find similar advancements advantageous in reducing operational backlogs, which historically slowed down marketing campaigns.

How Philips Improved Image Management?

Philips tackled the issue by deploying a custom algorithm that employs computer vision through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. This approach enabled the company to sort out 8,000 high-quality images from a pool of 200,000 in mere hours.

“Properly managing the life cycle of these assets is critical,” said Claudia Calori, Philips’ head of marketing excellence.

Such utilization of computer vision allowed them to identify similarities based on core visual features without resorting to outdated metadata.

What Advantages Does the AI Offer?

This automated process not only saves substantial time but also enhances the accuracy and quality of image selection. By modernizing their digital asset management, Philips aims to mitigate compliance risks and ensure that marketing materials are coherent and compliant across various channels. Thereby, they focus more on creativity and strategic initiatives. AI supports additional functions like faster testing and efficient campaign launches, which optimize marketing operations.

The technology delves deeper into the visual makeup of images via embeddings, which are mathematical representations of an image’s features like shapes and patterns. As businesses increasingly embrace AI, such systems present significant advantages over manual handling, allowing for a sharper focus on innovative product and service designs.

Developers’ integration of this technology as a tool for creativity highlights an evolution in corporate strategy. Large-scale companies are now more poised to maintain brand integrity while channeling efforts into future technological enhancements.

“Using image embeddings, the system delivers instant results, even scanning hundreds of thousands of images,” Calori noted.

This shift towards adopting AI for managing digital assets reflects wider efficiency gains across the industry.

Beyond addressing the immediate organizational challenges, Philips’ transition to AI-managed assets sketches a potential path in transforming marketing content strategies for other enterprises as well. By automating intensive processes, companies can foster stronger consumer engagement and trust, maintaining brand consistency.

Looking ahead, the integration of AI into areas like asset management will likely grow, bearing implications for various industries striving to harmonize large data sets for enhanced operational results. Businesses might encounter fewer bottlenecks, seeing improvements in compliance and the agility of marketing campaigns due to these technological advancements.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-012-6.png,N,,2025-07-14 20:03:51.709604

With imports now constituting over 35% of apparent steel consumption in South Africa, the operational integrity and future sustainability of Amsa—and the entire domestic steel sector—appear precarious.","ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa) is staring down the barrel of a difficult period as it prepares for the potential wind-down of its Longs Business—an option that could be realised far ahead of the previously indicated September 30, 2025 deadline. This sobering outlook comes amid ongoing struggles attributed to governmental infrastructure deficiencies and policy missteps that continue to burden the steel producer.

This announcement, made shortly after Amsa forecast slightly reduced headline earnings losses for the six months ending June 30, provoked a sharp reaction from investors. On Monday afternoon, the firm’s share price plummeted by 7.89% to 105 cents on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, a stark decline from over R5 a share just three years ago. The market’s cautious response underscores growing concerns around the company’s sustainability.

Earlier this year, on March 31, Amsa had temporarily deferred its initial plan to wind down the Long Steel Business, seeking leeway until September 30 after securing a R1.68 billion funding facility from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). However, despite these measures, the facility is now fully drawn and Amsa confirmed that it would continue operations through the third quarter while honouring commitments to its customers.

The company’s directors noted with concern that “limited” progress has been made in addressing significant structural issues during this deferral period. An influx of high imports continues to saturate the domestic market, compounding the burden on Amsa’s operations. Moreover, Transnet’s rail performance has hit record lows, forcing the company to shoulder elevated operational risks and mounting costs.

Challenges plaguing Amsa have persisted over several years, ranging from structural distortions exacerbated by the Preferential Pricing System and export taxes favouring scrap-based steelmakers, to policies that fail to provide adequate protection against imports. Additionally, persistent circumvention of tariff protections by local companies, coupled with a lack of prosecution, has further complicated the industry landscape.

Adding to these woes, Amsa has reported a series of rail service interruptions triggered by an unprecedented wave of cable theft and locomotive failures, which jeopardised operations at its blast furnaces and necessitated unplanned road transport. This decision has incurred an extra R317 million in direct and operational costs during the current reporting period, compounding the already strained financial situation.

In the midst of these operational hurdles, Amsa has been exploring various strategic options since March, while the IDC continues to conduct due diligence and the government seeks structural interventions. The company’s directors have warned that, without timely solutions, they may have no choice but to implement operational measures to prepare for an earlier-than-expected closure of the Longs Business.

Despite these challenges, Amsa has projected a 15% improvement in earnings per share, expecting a loss of between R0.82 and R0.93 for the six months ending June 30, a modest reduction from last year’s loss of R1.09 per share. The full details of this interim performance are set to be disclosed on July 31.

As the global steel industry grapples with a cyclical downturn that has lasted almost two years—a duration notably longer than the norm—Amsa is not immune to these market forces. According to the World Steel Association, global crude steel production dipped by 1.3% from January to May 2025 compared to the same period last year.

Domestically, the economic landscape remains bleak. With all sectors, barring agriculture, contributing to a dim annual GDP outlook, Amsa finds itself grappling with sluggish demand in key steel-consuming industries like construction, automotive, and mining. Sales volumes for flat steel products are being adversely affected by high volumes of imports, while uncertainty around the future of long steel products continues to hinder sales projections.

With imports now constituting over 35% of apparent steel consumption in South Africa, the operational integrity and future sustainability of Amsa—and the entire domestic steel sector—appear precarious. The steel and manufacturing industries recently expressed their disillusionment with government policies in front of the portfolio committee responsible for trade, industry, and competition, further signalling a call for immediate and effective reforms.",https://newsnote.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ArcelorMittal-South-Africa-s-net-asset-value-per-share-of-R5-91-was-down-by-42-Picture-Supplied.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 22:59:30.357962

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company’s back-to-office mandate will increase from three days a week to four days a week for corporate workers as part of his Back to Starbucks transformation plan.

The shift — which will require most corporate employees to work in the office Monday through Thursday starting in October — follows in the footsteps of other major American companies like Disney, Ford, and Intel that have implemented similar mandates in the past couple of years.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture. because we do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in a press announcement. “We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

The shift will begin at the beginning of Starbucks’ fiscal year in October, and applies to the Seattle and Toronto Support Centers as well as North America regional offices. Additionally, remote workers at the vice president level and up and support center leaders will need to make plans to move to the Seattle or Toronto area. Also, future hires and lateral moves within the organization will need to be Seattle or Toronto-based.

For employees who wish to opt out of this new mandate, the company is offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment option.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,” Niccol said. “We’ve listened and thought carefully. But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

The regulatory focus is not limited to explicit ""no artificial dyes"" statements.
Industry Reaction Following federal and state pressure, major brands have announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. product lines.
Both companies have stated that they will phase out FD&C artificial dyes by the end of 2027.
The removal of artificial dyes by industry leaders is rapidly setting new expectations for ingredient transparency and marketing accuracy across the CPG sector.","The regulatory landscape for consumer-packaged goods (CPG) brands is shifting, with artificial food dyes emerging as a central focus of both state and federal scrutiny. Recent actions by the federal and state governments, most notably in Texas, have placed a spotlight on the marketing and labeling practices of major food manufacturers, particularly those making claims about the absence of artificial dyes or the healthfulness of their products that include artificial dyes. This heightened attention is not limited to a single company or product category, and it signals a broader trend that could reshape compliance expectations and litigation risk across the food and beverage industry.

The significance of this development lies in its potential to trigger a wave of regulatory investigations, consumer class actions and reputational challenges for brands that market products as ""healthy,"" ""natural"" or ""free from artificial additives"" while still using synthetic dyes. As public health authorities and consumer advocates intensify their calls for transparency and reformulation, CPG companies should reassess their ingredient disclosures, marketing strategies and risk management protocols to navigate this evolving landscape.

Texas Targets Artificial Dye Use in Food Products

Following the announcements by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Food and Drug Administration of their plans to phase out artificial dyes in U.S. food products, Texas launched investigations into the use of artificial dyes by various large CPG companies based on potential violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, these companies may have misled consumers by marketing products as ""healthy"" and artificial dye-free while still containing synthetic dyes such as Red 40 and Yellow 6. The regulatory focus is not limited to explicit ""no artificial dyes"" statements. Broad health-related claims such as ""'good source of vitamins and minerals,"" ""healthy,"" ""all natural"" or other clean label claims will be under scrutiny if those products contain artificial dyes.

The Texas investigations are significant not only for their immediate implications for the targeted companies being investigated, but also for their potential to set a precedent for how similar claims are evaluated and enforced across the food and beverage industry. These actions underscore the importance of rigorous internal controls, transparent ingredient disclosures and substantiated marketing practices for brands operating in an increasingly scrutinized regulatory environment. Any disconnect between marketing claims and actual ingredients can expose brands to both regulatory and civil actions.

Industry Reaction

Following federal and state pressure, major brands have announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. product lines. On June 18, 2025, Kraft Heinz and General Mills announced that they will be removing artificial dyes from their products sold in the U.S. Both companies have stated that they will phase out FD&C artificial dyes by the end of 2027. General Mills also stated that it will be prioritizing the removal of such dyes in its cereals sold in K-12 schools by summer 2026. And Kraft Heinz will not launch new products in the U.S. that include FD&C colors moving forward. The removal of artificial dyes by industry leaders is rapidly setting new expectations for ingredient transparency and marketing accuracy across the CPG sector.

Takeaways

The possible splitfirst reported by The Wall Street Journalwould likely leave Kraft Heinz with brands like Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard, while legacy Kraft-branded items would go to the new company. A spokesperson confirmed that the company has been evaluating strategic transactions since May to unlock shareholder value.

Kraft Heinz stock closed up 2.5% on the day; the company currently holds a market capitalization of $31.3 billion. A final decision on the spinoff could emerge in the coming weeks, though plans may still change.

The proposed move echoes Kellogg's (KLG, Financials) 2023 decision to spin off its cereal businesswhich had suffered volume declinesinto WK Kellogg, which was recently acquired by Ferrero for $3.1 billion. Analysts say other packaged food makers could follow suit; the industry faces a tough mix of inflationary headwinds, cost-conscious consumers, and demand for healthier, fresher alternatives.

Kraft Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil's 3G Capital, has struggled in recent years. In April, the company slashed its full-year forecast after a weak quarter; last month, it also halted U.S. product launches involving artificial food dyes after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushed for regulatory action.

Connor Rattigan of Consumer Edge said the move is part of a larger trend in which consumer packaged goods companies are reevaluating their category exposure; M&A or corporate restructurings may offer a way out, he said; but investors will be watching closely to see whether this is a quick fixor the start of something more strategic.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.finance.gurufocus/a004ddbce557262dd0c06f7ce1e367e7,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:24.381101

“And adoption is achieved when behaviors [change, not just when the features ship].” Adoption in payments follows a U-curve.
Behavioral economists call this “social proof.” “Building the product isn’t the same as building the habit, and that’s where the best ideas can fall short,” Lugo said.
One standout example in payments Lugo cited was Zelle, the peer-to-peer payments platform launched by a consortium of major banks.
“Adoption isn’t a one-time event,” Lugo said.","From QR codes and tokenized wallets to instant settlement networks and blockchain rails, the technological underpinnings of payments are evolving faster than most adjacent sectors.

Yet, for all the feats of engineering, true success in this domain is dictated not by what is possible but by what is adopted. The most lasting innovations in payments can frequently center on a deceptively simple question: Will people actually use this?

“Innovation alone doesn’t create impact. Adoption does,” Dani Lugo, the U.S. payments strategy lead at Bank of America, told PYMNTS. “And adoption is achieved when behaviors [change, not just when the features ship].”

Adoption in payments follows a U-curve. Innovators try first and laggards follow last, but the inflection happens only when the middle masses see the system as mainstream. Behavioral economists call this “social proof.”

“Building the product isn’t the same as building the habit, and that’s where the best ideas can fall short,” Lugo said. “The job of the product team is not to just build what’s possible. It’s to make what’s possible feel natural.”

Designing for Scale Without Losing Simplicity

Understanding that adoption is behavioral leads to the toolkit of behavioral science. The most successful payment platforms in the last decade have not simply been technical marvels; they have been behavioral triumphs.

Technical brilliance is a correlation, not a causation, of widespread usability. One standout example in payments Lugo cited was Zelle, the peer-to-peer payments platform launched by a consortium of major banks.

“Technically it was strong, it was fast, it was secure,” she said. “But at launch, the adoption really lagged despite the strong technical infrastructure.”

Users didn’t understand what it was or how to compare it to existing habits like using Venmo or paying with cash. It wasn’t until Zelle unified its branding across banks and invested in education that adoption took off. That pivot helped the platform surpass $1 trillion in payments in 2024.

“Infrastructure is table stakes, but the adoption truly depends on three Cs: clarity, consistency and confidence,” Lugo said.

Still, in enterprise-scale products, the temptation is to conflate complexity with completeness. But Lugo’s approach flips that logic.

“Simplicity is not necessarily doing less,” she said. “It’s about surfacing what matters most.”

Case in point: Bank of America’s work in Europe on pay by bank, a method allowing users to authorize payments directly from their bank account without card details. Behind the scenes, the back-end mechanics are complex, but what matters most to users is feeling secure and confident.

“Can I check out quickly? Is this safe? Do I know what I’m doing and what I can expect next?” Lugo said.

The Future of Payments Innovation Is Empathetic and Behavioral

As the lines between commerce, content and payments continue to blur, the challenge of adoption will grow more complex. In financial services, where complexity is often assumed as a given, empathy helps product teams build intuitive and relevant experiences.

For example, on CashPro, Bank of America’s digital banking platform for commercial and corporate clients, user feedback inspired several enhancements, including QR sign-in, intelligent transaction search with integrated investigation capabilities, and real-time approvals through the mobile app.

“The goal wasn’t to truly simplify the work [CashPro users] were doing, but to make it more usable and human,” Lugo said. “We respected our users’ time and expectations.”

That respect paid off in the form of increased engagement, faster decision making and deeper client relationships. The shift reflects the broader consumer expectation that business tools should feel as seamless as personal apps.

“Adoption isn’t a one-time event,” Lugo said. “It’s a habit that we build through ongoing empathy, experimentation and evolution of the product.”

Trends Reshaping Product Adoption

As FinTech and payments advance, Lugo said she sees three trends reshaping the future of product adoption: embedded and preemptive experiences; trust by design; and real-time, always-on expectations.

Users expect financial tools to appear contextually — whether in a checkout process, a business platform or a messaging app. But embedded isn’t enough; it must be smart. Through contextual cues like user history, behavior or device type, financial platforms can anticipate preferences, reduce friction and build confidence.

“It’s about presenting the right option at the right time,” Lugo said.

Separately, in an era of digital fatigue and fraud, familiarity and clarity are critical drivers of adoption. When users understand where their money is going and why, trust — and usage — follows. That means that trust is no longer passive. It must be built in through transparent design, intuitive flows and visible safeguards.

“Trust is now an active product feature,” Lugo said.

Ultimately, as the economy becomes 24/7, users expect financial platforms to operate at all hours. This is especially true in the disbursement space. Whether it’s a gig worker getting paid at midnight or a corporate client issuing payments over the weekend, the demand for real-time responsiveness is a business necessity.

“The ability to deliver consistently across channels and time zones isn’t just an operational challenge,” Lugo said. “It’s an adoption imperative.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dani-Lugo-Bank-of-America.png,N,,2025-07-14 20:03:58.365059

The Wegmans announcement encourages consumers to return the recalled products to a customer service desk for a full refund.
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a recall from Danone.","This summer, one trending debate for the nutrition-conscious is the competition between Greek yogurt or cottage cheese, and which packs the bigger protein punch. For younger-spirited palates that aren’t hungry for either pungent protein, there are options, too. For example, Danone, the biggest dairy manufacturer in the country and maker of Activia, Light + Fit, Oikos, and Dannon, also makes a candy-crunch line of yogurt products that are a little more like dessert.

But before you pack that lunchbox for camp, a Monday press release states that Danone U.S. has initiated a nationwide recall of “all flavors and sizes of YoCrunch products currently in-market.” The company says that it’s working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to pull affected products from store shelves.

The voluntary recall is due to the potential presence of plastic pieces in the products’ dome toppers, which the company says “could potentially cause a choking response.” As the company’s release details: “The plastic pieces are transparent, may have sharp edges, and could present a risk to consumers because some pieces are between 7 and 25 [millimeters] in length.” That’s quite small and could be easy for a hungry or distracted eater to miss. Some G.I. experts might add that perforation of the digestive lining could also be a concern.

Worth noting is that the press release specifies that the issue is “isolated only to the separately packaged topper and does not impact the separately packaged yogurt.”

Danone shared the following information about the recall, affecting a total of 17 types of yogurt:

YOCRUNCH STRAW W/GRANOLA 6OZ, UPC 46675000105

A full list of lot numbers and expiration dates, along with product photos, can be found in Danone’s press release.

In a recall announcement on its website, Danone advises consumers not to eat the affected products and urges customers to contact the YoCrunch Consumer Care Line for information on refunds at 1-877-344-4886.

Over the weekend, Northeastern grocery chain Wegmans also announced the recall on its own website, though it only lists six flavors that are affected: Strawberry M&M, M&M Vanilla, Cookies n’ Cream, Vanilla with Oreo Pieces, Vanilla Oreo & M&M, and Vanilla with Milk Chocolate M&Ms.

The Wegmans announcement encourages consumers to return the recalled products to a customer service desk for a full refund.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a recall from Danone. Last year, the company conducted a more targeted recall of YoCrunch Vanilla Lowfat Yogurt with M&Ms for containing “undeclared wheat.” More recently, over 75,000 bottles of coffee creamer from International Delight, another brand owned by Danone, were recalled earlier this year due to “complaints of spoilage.”

The key is using image embeddings.
Image embeddings are mathematical representations of an image’s visual features.
This was how Philips’ image library shrank from 200,000 to 8,000 of the best ones in just hours.
The AI also makes it easier to manage the images across all marketing channels.","Philips, a Dutch health technology company, faced the same issue. So it built a solution using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform to narrow down 200,000 images into the best 8,000 on-brand images in just hours.

The initiative addressed a long-standing challenge: the need to maintain visual consistency across a wide product portfolio and global digital presence. The volume and variety of content created over time had become difficult to organize and maintain using traditional systems.

“We manage a large volume of proprietary assets, many of which historically weren’t fully centralized,” Claudia Calori, Philips’ head of marketing excellence, personal health, told PYMNTS. “Properly managing the life cycle of these assets is critical to maintaining brand consistency and integrity across every touchpoint.”

Companies like Philips are using artificial intelligence (AI) to gain a competitive advantage, according to a PYMNTS Intelligence report. AI has changed from being a buzzword to a business enabler. In the goods and technology sectors, users said they could accelerate early-stage creativity to support concept development, prototyping and visual design.

Nearly 2 out of 3 product leaders use generative AI to innovate products and services, while 38% use it to generate feedback on the production process. Here, generative AI serves as a “creative partner” in the idea phase that turns weeks spent in cross-functional team alignment to surfacing designs in just one meeting, the report said.

At Philips, developers created a custom algorithm that used a form of AI called computer vision to sort images — bypassing the use of file names, manual tags or metadata, which are file descriptions that are often less precise and can be outdated.

Computer vision enabled Philips to compare and group images based on what’s in the image itself, even if the image is cropped, resized or compressed into a different format. The key is using image embeddings.

Image embeddings are mathematical representations of an image’s visual features. These embeddings capture patterns such as color, shapes, composition and textures for the AI to parse through.

“Using image embeddings, the system compares degrees of similarity between images across multiple databases and delivers instant results, even when scanning hundreds of thousands of images at once,” Calori explained. “It’s a metadata-free approach that’s driven entirely by the visual content itself.”

Bypassing the Metadata

Once the embeddings are in place, the AI then does searches based on visual similarities across Philips’ image libraries.

After similar images are identified, the algorithm puts them into groups. From each group, the best version based on quality or newness is chosen as the “master” image. Duplicates and outdated visuals were discarded. This was how Philips’ image library shrank from 200,000 to 8,000 of the best ones in just hours.

Under the old way, “we relied heavily on metadata to track image variants, but as assets were modified, reformatted or reused, that metadata could easily become disconnected or outdated,” Calori said. Using AI that bypassed metadata saved “significant” amounts of time and improved accuracy, freeing the team to focus on strategy and creativity.

The AI also makes it easier to manage the images across all marketing channels. Any revised versions can be traced back to its source to ensure that only approved images are used. This mitigates compliance risks.

“It also allows us to strengthen and ensure compliance, automates what used to be a manual effort and improves the consistency of the assets we present to our customers and consumers,” Calori said. “Ultimately, this helps drive stronger engagement and trust in the brand.”

The system supports additional use cases as well, such as enabling faster A/B testing, accelerating campaign launches, and curating up-to-date asset collections for marketing teams.

“Marketing plays a key role in how we help people take charge of their well-being,” Calori said. “Managing our digital assets effectively supports that mission. It allows us to tell a more consistent, clear story across all touchpoints.”

Philips said the new AI capabilities not only address current operational challenges but also establish a foundation for future innovation in marketing content strategy.

“This innovation marks a major leap forward for Philips’ asset life cycle management strategy,” the company said in a statement. “By using advanced visual matching, Philips can refresh touchpoints faster, limit compliance risk, and maximize the impact of current and new assets.”

Hundreds of locations in California, including all the remaining Rite Aid stores in Stanislaus County, are set to close.

While the Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain initially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2023, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy for a second time in May 2025.

In a May 5 news release, Rite Aid CEO Matt Schroeder said the company has been facing “financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and health care landscapes.”

“As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible,” Schroeder said in the release.

What is Rite Aid?

Rite Aid is a national pharmacy chain that began in 1962 as Thrift D Discount Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, according to the company’s website.

Along with in-store pharmacies, Rite Aid locations sell over-the-counter medications, vitamins, beauty products and household essentials.

Where are Rite Aid locations closing in Stanislaus County? When?

In an earlier round of closures, Rite Aid shut down its location at 1300 West F St. in Oakdale on June 25, followed by its Ceres store at 1830 Mitchell Road, which closed on July 1.

The Rite Aid location at 1707 McHenry Ave. in Modesto closed on July 9.

Rite Aid will close its remaining stores in Stanislaus County later in July.

In Turlock, the Rite Aid location at 653 North Golden State Blvd. will close on Wednesday, July 16, while the store at 1000 West Monte Vista Ave. will close on Thursday, July 17.

Rite Aid will close its last remaining Oakdale location at 1449 East F St., Suite 102, on Monday July 28, while its last remaining location in Modesto will close at 1032 Oakdale Road on Tuesday, July 15.

Although Rite Aid’s official closure list did not include its location at 1935 North St. in Newman, media outlet Westside Connect reported in May that the North Street spot was scheduled to close as part of the pharmacy chain’s bankruptcy proceedings.

As of Monday, July 14, the Newman location was listed as “closed” on Rite Aid’s website.

The hospital claims that Blue KC’s selective auditing of the diagnoses is an intentional strategy to minimize its financial obligations.

The lawsuit, originally filed in Missouri state court in May and moved to federal court on July 2, centers around a dispute over Blue KC’s use of clinical validation audits to retrospectively reject diagnosis codes tied to inpatient hospital claims. Merriam, Kan.-based Shawnee Mission alleges that the audits, performed by third-party vendors, routinely overturn its physicians’ documented diagnoses without meaningful engagement or adequate justification, thereby violating the two organizations’ contract.

The complaint specifically mentions Apixio, a vendor hired by Blue KC in early 2024 to conduct clinical audits after the insurer had previously used another vendor, Cotiviti. According to the complaint, Apixio uses artificial intelligence tools marketed as being able to conduct complex reviews “in minutes, not days,” and has asserted that 60% of inpatient diagnoses are clinically invalid, which AdventHealth called staggering and deeply flawed. The lawsuit alleges that neither Apixio nor Cotiviti consulted with physicians or provided transparency into their qualifications or use of AI in reviewing medical records, arguing that the process bypassed standard medical review safeguards.

AdventHealth is alleging that more than 350 claims involving diagnoses such as malnutrition, respiratory failure, and sepsis were denied, even when supported by patient records and confirmed by providers. The denials are allegedly disproportionately focused on conditions that, when coded, increase reimbursement rates due to their complexity and the resources required to treat them. The hospital claims that Blue KC’s selective auditing of the diagnoses is an intentional strategy to minimize its financial obligations.

The lawsuit is seeking a declaratory judgment stating that Blue KC’s clinical validation audit practices breach the provider agreement and violate the law. AdventHealth is asking the court to require the insurer to pay for denied claims that are documented in medical records and to permanently halt the clinical validation audit process unless performed by qualified personnel in a transparent manner. The hospital is also requesting damages for the alleged underpayments.

“If you don’t like the rates, don’t do the work,” he continued.","Anaesthetists are being paid less for some work than an out of an hours plumber could expect to earn and lower pay is reducing the number of anaesthetists doing private work.

This is according to William Harrop-Griffiths, professor of practice (Anaesthesia) and consultant anaesthetist at Imperial College, London who spoke at the Independent Doctors Federation’s (IDrF) Private Practice Conference.

Pay rates by some insurers for private healthcare treatment have been a major concern for medical practitioners especially over the last two years with the IDrF launching a campaign to rebalance the relationship between doctors and insurers.

Citing the example of emergency laparoscopic surgery, Harrop-Griffiths claimed insurers could pay an anaesthetist anything between £222 and £230 for the two hours’ private work.

While that was less money than a surgeon could expect to be paid, Harrop-Griffiths maintained it was also less money than an out of hours plumber.

“I think we’re worth a little bit more money than an out of hours plumber,” he said.

“The rates for an anaesthetist in the independent sector are far from generous in many, many insurance-related work.”

No-one forces you to do private work

But he conceded there wqas no comulsion for anyone to take on private work.

“Nobody actually forces you at gunpoint to become an anaesthetist,” he continued.

“You only become an anaesthetist if you want to.

“Nobody forces you to do private practice. You do not need to do these things if you don’t particularly want to do.”

Impact of downward pressure on pay rates

Though Harrop-Griffiths warned downward pressure on anaesthetist pay rates has its consequences.

“If you don’t like the rates, don’t do the work,” he continued.

“And if you don’t do the rates, no-one does the work and then the rates will then go up, so I’m not saying we are badly paid,” he added.

“But fewer anaesthetists are entering the world of private practice – partly because of generational changes and lifestyle, but also because the relative rates are going down and down.”",https://healthcareandprotection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/William-Harrop-Griffiths-e1752484287738.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 20:59:11.189581

“Nowadays, with the holiday calendars, especially being pulled forward more, it becomes more important to get brand awareness earlier into the year,” said our analyst Sky Canaves.
Men's personal care: A category in transformation The men's personal care category is experiencing significant growth, outpacing personal care at large, driven by several converging trends.
But men's personal care marketing requires a distinct approach compared to women's beauty marketing, focusing more on outcomes than ingredients.
The vital role of marketplaces Marketplaces play a crucial role in Every Man Jack's ecommerce strategy, offering benefits beyond sales.","Men’s care brand Every Man Jack employs a strategic calendar-based marketing approach that shifts focus throughout the year, responding to consumer behavior and competitive pressures.

“[Our marketing approach] really depends on the time of the year,” said Nick Hasselberg, vice president of performance marketing and ecommerce at men’s care brand Every Man Jack on a recent episode of “Behind the Numbers.” “At the beginning of the year, it’s brand marketing. In the back half of the year, it’s probably a little bit more [about] performance marketing.”

The brand front-loads awareness campaigns at the beginning of the year, recognizing competitors are aggressively generating demand immediately after the holiday season.

""We realized last year that our competitors were not standing pat and really after the holiday focusing intensely on generating awareness and demand,"" Hasselberg explained.

This early-year brand marketing creates a foundation of awareness that the company can leverage in the second half of the year through more performance-focused tactics.

These include rewards programs through partners like Ibotta or Neptune, and increased investment in search marketing to convert aware consumers into customers.

This approach aligns with broader retail trends.

“Nowadays, with the holiday calendars, especially being pulled forward more, it becomes more important to get brand awareness earlier into the year,” said our analyst Sky Canaves.

Men's personal care: A category in transformation

The men's personal care category is experiencing significant growth, outpacing personal care at large, driven by several converging trends.

""Men are increasingly interested in 'better for you' offerings,"" Hasselberg noted, pointing to the rise of clean ingredients in men's products mirroring broader trends.

This shift has been accelerated by social media creating greater appearance consciousness and COVID prompting increased health awareness.

But men's personal care marketing requires a distinct approach compared to women's beauty marketing, focusing more on outcomes than ingredients.

""Beauty shoppers are so much further along the adoption curve. They know what they're looking for. They know what those ingredients are on the back of the bottle,"" said Hasselberg. ""Men still need to be educated. And really for men, it tends to be a bit more outcome focused.""

This education gap means that while ingredient transparency matters, connecting those ingredients to specific benefits is crucial for male consumers who may not understand the significance of components like aloe vera or jojoba beads without clear explanation of their effects.

The vital role of marketplaces

Marketplaces play a crucial role in Every Man Jack's ecommerce strategy, offering benefits beyond sales.

""Marketplaces are vital to this brand's growth. First and foremost, they provide the most consistency in terms of return within marketing, which is essential to planning,"" said Hasselberg.

This consistency helps stabilize marketing performance when other plans encounter challenges.

Marketplaces can also contribute to upper-funnel marketing goals or serve as testing grounds for new products.

“One of our greatest sources of awareness amongst all consumers is seeing us on Amazon or seeing us at Walmart.com,” said Hasselberg.

The brand recently launched a new deodorant on Amazon, using the platform to gather consumer feedback on creative elements, reviews, and purchasing patterns.

These insights can be packaged as proof of concept for approaching wholesale retail partners.

“Reddit is the number one platform for product-related discussions, including health, wellness and beauty,” she said.
The collaboration not only expands CMX’s audience reach but offers brands a chance to tap into the reasons behind purchase behaviors.
“It’s being able to hone in on not just what they purchase, but why they purchase, or maybe even why not, and bring those insights further to our brands,” Walsh said.
“It’s new communities, new ways to engage on discoverability and growth, and it will just yield a lot more transactions for our brands,” Walsh concluded.","CANNES — CVS Media Exchange (CMX), the retail media arm of CVS Health, is teaming up with Reddit to unlock new advertising opportunities for brands, tapping into Reddit’s vast, high-intent communities focused on health, wellness and beauty.

“Our collaboration with Reddit will be available early Q4 of this year,” said Raphaela Walsh, head of product at CMX, during an interview with Jon Watts, managing director of the Coalition for Innovation in Media Measurement, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. “We’re super excited to see the results and performance, and based on that beta, we’ll then look to extend it further.”

Walsh said Reddit’s unmatched role in product discovery and conversation, particularly in health and wellness. “Reddit is the number one platform for product-related discussions, including health, wellness and beauty,” she said. “Over 51% of product mentions actually happen on Reddit, so it’s just a powerful, powerful platform.”

The partnership will integrate CMX’s first-party data, including insights from CVS’s ExtraCare loyalty members, with Reddit’s 108 million daily active users across 100,000 communities. Of particular interest are the 700-plus Reddit communities dedicated to health and wellness, which Walsh described as “really unique conversations that are happening with really high intent.”

Beyond scale, Walsh said both companies share a focus on authenticity, transparency and verification. Reddit’s existing partnerships with brand safety platforms such as DoubleVerify and IAS “really checked the box in a critical way that helped us move forward,” she added.

The collaboration not only expands CMX’s audience reach but offers brands a chance to tap into the reasons behind purchase behaviors.

“It’s being able to hone in on not just what they purchase, but why they purchase, or maybe even why not, and bring those insights further to our brands,” Walsh said.

Walsh framed the partnership as part of a larger trend where consumers move beyond traditional social media to seek peer recommendations and meaningful product discussions.

“It’s not just about social anymore,” she said. “It’s where they can consult with peers on topics that are meaningful for them and where brands can deliver highly targeted offerings with measurement.”

The beta launch is set for later this year, with plans to scale pending performance results. “It’s new communities, new ways to engage on discoverability and growth, and it will just yield a lot more transactions for our brands,” Walsh concluded.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/97873-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 16:07:47.022623

Walgreens expects to close the transaction in the third or fourth quarter of this year, subject to the usual closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
The company will continue to operate under the Walgreens, Boots Duane Reade, No7 Beauty Company and Benavides names.
The Wall Street Journal first reported in December that Sycamore was in talks to take Walgreens private.
ON THE RECORD “We appreciate the consideration and overwhelming support from our shareholders in our value-maximizing transaction with Sycamore,” said Tim Wentworth, Chief Executive Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance.","Shareholders for Walgreens Boots Alliance overwhelmingly voted to approve the company’s sale to Sycamore Partners, with 96% of shareholders at a special meeting voting to green-light the merger, estimated at $23.7 billion.

The initial merger announcement was made on March 6, and at that time it was determined that WBA shareholders will receive $11.45 per share in cash at closing, and one non-transferable Divested Asset Proceeds Right to receive up to an additional $3 in cash per share from the future monetization of WBA’s debt and equity interests in VillageMD, which includes the Village Medical, Summit Health and CityMD businesses.

Walgreens expects to close the transaction in the third or fourth quarter of this year, subject to the usual closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

WHAT’S THE IMPACT

Leveraging WBA's healthcare expertise and Sycamore's established leadership in retail and consumer services, WBA will be better positioned to become the first choice for pharmacy, retail and health services, Walgreens said.

The company will continue to operate under the Walgreens, Boots Duane Reade, No7 Beauty Company and Benavides names. WBA will maintain its headquarters in the Chicago area.

The Wall Street Journal first reported in December that Sycamore was in talks to take Walgreens private. The deal was then considered dead.

In February, the sale was considered on again after CNBC's David Faber said on air that the pharmacy chain may be sold to New York-based private equity firm Sycamore Partners.

Walgreens has suffered losses due in large part to VillageMD. Plans for expansion of the primary care network were scrapped as in late 2023, Walgreens announced a $1 billion cost-cutting initiative. This included the closure of more than 60 VillageMD clinics, a number that grew to 160.

THE LARGER TREND

CVS Health has also suffered profit setbacks from operating losses but has been cushioned by its pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, according to Seeking Alpha.

Walgreens has approximately 12,500 locations across the U.S., Europe and Latin America and employs approximately 311,000 people globally.

ON THE RECORD

“We appreciate the consideration and overwhelming support from our shareholders in our value-maximizing transaction with Sycamore,” said Tim Wentworth, Chief Executive Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance. “With Sycamore’s partnership, we will be better positioned to accelerate our turnaround strategy, further enhance the customer, patient and team member experience and become the first choice for pharmacy, retail and health services.

A smart strategy But don’t worry, anyone who wants the classic Egg McMuffin can still get it.
More than just a product, a cultural evolution The Egg McMuffin isn’t just another item on the menu: it’s part of McDonald’s DNA!","McDonald’s has just announced some changes. Its most iconic breakfast item, the Egg McMuffin (which has been winning over American breakfast tables for over half a century) isn’t going anywhere, let’s be clear, it’s getting a makeover! You and I both know there’s nothing better than an Egg McMuffin breakfast, but market trends are shifting and so are consumer tastes, so Ray Kroc’s favourite breakfast, the founder of McDonald’s, is about to get a new look… and it starts this week!

The goal is to win over new generations, with a spicier, bolder, and more modern version adapted to today’s consumers. Starting July 8, customers will be able to enjoy the new Spicy McMuffin (yummy!) a limited edition that adds the house spicy sauce to the classic recipe. We love it!!

Will it be enough to win the hearts of young spice lovers? It definitely won us over!

The launch is a celebration of the product’s 50th anniversary, but also a clear marketing strategy to keep it alive. McDonald’s has realized that consumer preferences have changed, and that bold, spicy flavours are now the norm, not the exception. Will this move keep the legacy of the Egg McMuffin alive in a world that doesn’t eat breakfast the same way anymore?

A breakfast with history

In 1972, a McDonald’s franchisee named Herb Peterson presented a completely new product to founder Ray Kroc: a breakfast sandwich that combined egg, ham, and cheese in an English muffin. Kroc was hesitant, but after trying it, he was thrilled. The Egg McMuffin became McDonald’s first official breakfast item, opening a new business line and changing the way Americans eat breakfast. Kroc even wrote in his memoirs the three reasons why he liked this breakfast:

He liked the surprise of not knowing what he was going to taste

He was amazed by the presentation and loved the flavour

The Egg McMuffin paved the way in the breakfast market

Since then, the sandwich has remained practically unchanged. But the world has changed, and millennials and gen z are crazy about bold flavours!

Half a century later: new tastes, new generations

Nowadays, consumers don’t just look for speed or convenience. They want bolder, more personalized products with character. And especially among younger people, the love for spicy food has exploded. According to an Instacart survey, 74% of Americans eat hot sauce frequently, and 78% of Gen Z members say they love spicy food. More spice, more flavour, more delicious, don’t you think?

The new Spicy McMuffin

So, since July, all McDonald’s locations across the U.S. will offer three new spicy options: the Spicy McMuffin, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The main difference between them is in the brand’s exclusive spicy sauce, which adds a punch of flavour without changing the base of the product. And if you haven’t tried it, we recommend it because it’s delicious!!

A smart strategy

But don’t worry, anyone who wants the classic Egg McMuffin can still get it. But for those looking for something stronger and different, there’s now a new, eye-catching option. This way, the chain doesn’t risk alienating its most loyal customers while capturing the attention of a new, bolder audience eager to try new flavours!

More than just a product, a cultural evolution

The Egg McMuffin isn’t just another item on the menu: it’s part of McDonald’s DNA! The fact that the chain dares to tweak it, even temporarily, reflects a deep shift in food culture. Traditional breakfast is giving way to more dynamic formats, influenced by globalization, social media, and changing tastes.

They’re also aiming for (free, of course) social media buzz. The Spicy McMuffin won’t just be eaten: it’ll be filmed, shared on TikTok, reviewed on YouTube… It’s a way to keep the brand alive among an audience that consumes experiences!

50 years and still going strong, now it’s reinventing itself too. We’re already looking forward to getting in line to try that bold new flavour, we can’t wait!",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Egg_McMuffin-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:41.746305

Instead, the hackers won the war with a simple guessing game. McHire, McDonald’s AI-powered hiring chatbot, was configured with the default credentials 123456/123456 to access the administration interface for McHire restaurant accounts. No MFA, no brute-force protection, nothing.

Designed by Paradox.ai and deployed across tens of thousands of restaurants globally, McHire automates much of the company’s frontline hiring, from collecting applications to conducting interviews via a bot named “Olivia.” The chatbot had access to detailed personal information on job seekers across dozens of countries, and yet it appears that the keys to its admin panel required nothing more than the most guessable password in digital history.

This wasn’t an elite attack, and that’s exactly what makes it so troubling. It didn’t involve backdoors, rootkits or polymorphic code. It involved typing “123456” into a login box and making one small tweak to a URL.

From exposed cloud environments to third-party vendor vulnerabilities, today’s cyber threats are becoming more varied and insidious. In this new digital battlefield, safeguarding your perimeter is no longer about firewalls or antivirus software. It’s about identity, integration, and insight.

Passwords Make Everything Leaky as Attack Chains Move From Credentials to Chaos

For decades, enterprise cybersecurity strategies revolved around the notion of a clearly defined perimeter: secure what’s inside, keep the bad actors out. But cloud adoption, hybrid work, third-party tools, and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies have fragmented that perimeter into a patchwork of distributed endpoints and unseen attack vectors.

Still, the McHire breach highlights an uncomfortable truth about modern cybersecurity: while companies invest in next-generation technologies, many still fall victim to yesterday’s mistakes. In this case, the most avoidable mistake of all — using a default password — opened the door.

“It’s the tried and true advice that is often given,” Belsasar Lepe, co-founder and CEO of Cerby, stressed to PYMNTS. “Make it easy to turn on multifactor authentication for your end users. Ninety-nine percent of identity attacks are due to a lack of MFA just being turned on.”

One of Amazon’s flagship products, Amazon Web Services (AWS), last summer announced it was pushing ahead with making MFA mandatory for certain users.

Still, part of the problem lies in how technology like McHire is deployed. The McDonald’s franchise system is highly decentralized. Individual restaurant owners, not corporate headquarters, often manage the technology stack that governs hiring, scheduling, and operations. This structure creates opportunities for inconsistency — and gaps. A third-party platform like McHire may be integrated locally, configured quickly, and left largely untouched once operational. That’s how default credentials persist. That’s how no one notices until a researcher stumbles upon them.

McDonald’s did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

Expanding Attack Surface Provides a Blueprint for Exploitation

The deeper issue can frequently lie in how enterprises view cybersecurity, especially when it comes to tools adopted outside traditional IT oversight. AI-driven tools are increasingly being implemented by line-of-business teams: HR, marketing, logistics. They’re seen as software as a service, quick to install, easy to use, and rarely scrutinized. The belief that “someone else” is handling security is pervasive.

PYMNTS reported in September that while businesses have traditionally focused on internal cybersecurity measures, today’s interconnected digital ecosystem demands a more holistic approach.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

Days after declaring victory in his administration’s push to cut regulatory red tape by 25%, Gov. Glenn Youngkin is now looking to artificial intelligence to help push that number even higher.

In an executive order issued Friday, Youngkin announced Virginia will launch the nation’s first “agentic AI” pilot program designed to streamline state regulations and guidance documents. The initiative will scan thousands of pages of agency rules using generative AI to identify redundancies, contradictions and overly complex language — all in the name of efficiency.

“We have made tremendous strides towards streamlining regulations and the regulatory process in the commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Using emergent artificial intelligence tools, we will push this effort further in order to continue our mission of unleashing Virginia’s economy in a way that benefits all of its citizens.”

The move builds on the administration’s broader deregulation campaign, which this week marked a milestone by surpassing a 25% reduction in regulatory requirements across state government six months ahead of schedule. It’s unclear exactly which regulations have been shaved off, and Youngkin’s press officer hasn’t responded to questions about the methodology powering the process.

“The 25% was broken through, and I’m convinced we can get to 35,” Youngkin said Tuesday at an event in Richmond. “It’s about setting targets and hitting them — and then blowing through them and doing even more.”

The new AI pilot, officials say, is a first-of-its-kind effort at the state level. The technology will comb through existing regulations and guidance documents to flag conflicting language, suggest clearer phrasing, and help agencies that haven’t already met or exceeded the 25% reduction benchmark hit the mark. The administration says the tool will also empower agencies to conduct future reviews with greater ease.

“The ‘Virginia model’ for regulatory modernization has become the gold standard across the U.S., with other states and federal agencies looking to replicate our reforms,” said Reeve Bull, director of the Office of Regulatory Management.

A Youngkin spokesman told The Mercury on Friday that artificial intelligence has not played a role in reaching the initial 25% cut. But officials say the new pilot will “supercharge” the process — especially for agencies still struggling to hit the original target.

As of this week, Virginia agencies had eliminated 47.9% of the words in their guidance documents and streamlined 26.8% of the regulatory requirements on the books, the administration said in a news release, emphasizing that most agencies are on track to meet or exceed the 25% goal, while a handful may need an extra push — potentially from AI.

“The Office of Transformation continues to look for ways to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our state government,” said Chief Transformation Officer Rob Ward. “We look forward to working with our Office of Regulatory Management to apply the power of AI to our regulatory environment.”

Youngkin has tied the regulatory rollback to what he views as broader economic success in Virginia. At Tuesday’s event inside a sweltering Southside Richmond warehouse, he rattled off investment and job creation numbers alongside regulatory cuts — $120 billion in new business commitments, 270,000 new jobs, and 15,000 high-growth startups.

“Today is about results,” he told supporters and business leaders. “Today is about commitments kept. Today is about promises made — and a team of extraordinary individuals working together to keep those promises.”

The reform effort stems from Executive Order 19, signed in 2022, which launched a sweeping, government-wide audit of regulations, permitting practices, and guidance documents. That process has resulted in the streamlining or repeal of nearly 89,000 individual requirements, officials said.

Among the most visible impacts are regulatory timelines at the Department of Environmental Quality that have reportedly dropped by 65%, while the Virginia Department of Transportation has cut 20,000 regulatory items.

In housing, Youngkin said updated building code rules reduced the cost of constructing a new home by nearly 6%, saving homebuyers roughly $24,000. Brian Horn, at the time director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, led the charge on that front, streamlining more than 48,000 housing-related regulations.

Environmental regulations were also a target. Andrew Wheeler, former EPA chief under President Donald Trump and now a key architect of Virginia’s regulatory review system, said his office found that more than half of all regulations had been drafted by agencies without external review. He highlighted stormwater regulations as one area where the volume of rules was drastically reduced — from 23 inches of printed materials to just five.

Still, Youngkin has emphasized that the effort wasn’t about cutting corners. “We’re not saying all regs are bad,” he said. “What we’re saying is excess regulation is bad.”

To track agency progress, Youngkin told reporters that the administration has been using a color-coded dashboard — green for those ahead of schedule, yellow for those close behind, and red for laggards.

And as Virginia eyes a new 35% reduction target, the AI pilot is expected to help maintain momentum across the board, the administration said.

Federal funding to Planned Parenthood facilities in Virginia and across the nation are tied up in legal battles for the time being. A provision in Congress’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump last week would block Medicaid payments for services at facilities like Planned Parenthood for up to a year.

Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration over the provision on Monday and a district court judge granted the organization a two-week restraining order against the federal government. On Friday, the Department of Justice called the judge’s order unlawful and asked for it to be withdrawn, saying the judge “didn’t follow procedure and should have given the government’s lawyers time to respond before ruling,” States Newsroom reported.

Judge’s order blocking Planned Parenthood funding ban unlawful, Trump DOJ says

In the commonwealth, about 700 to 800 patients per month use Medicaid to pay for services, said RaeAnn Pickett, communications director for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. The organization’s clinics serve around 25,000 patients overall per year at its facilities around the state, she said.

The next set of arguments in Planned Parenthood’s case will occur on July 21 and determine whether a longer pause will be granted. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported that some clinics in the country have posted notices on their websites alerting patients they can no longer accept Medicaid in order to comply with the law.

While the national organization has drawn ire from anti-abortion advocates and many Republicans over the years for ending pregnancies, that is just one of the health care services the group provides. Planned Parenthood clinics around the nation also offer cancer screenings, sexual health testing, contraception and breast exams.

The most recent data from 2023, Pickett said, shows that Virginia’s centers provided contraception to over 12,000 patients, conducted more than 12,000 sexually transmitted disease tests, performed nearly 1,300 breast exams and performed 705 cervical cancer screenings (which yielded 53 abnormal results, prompting patients to seek follow-up care).

“Every cancer that goes undetected, every STI that goes untreated, every patient who can’t get birth control or abortion care when they need it — all of it is on their hands,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia director Jamie Lockart said in a statement as Congress was passing the reconciliation bill.

Federal law has long prohibited Medicaid coverage from funding abortions, save for specific circumstances. The organization emphasizes that targeting Medicaid funding being used in its facilities will actually affect other components of reproductive health care that low-income families rely on.

“The Defund Provision is a naked attempt to leverage the government’s spending power to attack and penalize Planned Parenthood and impermissibly single it out for unfavorable treatment,” the organization said in the filing.

Earlier this year, three Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia were affected by the Trump administration’s freeze on Title X funding — a decades-old federal program that helps extremely low income families access family planning care at little to no cost. That equaled about 11,000 Virginia patients who were subject to higher costs for care.

In states like Virginia without tight restrictions or bans on abortion, organizations like Planned Parenthood have been a critical access point for travelers seeking abortions.

Pickett said that close to 30% of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood are from out-of-state patients — meaning that about 3,000 people are traveling for care. Overall abortion providers in Virginia have reported a rise in out-of-state patients in recent years, as surrounding states have enacted restrictions or near-total bans on the procedure.

The “big beautiful bill” was passed by both chambers of Congress and last week, President Donald Trump signed it into law, triggering a countdown until sweeping changes to Medicaid take effect, including potential coverage loss for millions nationwide, financial strain to hospitals and new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. While the changes won’t kick in for more than a year, Virginia lawmakers are already preparing for the transformation of the state’s health care landscape.

It’s still unclear exactly how many Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage because final analyses from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) haven’t dropped yet. The uncertainty has left many wondering if they or loved ones will be impacted — and set the stage for partisan bickering.

Democrats have warned for weeks that over 322,000 Virginians could lose health insurance, based on a state-by-state breakdown from the U.S. Senate’s Joint Economic Committee and previous CBO estimates released as the bill made its way through Congress.

What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday that figure is “literally made up,” while other Republicans have pointed to a 7-year-old state study, conducted before Virginia expanded its Medicaid program in 2018, to claim far fewer would be booted from Medicaid.

Clearer understandings of just what will happen to Medicaid in Virginia and other states may be best found in future OMB reports but its most recent estimates found 10.8 million Americans nationwide could lose insurance as a result of the bill.

‘A moving target’

The bill’s rapid race over the finish line, from the House to the Senate to Trump’s desk in a span of mere weeks, could be the root of confusion about its full impact concerning health care, and lawmakers’ differing interpretations. Analysts and organizations tracking the legislation also tried to keep pace.

While the CBO was able to do further analysis on the House version of the bill earlier in the summer, the shortened timeline for the Senate version before passage, paired with a federal holiday has contributed to a lack of final analysis.

Freddy Mejia, a policy director with The Commonwealth Institute, noted the whiplash lawmakers and analysts experienced trying to keep track of the House and Senate versions of the OBBB.

The impact between the two different bills is “kind of a bit of a moving target,” he said.

He plans to keep an eye out for further reports from CBO now that OBBB has fully passed.

On a national scale, Democrats have stressed that the number of Americans facing the loss of their Medicaid coverage could be close to 17 million. This, a CBO spokesperson said, is because the office created another analysis with provisions that weren’t in the bill that passed, but which could also have an effect: expiration of ACA premium tax credits and a proposed Health and Human Services rule for marketplaces.

Beyond just health insurance, CBO estimated that in general, resources would decrease for lower-income households while increasing for middle class and higher-income households. That supposition, however, stems from the House version of the bill, supported by Virginia Republican U.S. Reps. Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland, which did not become law. Fresh CBO review could reveal how people in different income brackets will fare with the new law overall.

Old data, new frustrations

State Republicans’ allegations that Democrats’ Medicaid coverage loss estimations were inflated first circulated as the big beautiful bill wound through congress. This week, the debate came to a head with Youngkin accusing Democrats of “extreme assumptions” at an event announcing a slate of regulatory reductions on Tuesday.

“The number that Democrats are throwing around on Virginians who will lose their health coverage is made up,” Youngkin said Tuesday while talking with the media at the event. “They choose extreme assumptions in every measure.”

It’s unclear what data Youngkin is using to refute Virginia Democrats’ Medicaid loss estimates and members of his staff did not respond when asked.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Virginia’s House of Delegates have cited n a 2018 study from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). Garren Shipley, a communications staffer for the House Republican Caucus, shared the study with emphasis that the party doesn’t believe mass disenrollment would happen because of Congress’ bill.

Like CBO, JLARC is a nonpartisan research entity in state government that lawmakers often tap to study various issues. The 2018 JLARC study Shipley referenced came the same year Virginia expanded its Medicaid program.

At the time, JLARC estimated that about 32% of Virginia’s Medicaid expansion population would be subject to work requirements and 7% would be deterred from enrolling or leaving the program due to the requirements.

As the JLARC study is over seven years old, it’s likely some of its estimations are no longer relevant or accurate. What is certain, however, is that changes to Medicaid requirements and hospital funding mechanisms are on the horizon.

Work requirements, risk to hospitals

Youngkin also framed the work requirements as an important part of Medicaid reform. It’s something state lawmakers had initially considered when expanding the program seven years ago. The new law will require those receiving Medicaid benefits to maintain full-time employment subject to twice-yearly verification, which some lawmakers and advocates say are either unnecessary because many recipients already work, or needlessly burdensome to those living with a disability.

“Redetermination is a really important process,” he said. “It asks us to redetermine every six months, and that gives us a chance to assess who’s gotten a job, (and) who hasn’t complied with the work requirements.”

Youngkin emphasized how Medicaid is supposed to ensure that the “deeply impoverished,” mothers, and children have health insurance rather than able-bodied people “who can get a job and have simply chosen not to.”

Most Medicaid recipients do work, though some like Richmond-area resident Andrew Daughtry, currently do not. A construction worker, he’s tapped into Medicaid for surgeries to recover from an injury that’s left him temporarily unable to work. Earlier this summer he said that it felt “insulting” to have his work ethic questioned.

The twice-yearly employment verification is meant to kick people off their insurance if they aren’t able to keep their jobs while the phase-down of Medicaid provider taxes and state-directed payments are also meant to curb costs for the federal government.

But hospitals warn of heightened chances for closures — particularly in rural areas —- or trimming of offered services and staff. Several hospitals in Southwest and South Side Virginia had already closed obstetrics units, for example, prior to the new congressional bill.

Virginia’s state budget will fund OB-GYN medical residencies amid obstetrics closures

Julian Walker, spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, reflected on the intent of the Affordable Care Act — a hallmark law of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency that allowed states to expand their Medicaid eligibility to provide health care to more people to begin with. The law was about keeping people insured and healthy in order to keep everyone’s bills down.

“The impact is not exclusive to the Medicaid population,” Walker said. “It has ripple effects.”

He noted that uninsured people are likely at or closer to poverty levels than insured people. Without health coverage, they’re more likely to put off preventative care or seek treatment for conditions until emergencies arise.

Walker said people’s conditions are likely to be worse by then — requiring more resources between staff, medications, treatments and length of stay in a hospital. Longer stays mean less available beds for others, regardless of Medicaid status.

Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine, remained vocal on social media throughout the reconciliation process to warn that some hospitals would be strained and likely to close. Sometimes, he tagged Virginia’s congressional Republicans, whose districts include rural hospitals and sizable amounts of Medicaid patients.

Hospitals are also federally required to provide care regardless of whether someone can pay their bills or not, so they absorb that cost while also trying to offset it. As hospitals periodically negotiate with private health insurers, Walker said rates will likely go up for employers and employees with private insurance.

“Different constituencies may feel the impacts differently,” Walker said. “Some more than others — but this has potential to have much more far-reaching implications.”

In the wake of deadly flooding in central Texas and New Mexico that claimed over 100 lives with nearly 200 still missing, scrutiny of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which provides disaster recovery services and funding, has mounted.

Before the floods, the federal government had announced plans to eliminate or remake the agency and is now reviewing its procedures, funding, and execution of agency missions, a process in which Virginia’s governor is taking an active role.

Virginia agencies assist Texas flood recovery, share how state prepares for dangerous weather events

As part of an executive order from President Donald Trump, the FEMA Review Council is analyzing the emergency response agency for potential changes or reductions. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was appointed to the council and now serves on a subcommittee that will report on the roles of localities and other agencies outside of FEMA when it comes to disaster response.

The goal is to create better communication and to put more of the recovery responsibilities on the shoulders of the states.

“We will be receiving inputs from governors, from local leaders, from emergency response personnel, and, of course, from the review council itself,” Youngkin said. “I think we will be able to chart a very clear delineation of the way things work today,” Youngkin added, noting the “deep challenges” of FEMA’s current system and the group’s goal to “shift responsibility to the states and therefore move FEMA from being a supplant role into a support role.”

Traditionally before disasters, FEMA promotes emergency preparedness and provides the National Flood Insurance Program. They also help stage resources in areas where a known storm such as a hurricane is headed towards.

During an event that received a presidential disaster declaration, the agency helps provide recovery centers to disseminate resources as well as funding application locations across the affected areas. The agency works with local and state resources to aid affected communities in the immediate and long-term aftermath of a disaster.

Following Hurricane Helene last year, Virginia was awarded over $18 million from FEMA for individual and household programs. However, low-income families did not often meet the threshold for FEMA funding, leaving them in the lurch when trying to build back their lives. The agency has drawn the ire of Trump and other Republicans, despite some analysts and state officials framing FEMA as a critical resource whose assistance states would likely not be able to replicate on their own.

“Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, FEMA has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,” Trump said in his executive order establishing the review council.

Youngkin said in his statements to the council on Wednesday that during the response to devastating flooding it was unclear what FEMA would provide in addition to other federal agencies.

“How do we move forward with haste in order to meet our citizens’ needs when we don’t really even know how much the resources are going to be to provide the answers to the basic needs of housing, food, and recovery. This is the work that we are undertaking,” Youngkin said.

FEMA has had to deal with a growing number of high-dollar disasters across the country leading to strained services and slower response times. That is on top of reductions in funding from the federal government under the second Trump administration, which have impacted flood resiliency projects, National Weather Service staffing, and other programs in Virginia.

As mandated by the executive order, the council’s final report will include a review of FEMA’s disaster response in the last four years, comparing FEMA’s response to how local and state agencies responded to the same disasters, what programs were in place before FEMA, and how the agency can be more of a support than the main response to disasters.

The order does not explicitly state when a final report is due, and a date wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s meeting, but the council is only ordered to exist for one year.

The newly formed joint commission tasked with overseeing Virginia’s transition to a legal retail cannabis market held its inaugural meeting in Richmond Wednesday, launching what lawmakers described as the next chapter in the commonwealth’s winding path toward a regulated marijuana industry.

Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who sponsored the House resolution creating the commission earlier this year, was elected chair during the meeting at the state Capitol. While no other formal action was taken, the panel laid out its mission and signaled it would use previously vetoed legislation as a foundation to craft a new proposal for 2026 — when Virginia will have a new governor.

“Our goal is to create a successful approach to cannabis that’s rooted in protecting the public, the principles of restorative justice, economic equity and public health,” Krizek said in his opening remarks.

“The need is to regulate, control, and tax marijuana, to generate significant revenue dedicated to community reinvestment, create hundreds of new, small local businesses, strengthen Virginia’s vital agricultural sector, and end the racially disparate impacts of prohibition.”

The commission, which was established through House Joint Resolution 497 without needing the governor’s signature, is set to operate through July 1, 2028. It will serve as a forum for public engagement and legislative planning, aiming to build consensus on cannabis policy amid shifting political dynamics in the state.

Krizek noted that although the effort to legalize retail cannabis has faced repeated setbacks — most notably from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s vetoes — the groundwork is already in place.

“We’ve already been pretty successful,” he said. “We’ve made some big progress, and this will be the final capstone on that progress.”

A blueprint already written

In March, Youngkin vetoed House Bill 2485 — legislation sponsored by Krizek and backed by lawmakers from both parties that would have established the framework for a licensed and taxed cannabis market. The identical Senate version, sponsored by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, passed with bipartisan support as well.

The legislation would have authorized adult-use retail sales starting May 1, 2026, with licenses for cultivation, processing, testing, and retail set to be issued as early as September 2025. It included a microbusiness license tier aimed at lowering entry barriers for historically disadvantaged entrepreneurs and implemented a seed-to-sale tracking system to monitor all commercial activity.

Youngkin’s vetoes take another hit on cannabis reform in Virginia

A projected $87.8 million in annual tax revenue by 2031 was to be allocated across public priorities: 40% for early childhood education, 30% for equity reinvestment, 25% for substance use treatment and 5% for public health.

But Youngkin rejected the measure, saying it would endanger public safety and contribute to negative social outcomes, including “increased gang activity,” impaired road safety, and “adverse effects on children’s and adolescents’ health.” He argued the bill would not eliminate illegal sales or guarantee product safety.

Youngkin also vetoed related bills, including proposals to expunge or reduce sentences for marijuana-related offenses, and a bill to prevent legal cannabis use from being used against parents in child custody cases. Reform advocates decried the vetoes as a continuation of policies that ignore the realities of marijuana use in Virginia.

Legal, but still in the shadows

Virginia made headlines in 2021 as the first Southern state to legalize small-scale possession and home cultivation of cannabis. But despite legalization, no retail infrastructure was ever implemented, leaving the state in a legal limbo. Cannabis remains readily available — just not regulated, tested, or taxed.

“We know that marijuana is being sold in this commonwealth,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who helped legalize personal possession and now sits on the commission. “And thanks to Governor Youngkin’s veto pen, the way it’s being sold is with illegal, un-taxed enterprises outside of the medical program.”

Ebbin urged fellow commission members to keep the big picture in mind.

“My goal is to move sales away from the illegal market on the street corner to behind an age-verified counter with tested products, and I think that’s a goal that most of the members of this commission share,” he said.

Voices from the public

During Wednesday’s meeting, advocates, growers, wellness professionals, and business leaders addressed the commission in a public comment session that highlighted the wide-ranging hopes — and frustrations — of those awaiting a regulated market.

Chelsea Higgs Wise, founder of Marijuana Justice, praised the commission for opening a space for dialogue but urged members to stay grounded in the equity framework laid out in the state’s original adult-use blueprint.

“The 2020 JLARC report was key to be lifted,” she said, referring to the legislative audit report that called for an equitable cannabis market.

“From the public comments, it appears Virginians are unified on wanting broad inclusion within the market versus only benefiting a well-resourced few. There is still much work to be done and we are confident the commission will take this seriously,” she added.

Jason Blanchette, president of the Virginia Cannabis Association, pointed out that the core elements of the legislation have already passed twice — just not survived Youngkin’s vetoes.

“So obviously our hope in representing small Virginia businesses and small farmers … is that we can all come to an agreement at some point here, right?” he said.

That hope was echoed by Thelonius Cook, a farmer on the Eastern Shore and president of the Mid-Atlantic Black Farmers Caucus.

“I’m here to represent the voice of small farmers, and in particular, Black farmers,” Cook said. “Had it not been for the enslaved labor of Africans producing tobacco and the plantations of Virginia, this colony would have not survived, let alone went on to become America. We want to make sure we have an opportunity to participate in this agricultural revolution.”

Jabria Craft, a cannabis wellness coach from Richmond, spoke passionately about moving beyond product hype and fear-based regulation.

“My platform is rooted in helping people build sustainable and informed relationships with this plant,” she said. “Education is either nonexistent or filled with shame at risks, instead of benefits and support. I would like to see Virginia cannabis as an industry that’s centered in education, intention, and equity… and that us Black and brown and queer folks aren’t left behind on a system that was built on their backs.”

A policy puzzle with political stakes

While Democrats are banking on winning back the governor’s mansion in November — with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger as their nominee — the cannabis debate remains far from settled. The commission’s task now is to rework and refine the blueprint for legislation that can be enacted under new leadership.

Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, a local prosecutor and one of two House Republicans who supported Krizek’s retail bill earlier this year, has publicly advocated for a pragmatic approach to cannabis reform.

“I have been an advocate for common-sense legislation to regulate the adult cannabis market in Virginia,” Obenshain told The Mercury in March.

“I’ll continue working in a bipartisan fashion until we find the right balance on legislation that can keep Virginians safe while also eliminating the confusing legal regime and proliferation of potentially dangerous products that currently exists.”

Yet Youngkin has remained firm in his opposition. His administration warned that legal cannabis use could harm children, deteriorate mental health outcomes, and worsen public safety — claims many advocates reject as overblown or unfounded.

One of the bills Youngkin vetoed, HB 2555 by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, would have allowed incarcerated individuals with marijuana-related felonies before 2021 to seek sentence modifications. The governor said that could apply to people convicted of more serious drug offenses, including fentanyl trafficking, and impose “undue burdens” on courts and victims.

Another vetoed measure, HB 2613 by Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, aimed to prevent courts from using legal cannabis consumption against parents in custody or visitation decisions.

Youngkin argued the bill could “risk exposing children to harm.”

The road ahead

As the commission begins its work, members say they will focus on listening to the public, gathering expert input and refining a proposal that can finally bring structure to Virginia’s cannabis landscape.

Krizek said public engagement would be a top priority in the first year. “The idea will be to craft the best bill possible to reintroduce next session,” he said. “So you know it’s a priority of mine.”

Though the governor’s mansion has served as a roadblock so far, Democrats hope the upcoming election — and a shift in executive leadership — will provide the opening they need to bring a legal retail cannabis system to fruition.

Until then, the panel has its work cut out for it. It is set to meet next on Aug. 20.

After years of inconsistencies and complaints, Virginia has moved closer to revising its process for reporting issues with special education services, aiming to improve the structure and ensure that families receive the necessary services for their students with disabilities.

The issues with the state’s dispute resolution system — an impartial procedure for parents and schools to resolve disagreements over issues with special education services — have created a divide among parents and public school leaders for at least the past five years.

As federal law states, Virginia is required to provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program. Last year, Virginia recorded over 185,000 students receiving special education services during the 2024-25 school year.

Wendy Little, a parent advocating for her son who is autistic, spoke on Monday to the state’s dispute resolution system advisory group as it reviewed a study with findings about the existing system and recommendations for bettering it. Her son’s story was a key inspiration for the formation of the advisory committee through successful legislation to address the system. She called for an overhaul of the current system to resolve problems special needs families face concerning their children’s education.

“There is no resolution,” Little said. “It’s a dispute to the parents and you get nowhere. It’s not only broken, it is completely corrupt.”

A history of noncompliance

The system, which has been studied for the past five years, has been criticized by parents and advocacy groups for failing to monitor and respond to complaints raised by families. The situation reached a critical point when the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) was investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which looked into why the agency had failed to resolve complaints.

“The time for continued study should end, and focus should turn to implementing the many reforms that have been offered throughout the years, and in this study,” said Deusdedi Merced, managing member for Special Education Solutions, LLC, which conducted the July 1 study. “The time to address the concerns of many is now. Only then will the full breadth of the protections afforded to students with disabilities on the (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) will be realized.”

The report’s findings highlighted that dispute hearing officers did not meet standard legal practices. It also noted a public perception that VDOE has not effectively enforced the outcomes of investigations related to state complaint orders.

The findings align with a 2020 study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), which analyzes and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, regarding K-12 Special Education.

In that report, researchers identified significant shortcomings in the state’s provision of special education services, including low-quality Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) — customized learning plans for student’s disabilities — a lack of knowledge among educators about how to effectively support students with disabilities, and shortfalls in VDOE’s oversight of local divisions.

JLARC’s study also found that the VDOE does not require school divisions to carry out corrective actions that fully and appropriately remedy instances of noncompliance.

The state education agency began turning things around starting with the Board of Education updating Virginia’s regulations on due process on March 28, 2024. Last December, the Office for Civil Rights wrote a letter closing its findings and requirements against VDOE.

Next steps

Some of the draft recommendations the advisory group will be voting on to improve the system include training for all stakeholders compared to a select few, expanding data collection and improving special education mediation.

Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, chair of the Virginia Commission on Youth, said she hopes the draft recommendations will provide more standardization of the IEP process, better training across the system for the mediators and the hearing officers, and increased clarity and support for parents. Favola, along with Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, carried legislation to overhaul special education in 2024.

“We’re trying to bolster the system in a way that makes it more responsive to the parents and ensures a certain amount of quality across the state and I think that’s going to be the message in the report that we go forward with,” Favola said.

But some committee members, including Favola, expressed concern about whether the recommendations could be met, considering the threat to resources and programs posed by federal funding cuts. VDOE Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said the agency will provide details about some of the cost impacts to special education at a future meeting.

The advisory group invited comments from the public, some of whom urged the committee to consider recommending a $10,000 cap on awards for parents, schools and hearing officers to reduce litigation costs. They also recommended better enforcement of federal laws, which includes the potential loss of licenses for non-compliance, and consistency across all divisions.

Kandise Lucas, an academic civil rights advocate, and parents also raised concerns about the mistrust the public has in Virginia’s public schools due to inconsistent eligibility determinations for students with disabilities and inadequate training across divisions.

“IDEA is a civil rights law that was created to make sure that children with disabilities are not marginalized; are not thrown away,” Lucas said.

The advisory committee’s draft recommendations will be presented to the Virginia Commission on Youth on Sept. 3, and will be open for public comment until October 15. The commission will vote on these recommendations during its meeting on Oct. 21.

TD Cowen analysts say food-industry megamergers haven't worked

With Kraft Heinz Co. reportedly considering a breakup of its business, some analysts believe more of its food-industry peers should do the same.

TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow, in a research note on Monday, said the company's (KHC) potential split underscores his view that megamergers in the food industry often haven't worked out. He added that companies that focused more deeply on specific products did better than those aiming for a wider range of offerings.

""The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable and snacks) tend to differ,"" he wrote.

Moskow added: ""We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey (HSY)) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.""

Moskow made the remarks after the Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that Kraft Heinz was planning to spin off a big portion of its grocery segment, including many Kraft items. Another company would oversee sauces and spreads, the Journal said.

In response, Kraft Heinz - which sells Kraft Mac & Cheese, Heinz Ketchup, Oscar Mayer meats, Philadelphia Cream Cheese and other products - said it has ""been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,"" but didn't comment further. Shares were up more than 2% on Monday.

Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015, in a deal coordinated by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) (BRK.B) and private-equity firm 3G Capital Partners. But the combined company has since faced competition, including from higher-end brands, as well as the rising popularity of options geared toward health-conscious consumers. Meanwhile, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have also reshaped how some people think about their diets.

Moskow, in a note from April, said that the big food companies whose products line most grocery-store shelves raised their prices too much through the pandemic, while sacrificing quality and opportunities to offer more ""premium"" fare.

In Monday's note, he called out other companies that might be better off separating or otherwise shuffling around the brands they already own. He said he would rather see more of that reshuffling than mergers to rein in costs.

""PepsiCo (PEP) and Campbell's (CPB) strike us as the companies with the best opportunity to create value by splitting up,"" he wrote. ""Utz Brands (UTZ) would be a good combination with Campbell's Snacks, in our opinion. Clorox's (CLX) Hidden Valley Ranch brand belongs in the hands of a food company, not a bleach company from our perspective.""

""Conagra (CAG) and General Mills (GIS) both need to continue to shed brands, in our view,"" he added. ""Perhaps there is more news to come on these fronts.""

Elsewhere in the food industry, privately owned Mars Inc. wants to buy Kellanova (K), which owns snack foods like Cheez-Its, Pringles and Pop Tarts. In 2023, Kellanova, which was formerly known as Kellogg, broke off its North American cereal business into WK Kellogg Co. (KLG) This month, WK Kellogg - which makes Corn Flakes and Froot Loops - agreed to be acquired by Ferrero, which makes Ferrero Rocher candies and Nutella.

CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram on Monday also said more food companies could follow in Kraft Heinz's path, assuming a separation occurs.

""Given ongoing sales softness and lackluster equity valuations across the industry, more packaged-food companies may pursue similar strategies to accelerate value creation, especially given limited visibility into when volume sales will return to growth,"" he said.

""While high prices remain a key factor behind the ongoing volume softness, other forces may be at play as well, including the impact of weight-loss drugs (e.g., GLP-1s) and a broader consumer shift toward healthier food choices,"" he continued.

ID31,Polaris,2025-07-14 18:48:07+00:00,Chicago Tribune,This Minnesota recycled aluminum plant will help stem tariff costs - Chicago Tribune,Star Tribune,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/14/minnesota-recycled-aluminum/,"ROSEMOUNT, Minnesota — With its new $71 million expansion, EGA Spectro Alloys in this southern suburb of the Twin Cities becomes one of only about 40 plants in the U.S. that can make recycled aluminum billets.
We are in a really good position,” said EGA Spectro Alloys President Luke Palen.
“With this expansion, we will make 120 million pounds a year of high-quality, recycled billet,” said Palen, who said it also helps companies meet environmental goals.
With the new billet plant, Minnesota will no longer have to send all of its curbside-collected aluminum-can scrap to other states for processing.
Some of Spectro’s billet alloy recipes will allow for some old cans, in addition to the usual industrial aluminum scrap.","ROSEMOUNT, Minnesota — With its new $71 million expansion, EGA Spectro Alloys in this southern suburb of the Twin Cities becomes one of only about 40 plants in the U.S. that can make recycled aluminum billets.

Think 25-foot-long poles of solid aluminum.

The 90,000-square-foot plant gives companies a needed domestic source for the much-in-demand billets at a time when most aluminum in the U.S. is imported and faces a 50% tariff set in June by President Donald Trump.

At the same time, it becomes a much bigger buyer of industrial metal scrap, a new buyer in Minnesota for recycled beer and pop cans and gives Spectro Alloys its first new product line in 53 years.

“So there’s a lot of demand. We are in a really good position,” said EGA Spectro Alloys President Luke Palen.

Because aluminum is used in everything from cars and fighter jets to food containers and America’s ever-expanding energy grid, U.S. demand “approached near record levels in 2024,” said Aluminum Association spokesperson Katie Rosebrook.

Spectro Alloy employs about 150 workers in its original aluminum recycling plant, which makes 28-pound bricks, called ingots, that eventually become parts for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Polaris ATVs and products made by companies like General Motors, Tesla, Black & Decker and Caterpillar.

The company, which is majority owned by Emirates Global Aluminum in the United Arab Emirates, now is scrambling to add 50 new workers and expects the new billet operation to boost business by 50%, Palen said.

“Their investment (of) $71 million and creating 50 new jobs for the area is a huge impact for us,” said Adam Kienberger, community development director for Rosemount.

The first molten metal recently glided from one new three-story furnace, oozed down chutes and spilled into 26-foot casting cylinders, deep in the floor of the expansion.

Three new rumbling furnaces came from Austria.

Once they had cooled, crane operator Lorenzo Martinez gingerly hoisted 10 billets from the “vertical casting pit” and onto a giant conveyor belt. The load weighed nearly 18,000 pounds.

The billets will be marketed under the RevivAL brand name, a nod to the fact the aluminum came from 250 recyclers.

“With this expansion, we will make 120 million pounds a year of high-quality, recycled billet,” said Palen, who said it also helps companies meet environmental goals. “It will … contribute to a circular economy in our region and throughout the U.S.”

Customers are already lined up for the billets, which will be used to build door frames, stair railings and boat docks besides auto parts and more.

Last week, the first truck load shipped to Crown Extrusions in Chaska, which is working with a dock maker.

The company plans to add more equipment so it can produce other products such as sheet metal alloys.

Since selling 80% of the company to EGA last year, the Palens have sent engineers, technicians, chemists and metallurgists to Abu Dhabi for billet training.

With the new billet plant, Minnesota will no longer have to send all of its curbside-collected aluminum-can scrap to other states for processing. Some of Spectro’s billet alloy recipes will allow for some old cans, in addition to the usual industrial aluminum scrap.

“This is exciting, because it’s not only going to increase the aluminum that’s recycled overall, but it’s the first local outlet for aluminum cans in Minnesota, at least that I’m aware of,” said Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) spokesman Mark Rust. “It is critically important that people understand there’s a reason to recycle. These products really do have value. The more material that enters the market, that adds value to Minnesota’s economy.”

Gwen Jenkins, MPCA’s recycling and organics specialist, said she hopes Spectro’s ability to use additional types of aluminum scrap will remind and encourage Minnesotans to recycle more.

Right now, Minnesotans recycle just 51% of aluminum beverage cans or about 14,000 tons a year, she said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CTC-Z-Minnesota-recycled-aluminum-01.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-07-14 16:09:21.917397

The plastic fragments are clear, up to an inch in size, and may have sharp edges, making them a dangerous choking hazard. No flavor or size of YoCrunch yogurt is safe to eat right now.

YoCrunch Yogurt Recall

Product Name: YoCrunch Yogurt (Various Flavors)

Date of Recall: July 11, 2025

Cause: Plastic found in the yogurt mix-ins

What Yogurt Is Part of This Recall?

Danone hasn't said when the contaminated YoCrunch yogurts started appearing in stores. However, its list of affected products includes yogurts with expiration dates from July through September. That means any YoCrunch yogurt that's currently on the market is affected by this recall.

The list of flavors includes popular yogurt options like:

Yo Crunch Vanilla Yogurt with M&M's

YoCrunch Strawberry Yogurt with Granola

YoCrunch Vanilla Yogurt with Oreo Pieces

YoCrunch Vanilla Yogurt with Snickers Pieces

YoCrunch Vanilla Yogurt with Twix Pieces

YoCrunch Vanilla Yogurt with Cookie Dough

This recall affects all sizes of YoCrunch, too, including:

6-ounce individual cups

4-ounce yogurts in four-packs

6-ounce yogurts in eight-packs

6-ounce yogurts in 18-packs

The company is working with grocery stores and other retailers to remove the contaminated yogurt from shelves. We don't recommend buying YoCrunch until fresh product appears in the dairy case, but Danone has not yet said when that will happen.

For a full list of the recalled products with UPCs and expiration dates, check out the chart in Danone's press release.

What To Do With Recalled Yogurt

Danone urges anyone who bought YoCrunch not to eat the yogurt. Some grocery chains, such as Wegmans, have already notified customers about the recall, saying that the product can be returned to the customer service desk for a full refund. We expect other grocers to offer refunds as well.

If you have any questions about the recall or how to get a refund, contact the YoCrunch Consumer Care Line at 1-877-344-4886, Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/o4BVoBan8BT9EXUqZjxe.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_recipes_854/5a794b9c4af0784d7f18268323baf4ab,N,,2025-07-14 19:04:20.011024

Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services and the soon-to-be extinguished plans cover nearly 5,000 enrollees, as of January of this year.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

A recent study published in Health Affairs Scholar found that payer-operated primary care practices accounted for 4.2% of Medicare primary care services in 2023, up from 0.78% in 2016. Although this payer-provider integration varied significantly by area.

Still, payer-operated practices were the dominant source of primary care in some counties. Overall, 15.1% of the U.S. population lived in counties where payers controlled over 10% of the primary care market by 2023.

Primary care services delivered by payer-operated practices were also especially salient in Medicare Advantage, or MA, at 5.73% nationally, compared to 1.84% in Traditional Medicare.

MA penetration was one of the market characteristics associated with the local level of payer operation of primary care practices, according to the study. In 2022, payers operated 5.5% of the primary care market in counties with above-average MA penetration of over 49% compared to just 1.5% in counties with below-average MA penetration.

The finding suggests that payers are more likely to integrate with primary care practices where MA is more popular, the study's researchers said.

Conversely, payers operated fewer primary care practices in areas where hospital market concentration was high, indicating an unwillingness or constrained ability of payers to own primary care practices in areas with major hospitals.

Payer entry into primary care was also significantly less common in counties with highly concentrated payer markets for employer-sponsored insurance.

Additionally, the study found that Optum, part of UnitedHealth Group, controlled the most primary care services delivered by payer-operated practices.

The study showed that Optum controlled 2.71% of the national primary care market by service volume in 2023. In some counties, though, Optum controlled substantially more of the market, with 10.1% of the U.S. population residing in counties where payers controlled over 10% of the primary care market.

Optum's market concentration was over 40% in several counties, including Snohomish County, Washington, where it was 44.9%, Contra Costa County, California, where it was 40.1% and Clark County, Nevada, where it was 35.8%.

Other payers analyzed in the study included Humana, Aetna-CVS Health, Elevance and Cigna.

This vertical integration of payers and providers could improve care coordination, chronic disease management and value-based care adoption, according to the study's researchers. However, increasing consolidation among payers and primary care providers, in particular, raises serious concerns about competition and access to care, they added.

""One concern is that payer-owned physician practices may be used to optimize risk adjustment coding, increasing government payments to their own MA plans without necessarily improving patient care,"" they explained in the study. ""Vertical integration could also give insurers an advantage over competing health plans by steering patients toward their own services or making it harder for other insurers to contract with their physician groups.""

Consolidation could also lead to higher prices or fewer choices for patients if payer ownership of physician practices leads to less competition in physician markets, they added.

These concerns have prompted regulatory scrutiny, antitrust investigations and increased calls for market transparency. Notably, former UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty testified in front of Congress, receiving criticism about the company's alleged monopolistic activities. Witty reported during the hearing that Optum alone employs about 10,000 physicians, or about 1% of all U.S. physicians, while affiliates employ another 80,000 physicians.",https://www.techtarget.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/Hero Images/healthcare-medical-statistics-stethoscope-adobe.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 15:08:55.333045

“People want to see face-to-face interactions and still people want to see bankers from the different banks,” said banking hub operator Vik Puri.","A new banking hub has been welcomed by queues of customers on its official opening day.

Stone is the third location in Staffordshire to have its own banking hub and the 178th in the country.

The former Betfred site now offers face-to-face staffing to customers of NatWest, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Santander.

“I think it’s absolutely brilliant,” said Barclays customer Elizabeth Evans.

“We haven’t had a branch in Stone for quite a long time now, so we usually have to go to Stafford.

The last branch of a high street bank in Stone closed in 2024.

The canal town has had a temporary banking facility at the Frank Jordan Centre for the past twelve months but numerous customers said they were delighted with the new location.

Julie Johnson was there to bank money collected by the Parent Teacher Association at a local school.

“We thought we had nothing and now we’ve got somewhere where we can do everything,” she said.

“People want to see face-to-face interactions and still people want to see bankers from the different banks,” said banking hub operator Vik Puri.

He said it took a year to get the hub ready to open.

Banks were still important in people's lives, Mr Puri added, saying ""specifically vulnerable people, those who can't drive, those who don't want to go to another town"".

Membership Dynamics: Medicaid membership dropped 135,000 due to post-pandemic eligibility redeterminations, but Medicare Advantage (MA) membership grew 12.4% YoY in Q1 2025.
Final Stance: - Hold ELV if you believe Carelon's expansion and MA growth can offset margin pressures.
Until margin pressures ease or Medicaid membership stabilizes, the stock may underperform peers in this cost-driven healthcare landscape.","The healthcare sector continues to grapple with evolving regulatory pressures, shifting member demographics, and escalating operational costs. Elevance Health (ELV), a major player in health insurance and care delivery, faces a pivotal moment as it reports Q2 2025 earnings on July 17. While revenue growth remains robust, profit margins are under siege from rising benefit costs, digital investments, and Medicaid membership declines. This article dissects whether ELV's valuation holds up amid these headwinds or if investors should pivot to peers like CVS (CVS) or Boston Scientific (BSX), which exhibit stronger beat probabilities.

Revenue Growth: A Closer Look at Sustaining Momentum

Elevance's Q2 2025 revenue is projected to rise 11.4% YoY to $48.13 billion, driven by strategic acquisitions (e.g., CarelonRx) and premium growth in commercial individual plans. The Carelon division, which includes pharmacy and home health services, is a standout performer, with operating income up 14.1% YoY. However, this growth comes at a cost:

Benefit Expenses Surge: The medical cost ratio (benefit expenses/revenue) is expected to hit 88.4%, up from 86.3% in Q2 **2024. This reflects higher utilization of care and inflationary pressures in areas like prescription drugs and home health.

Operational Overhaul Costs: Investments in digital infrastructure and interest expenses are pushing total operational costs up ~11% YoY, compressing margins.

Membership Dynamics: Medicaid membership dropped 135,000 due to post-pandemic eligibility redeterminations, but Medicare Advantage (MA) membership grew 12.4% YoY in Q1 2025.

Margin Pressures: Why the EPS Estimate Faces Headwinds

The consensus EPS estimate of $9.20 (down 9.1% YoY) hinges on managing these costs. Key risks:

- Benefit Ratio Volatility: A 1% increase in the benefit ratio could reduce EPS by ~$0.37, given ELV's scale.

- Health Benefits Segment Slump: Operating income here is projected to fall 12.4% YoY, reflecting Medicaid declines and margin pressures.

- Competitor Outperformance: Peers like CVS (Earnings ESP +2.06%) and BSX (Earnings ESP +0.88%) have stronger beat probabilities, as highlighted by Zacks' metrics.

Medicaid vs. Medicare: Balancing Act or Structural Shift?

While Medicaid membership dipped due to eligibility reviews, Elevance's total medical membership stayed stable at 45.8 million, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage (MA) and ACA plans. The 60% re-enrollment rate among Medicaid-eligible members using digital tools suggests some recovery potential. However, the Medicaid redetermination backlog—expected to take over a year to resolve—could prolong margin strain.

Investors should note that MA growth, though strong, faces its own risks:

- A False Claims Act lawsuit alleges improper broker incentives in MA sales, which, if settled unfavorably, could disrupt enrollment.

- Slower MA industry growth (3.8% in Q1 2025 vs. 6.5% in 2023) may limit Elevance's upside.

Valuation and Investment Takeaway

Elevance's stock trades at a 14.2x forward P/E, slightly below its five-year average of 15.6x. While the company raised full-year EPS guidance to $32.85+, its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00% suggest limited upside surprises. Meanwhile, peers like CVS (Zacks Rank #2) and BSX (Zacks Rank #2) offer better beat odds and faster growth trajectories.

Historically, ELV has shown resilience around earnings releases: from 2022 to present, a buy-and-hold strategy yielded a 71.43% win rate over 10 days, with a maximum return of 1.01% on day 58. This underscores the stock's potential to rebound after near-term volatility.

Final Stance:

- Hold ELV if you believe Carelon's expansion and MA growth can offset margin pressures. The stock's historical performance around earnings events—such as a 57.14% 3-day win rate and 64.29% 30-day win rate—supports this stance.

- Consider pivoting to CVS or BSX for safer upside, given their stronger beat probabilities and less exposure to Medicaid volatility.

Elevance's story remains tied to execution in high-growth segments like CarelonRx and managing the Medicaid redetermination tailwind. Until margin pressures ease or Medicaid membership stabilizes, the stock may underperform peers in this cost-driven healthcare landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:05.262022

But outside of those areas, it’s been more hit or miss for Nike Running in recent years.
Having enjoyed the Vomero 18 himself, he was curious what his friend would think of it.","Nike chief executive officer Elliott Hill told investors in the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 conference call last month that the worst is now over.

Net income and sales both declined again in the period, but based on Nike’s “Win Now” actions over the prior 90 days, Hill said: “From here, we expect our business results to improve. It’s time to turn the page.” Investors agreed, with shares closing with a 15 percent increase the following day.

One spot where the numbers are already showing improvement is in running. Nike Running grew by “high single digits” in Q4, and Hill called out the success of the Vomero 18, which has already grown into a $100 million franchise after launching at the end of February.

Three specialty retailers who spoke with Footwear News all agreed: the Nike Running comeback is very much on.

Chris Farley, owner and president of Pacers Running, said Nike is outpacing all of its other vendors, with a 20 percent growth in sales so far in 2025. With five stores in Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia, Pacers has seen the Vomero 18 become its top-seller.

The story is the same for Philadelphia Runner and Heartbreak Hill Running Company, which has locations in Boston, Chicago and Santa Monica, Calif.

“I really liked the [Vomero 17], but we did not sell very many of them,” said Philadelphia Runner co-owner Ross Martinson. “The new Vomeros are the best-selling Nike right away. The problem has been the men’s (sizes), we haven’t been able to get enough of them. But that’s sort of a good problem.”

The Vomero 18 has come in the early days of a streamlined new era for focused on three franchises: Pegasus, Structure and Vomero. In order, the franchises are targeted toward responsive cushioning, supportive cushioning and maximum cushioning.

Each banner gets three different silhouettes, starting with the numbered baseline model and offering upgrades through the Plus and Premium variants. The Pegasus is the only franchise to see all three of its models come to stores already with the Pegasus 41, Pegasus Plus and Pegasus Premium, the latter of which is Nike’s first sneaker to ever feature a curved, full-length Zoom Air unit.

Nike will follow up the Vomero 18, which uses a combination of ReactX and ZoomX foams, on August 7 with the Vomero Plus, which is boosted by a full ZoomX midsole. The Vomero Premium will then come October 2 with Air Zoom units at the forefoot and heel taking the max-cushioned proposition to the highest level.

Heartbreak Hill Running Co. co-founder Dan Fitzgerald, who’s also a Nike Running coach, said the Pegasus franchise has always sold well in his stores and credits the Swoosh with creating the super shoe. But outside of those areas, it’s been more hit or miss for Nike Running in recent years.

Anecdotally, Fitzgerald points to a personal friend who logs 10 miles a day and runs in On. Having enjoyed the Vomero 18 himself, he was curious what his friend would think of it. “He put them on and he said, ‘Yeah it feels pretty good.’ Then I hit up a week later and he said: ‘I’m actually blown away. That’s my favorite shoe.”

With only five of the nine sneakers from the Vomero, Pegasus and Structure lines having launched, it’s still too early to tell what effect the relaunch will have on consumers. At the very least, though, the new dividing lines does it make it easier for retailers to explain to customers.

“Our staff really dictate the experience on the floor,” Farley said. “I think [the shoes’ purposes] are more clear. A simpler approach has been much better, so they’re more comfortable bringing out, talking about features, benefits and all those things where they may not have been as clear in the past.”

The new silos serve to replace the Infinity and Invincible, the purposes of which weren’t quite as clear and were easy to conflate with each other because they have “In” as prefixes.

There is still some concern that the difference, for example, between a base and Plus model may not be quite as recognizable. “The Vomero Plus looks awesome too,” Martinson said. “I’m curious to see how that affects sales of he regular Vomero because it’s kind of a different feel, but they still look fairly similar. So we’ll see how that goes.”

As promising as this year’s returns have been for Nike Running, as well as the positivity of its forecast, it does indeed still have ground to make up in the sport.

For runners who may go out just once or twice a week, as well as walkers and broader fitness enthusiasts, Farley said Nike still isn’t winning that conversation. With those consumers, Brooks, Asics and Hoka still reign.

And because the super shoe race has become so crowded, Martinson believes it will be more important than ever for Nike to win over the more casual runners and offer the best shoes that won’t be used on race days. “[Nike has] dominated super shoes and still leads it, but where they were 90 percent of those sales, maybe they’re going to be 50 to 60 [percent] going forward,” he said. “So it feels like good timing for them. It certainly feels like a turnaround for Nike or a vibe shift.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nike-running-comeback-001.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-07-14 15:09:23.547151

Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Brian Niccol is doubling down on his push to return staff to the office.

On Monday, CEO Brian Niccol said in a note to staff that its support partners and people managers will be required to come to the office four days a week starting in late September.

Starbucks is also broadening expectations for which workers need to relocate to either of its North American hubs in Seattle and Toronto. Those workers expected to be in-person in either location will have a year to make the move. The company said it will also offer buyouts to employees who don't plan to meet these expectations as part of this broader mandate.

""We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together,"" CEO Brian Niccol wrote. ""We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.""

In April, the company reported US same-store sales fell for the fifth straight quarter to start 2025, a result Niccol called ""disappointing.""

The company is navigating a major brand overhaul amid an environment in which consumer spending has been under pressure. Niccol joined the company last year in a high-profile move from Chipotle, where he had served as CEO since 2018.

Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a recent note to clients that he's eager to hear more about ""updates on timeline and potential costs related to remodels and progress on menu simplification"" in the company's upcoming quarterly report.

The company disclosed in a filing earlier this month that top executives could earn up to $6 million in stock grants if it meets cost-cutting reduction goals.

""We’re driving significant change across the company while staying true to our core values,"" Niccol wrote Monday.

""We know we’re asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.""

Investment Case: Buy the Resilience, Not the Volatility M&T's Q2 results will likely affirm its ability to navigate a challenging environment through: 1.
In a banking sector buffeted by macro risks, M&T's blend of revenue diversification and operational discipline offers a rare combination of growth and stability.","In an era marked by interest rate uncertainty and sector-wide margin compression, M&T Bank (MTB) has positioned itself as a standout performer through its diversified revenue streams and disciplined management. The upcoming Q2 2025 earnings release on July 16 promises to underscore how the bank's focus on net interest income (NII), fee-based diversification, and cost control could solidify its outperformance amid industry volatility. For investors seeking stability in a choppy banking sector, MTB's metrics and execution may offer a compelling entry point.

Diversified Revenue Streams: NII Growth and Fee Income Momentum

M&T's earnings trajectory hinges on two pillars: its balance sheet management and its non-interest revenue engine. For Q2, sequential NII growth is expected to reach the mid-to-high 3.60% net interest margin (NIM) range, driven by:

- Loan Growth: A modest increase in consumer loans (autos, recreational finance) and commercial & industrial (C&I) lending offsetting declines in commercial real estate (CRE). Full-year loan balances are guided at $135B–$137B, with CRE paydowns now stabilizing.

- Deposit Strength: Strong consumer deposit flows and an extra business day in Q2 are boosting average deposits, which are projected to hit $162B–$164B for 2025. This reduces reliance on costlier wholesale funding and supports margin resilience.

Meanwhile, fee income continues to broaden its reach:

- Trust Services: Q2 trust income is forecast to rise 6.6% year-over-year to $181M, benefiting from wealth management demand.

- Mortgage Banking: Residential subservicing and potential rate-driven origination activity could push mortgage revenue to $127M, up 20% from Q2 2024.

- Diversification: Non-interest income now accounts for 26% of total revenue, with service charges, fund banking, and corporate institutional services all contributing. Full-year fee income is poised to hit the high end of its $2.5B–$2.6B guidance.

Margin Resilience Through Prudent Management

While peers grapple with margin contraction, M&T's strategy to prioritize low-cost deposits and optimize its balance sheet has insulated its NIM. The bank's 65% non-interest-bearing deposit mix and disciplined liability repricing have kept funding costs low, even as CRE loan volumes declined. Management's focus on remixing the loan portfolio—shifting toward higher-yielding C&I and consumer loans—adds further tailwinds.

Importantly, M&T's CET1 ratio is expected to dip to 11% by year-end (from 11.5% in Q1), but this reflects strategic capital allocation: $662M in Q1 share repurchases and a 2.7% Stress Capital Buffer reduction signal confidence in liquidity and risk management. This contrasts with competitors forced to conserve capital amid macroeconomic jitters.

Cost Discipline and Efficiency Gains

Cost management is the third pillar of M&T's resilience. Sequential expense declines in Q2 are projected due to seasonal compensation reductions (e.g., lower stock-based payouts). Full-year non-interest expenses are guided at $5.4B–$5.5B, a 2% year-over-year increase that trails revenue growth. The efficiency ratio is expected to stabilize around 56%, a marked improvement from Q1's elevated 60.5%—a byproduct of one-time items and seasonal spikes.

This discipline contrasts with sector peers, many of whom face rising operational costs from digital transformation investments or compliance headwinds. M&T's focus on simplification and selective tech spending (e.g., enhancing its deposit franchise) avoids overextending its cost base.

Zacks Rank and Dividend Discipline: A Buy Signal?

Despite its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), M&T's stock has outperformed the broader market, rising 27% YTD versus the S&P 500's 10%. The Hold rating reflects near-term sector uncertainty but overlooks MTB's structural strengths.

Investors should note:

- Dividend Track Record: The $1.35 quarterly dividend (yield ~2.7%) has been raised annually for over two decades, signaling capital return discipline.

- Valuation: At current levels, MTB trades at 1.4x tangible book value, a discount to its historical average and to peers like US Bancorp (USB).

Investment Case: Buy the Resilience, Not the Volatility

M&T's Q2 results will likely affirm its ability to navigate a challenging environment through:

1. Margin Stability: NIM expansion in a flattening yield curve environment.

2. Fee Income Diversification: Reducing reliance on rate-sensitive NII.

3. Capital Flexibility: A CET1 ratio that balances growth and safety.

While the Zacks Rank #3 is cautious, it ignores MTB's outperformance and defensive qualities. For investors, the stock's current valuation and dividend make it a compelling buy. Consider accumulating a position ahead of the July 16 earnings release, with a target price of $225–$230 (15x 2025 EPS estimates) and a stop-loss below $200. Historical context supports this strategy: over the past four years, a buy-and-hold approach around MTB's earnings dates achieved a 64.29% win rate in the 3 days following results, though returns moderated to 57.14% over 30 days. The maximum gain reached 1.63%, but periods of negative returns, such as a -0.15% 30-day decline, highlight the need for disciplined risk management.

In a banking sector buffeted by macro risks, M&T's blend of revenue diversification and operational discipline offers a rare combination of growth and stability. The Q2 results could cement its status as a top pick for income-seeking investors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 09:03:44.939924

The measures are a win not only for some 20,000 gig workers, but also for rival delivery apps that had complained they were being singled out unfairly under the existing law.
Council officials told Crain’s that the expansion bills were discussed during settlement talks but were not a formal part of the agreement.
The companies also argue that grocery delivery is a necessity for some low-income New Yorkers, not a luxury item like restaurant food.
Advocates for delivery workers support the bills, which they say will benefit a workforce that includes large numbers of African immigrants.","The City Council on Monday is expected to pass two bills that expand New York’s landmark protections for restaurant delivery workers to cover workers who deliver groceries. The measures are a win not only for some 20,000 gig workers, but also for rival delivery apps that had complained they were being singled out unfairly under the existing law.

The two bills build on the 2021 measures that set a minimum wage for delivery drivers — $21.44 as of April, a figure that will rise with inflation — and also guarantee other protections, including access to bathrooms at the businesses they serve. The legislation closes what the website Streetsblog dubbed the “Instacart loophole,” referring to the major grocery-delivery app, which had been exempt from the laws even as they applied to restaurant apps such as DoorDash, Grubhub and UberEats.

Although those app companies opposed the laws when they first applied to them, they supported the new measures as a way to even the playing field. A DoorDash executive told the council in December that “some platforms are at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to their peers, and workers are caught in the middle, left to navigate a regulatory scheme that denies them equal pay for equal work.”

The new minimum-pay expansion “reflects a pragmatic step toward treating all delivery workers consistently, regardless of what they deliver,” said Kassandra Perez-Desir, senior manager of government relations at DoorDash, in a statement on Monday.

Monday’s vote comes a month after the city softened another law that limited the fees that app companies can charge to restaurants. In exchange for that rollback, DoorDash, Grubhub and UberEats agreed to drop two pending lawsuits against the city over the fee cap and the minimum-pay law.

Council officials told Crain’s that the expansion bills were discussed during settlement talks but were not a formal part of the agreement.

Instacart and other grocery apps like Shipt remain opposed to the bills, which they say will increase prices for customers and limit the number of jobs available to gig workers. The companies also argue that grocery delivery is a necessity for some low-income New Yorkers, not a luxury item like restaurant food.

“It’s simply unconscionable that the City Council would pass a bill that would have such devastating consequences for New Yorkers,” said Thomas McNeil, senior manager for government affairs at Instacart, in a statement. “Grocery delivery is a lifeline for thousands of people across the city, especially those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges.”

Mayor Eric Adams has not said whether he will veto the bills, although the council would likely vote to override his rejection. Instacart is widely expected to sue if the measures become law.

Advocates for delivery workers support the bills, which they say will benefit a workforce that includes large numbers of African immigrants.

Brooklyn Councilwoman Sandy Nurse, who sponsored the bill expanding the pay rate, told Crain’s that the complaints of unfairness by the likes of DoorDash and Grubhub were not a significant factor in pushing the bills toward passage.

“Instacart is fighting really hard to stop this legislation, but we did this because any business model that is not able to survive a minimum pay rate is not a successful model,” she said. “We cannot legislate to save individual companies — we have to legislate to protect the workers who are being exploited.”

Regulating delivery apps has been a top priority of city lawmakers since the industry exploded in popularity during the pandemic. The latest legislation also coincides with the apps’ emergence as unexpected political players in the June primary elections: DoorDash spent $1 million to support Andrew Cuomo’s mayoral campaign and spent another $1.2 million on council races, while Uber spent $2.4 million in council contests.",https://s3-prod.crainsnewyork.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/main-%20instacart_i.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:31.165644

But in the case of Starbucks, it’s part of a brilliant promotional strategy by its new chief brand officer Tressie Lieberman.
How will Starbucks’s Secret Menu work?
“[With the Secret Menu] We’re really just working to help put media behind [fans] and get more reach around new ideas.
The only question remaining is, can a secret menu stay cool when it’s available to millions of customers?","Starbucks has been in a bit of a slump, facing stagnant growth as it awaits its new CEO Brian Niccol’s turnaround. His strategy? Nicer stores you want to sit in. Protein-loaded coffee. And now . . . turning every day at Starbucks into a viral drop.

The company is launching a “secret menu” in its app today, building off the momentum of its “not-so-secret menu” broadcast channel on Instagram. Secret menus, of course, are irresistible to the fleshy consumer brain. A mystery and treat in one! But in the case of Starbucks, it’s part of a brilliant promotional strategy by its new chief brand officer Tressie Lieberman.

How will Starbucks’s Secret Menu work?

The menu will contain rotating offers for drinks. But instead of being born inside its Seattle headquarters coffee lab, these drinks are created by fans on social media who use Starbucks’s customization options to create particularly alluring beverages.

“That’s what people do today: create their own Starbucks order,” says Lieberman. “And so how do we tap into that?”

Indeed, customization is a big part of Starbucks’s appeal; you can order a drink just as you like it. But its menu has become so sprawling and complicated for baristas to produce that Niccol has actually cut it back by nearly a third to simplify production.

What’s brilliant about the Starbucks Secret Menu—which is launching with a $25,000 prize to stoke interest—is twofold: Instead of creating a TikTok trend, it can simply ride a TikTok trend, since people are already promoting their own custom drinks on the service. But the second component is just as important for a company with tens of thousands of locations worldwide. These glitzy, viral drinks are being made with the ingredients Starbucks already has lying around. In other words, it’s all turnkey. Starbucks doesn’t need to spin up a whole production supply chain to sell the equivalent of a McRib. It can just rearrange its food stuffs to make something novel, a lot like Taco Bell combines its shells and sauces to make something new—but crowdsourced.

This strategy is a far cry from how Starbucks used to look at viral creations: as operational headaches that were at odds with its own business model. Instead, Starbucks can analyze a viral menu item, decide if it needs to be tweaked for scale, and then share it back with its audience in a way that can work.

“Some of the best ideas are coming from customers. Customers decide what’s in; customers decide what’s cool,” says Lieberman. “[With the Secret Menu] We’re really just working to help put media behind [fans] and get more reach around new ideas. It’s a lot about being visible, visible to our audience, and being really strategic about how we approach these different trends as well,” says Lieberman.

She points to a recent viral drink called the Gummy Shark, where TikTokers took the Summer Berry Refresher and added cold foam so it would taste like the popular candy, as a recent proof point of this strategy.

“That’s a gift from our customers,” says Lieberman. “Let’s jump on that. Let’s create content around it and celebrate it, instead of moving away from it.”

In other words, with its new Secret Menu, Starbucks is building a workflow so that they don’t need to come up with their next hit, while ensuring that you can taste the wild thing you’re gawking at online easily. (Its new point-of-sale terminals will even be getting a viral drinks tab so that if you walk into a store without your phone, you can order off this menu as well.)

The only question remaining is, can a secret menu stay cool when it’s available to millions of customers? Anyone who’s ordered a speak-easy-inspired Neapolitan shake or animal style fries from In-N-Out knows . . . the answer is a sad and true, “absolutely yes.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91365360-starbucks-secret-menu.jpg",N,,2025-07-14 14:13:36.773810

Polaris followed the launch with an internal survey, in which 100% of respondents said they wanted to learn more about women’s health.
This is just one of the examples of how the League can organically respond to women’s real-world concerns.
“I will praise the men at Polaris because of the allyship and the support they’re giving us,” Muir said.
Even now, as the League continues to grow, it has created a stronger sense of community among Polaris employees.","Polaris Transportation Group has officially launched the Polaris Women’s League — an initiative borne from the vision of late highway dispatcher Pam Lambe, who dreamed of creating a safe, inclusive space for women at the company.

The idea was first raised several years ago during one of Polaris’ virtual “hot chocolate hours,” informal social gatherings the company hosted to support employee morale during remote work. This is according to Laura Muir, Polaris’ chief human resources officer, who told trucknews.com that during one such gathering, Lambe suggested having women-only meetings to talk openly about topics like health, home life, and mental wellness.

“She said, ‘How great would it be to have just the women, where we could talk about health and just generally, have a free space to speak?'” Muir said. “She passed some time ago last year, and I wanted to launch this in her memory. She would be so happy.”

Launched on International Women’s Day this March, the League’s inaugural event — a tea party held both in-person and virtually — drew unexpectedly high turnout and overwhelming enthusiasm, she adds. Polaris followed the launch with an internal survey, in which 100% of respondents said they wanted to learn more about women’s health.

Since then, the League has evolved into a dynamic, employee-led initiative offering quarterly formal events and a range of ongoing activities that have branched out since. These include a book club, movie club, a walking group that meets weekly — and sometimes daily — during warmer months. Muir says there was even a discussion about general auto mechanics, sparked after someone asked how to check tire pressure and change a tire.

The conversation came up casually during one tea party, after Muir mentioned she had low air in her tires. Several women said they didn’t know how to check or refill them. That led to plans for Polaris’ driver manager to attend an upcoming session to give a hands-on demonstration of basic auto maintenance.

This is just one of the examples of how the League can organically respond to women’s real-world concerns.

“It’s just really brought us all together,” Muir said. “I’m seeing departments such as our dispatch department, our HR department, you know, we’re all working alongside with people we wouldn’t regularly work with, or chat with. So it’s really nice.”

Topics that have resonated the most with attendees include menopause, mental wellness, work-life balance and navigating family life. Women in the group have swapped meal prep tips, discussed parenting, and shared wellness resources, including information from Polaris’ community partners and benefits providers.

Polaris is also partnering with its benefits broker to host educational sessions on menopause in the workplace this fall.

Enabling the league with company-wide allyship

Muir emphasized that the League’s success wouldn’t be possible without company-wide support — including from male colleagues and leadership. Managers across departments have encouraged participation, and men at the company have even stepped in to cover duties so women can attend.

“I will praise the men at Polaris because of the allyship and the support they’re giving us,” Muir said. “It really does tighten the family of Polaris.”

As Polaris welcomes new hires, Muir hopes the League will serve as a lasting reminder of Lambe’s legacy and a model for fostering genuine connection and support at work.

“Polaris isn’t just the employees…In Pam’s case, her sister was an extension of her. Our whole families become part of this,” she said recalling the times of Lambe’s illness, adding that Muir and the team stayed in close contact with her sister. Even now, as the League continues to grow, it has created a stronger sense of community among Polaris employees. Women are more involved in each other’s lives — checking in when someone is sick, supporting and celebrating each other, Muir said.",https://www.trucknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Polaris_WomensLeague-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:50.997693

Q2 Earnings Whispers for Elevance

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.

ELV has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

What’s Shaping Elevance’s Q2 Results?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product revenues indicates 11.1% growth from the year-ago period’s $5.5 billion. The consensus estimate for premiums indicates an 11.9% increase from the year-ago period. These are likely to have aided revenues in the second quarter.

The consensus mark for Commercial Individual membership implies 5.9% growth from a year ago, while our model estimate indicates a 5.6% increase. However, the consensus estimate for Commercial Fee-based memberships indicates a 0.1% year-over-year decline.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carelon brand’s operating income for the second quarter indicates a 14.1% year-over-year increase. Growth in CarelonRx is primarily expected to have aided the brand. The results are likely to have been supported by the recent buyouts in home health and pharmacy services.

However, its expenses are likely to have remained elevated in the quarter due to substantial investments in digital capabilities and platforms. High benefit expenses, cost of products sold and interest expenses are likely to have affected profit margins, making earnings beat uncertain. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the benefit expense ratio is pegged at 88.4, higher than the year-ago level of 86.3. We expect total expenses to jump nearly 11% year over year in the second quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Health Benefits segment’s operating income for the second quarter indicates a 12.4% year-over-year decrease. Also, declining memberships in Medicaid are likely to have kept second-quarter premium growth in check.

Stocks That Warrant a Look

While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Elevance, here are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:

Boston Scientific Corporation BSX has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 16.1% year-over-year growth. Boston Scientific’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 8.8%.

CVS Health Corporation CVS has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVS Health’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.47. CVS Health’s earnings beat estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 18.1%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Summit Therapeutics’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 60 days with no opposite movement.

Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson is facing legal action in the UK over claims that its talcum powder products contained asbestos and caused cancer in thousands of people.

Law firm KP Law says more than 100,000 people could have developed cancer, including ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer after regularly using the company’s talc products.

“They knew it was dangerous”: Lawyers say company failed to warn public

As early as the 1970s, it is claimed that Johnson & Johnson knew that asbestos contamination in its talc-based products posed a serious cancer risk – but continued selling them in the UK until 2023 without consumer warnings. In 2023, Johnson & Johnson switched to a corn starch-based product despite making this change in the US in 2020.

“This once-trusted corporation knew for decades that asbestos in its talc products was dangerous,” said Tom Longstaff, partner at KP Law and the barrister leading the UK case.

“They did nothing to notify consumers, who are now paying the highest price imaginable for the sake of corporate greed.”

We’ve teamed up with KP Law to raise awareness of this claim. Have you been affected? Read more or start your claim with KP Law now.

Thousands of potential claimants step forward

KP Law is currently representing over 4,000 people who have joined the group action against Johnson & Johnson. The firm has issued a letter before action and is now preparing to file its claim against Johnson & Johnson.

Talcum powder linked to cancer by global health authorities

In July 2024, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified talc as “probably carcinogenic” to humans, including in relation to ovarian cancer.

Who may be affected by asbestos in talcum powder?

People who used talcum powder regularly for five or more years, starting 10 or more years before a cancer diagnosis, may be eligible to join the claim.

This includes people diagnosed with:

Ovarian cancer

Fallopian tube cancer

Primary peritoneal cancer

Mesothelioma (including in men)

“There are thousands of women in the UK with ovarian or related cancers who could be eligible to make a claim against Johnson & Johnson,” said Longstaff.

“Some men also qualify in relation to peritoneal cancer and mesothelioma.”

Claimants speak out: “We all used talc”

Linda Jones, 66, from North Devon, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2023. She used Johnson & Johnson talc from birth until her 20s.

“We all used talc, without exception,” she said. “If there was any suggestion that it could cause harm to babies or women, it should have been taken off the market decades ago.”

Cassandra Wardle, 44, from Derbyshire, was diagnosed in 2022 and shared a similar experience:

“Johnson & Johnson talcum powder was in every home and a trusted brand,” she said. “I want to know why they didn’t change the ingredients when they knew it was dangerous.”

Substantial compensation claims expected

KP Law says potential damages would reach six figures per claimant, especially for those who have experienced major health consequences or loss of life.

In the US, Johnson & Johnson has set aside more than $13 billion (£9.6 billion) to settle similar claims.

Johnson & Johnson denies claims, maintains product safety

In response, a Johnson & Johnson spokesperson said the company has always followed advanced testing protocols and worked transparently with regulators.

“Our findings show no asbestos contamination in Johnson’s Baby Powder or in the talc we used,” the company said.

“We’ve won the majority of US trials either initially or on appeal.”

The company ceased global sales of talc-based powders in 2022, switching to cornstarch-based formulas, and discontinued UK sales of mineral-based talc in 2023.",https://consumervoice.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-859936614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:36.099402

But that head start came with a catch: now, in the second quarter, U.S. PC sales have flattened slightly, dampening the global momentum.
However, despite the flatlining in the US, the global performance remains positive.
PC shipments rose 6.5% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching 68.4 million units according to data from IDC.
After a spike in Q1 shipments, timed to beat potential tariffs, sales in the U.S. have slowed significantly.","Earlier this year, PC vendors rushed to get ahead of what looked like trouble. With import tariffs on the horizon, shipments to the U.S. surged, inventory filled up, and the market posted strong early signs of growth. But that head start came with a catch: now, in the second quarter, U.S. PC sales have flattened slightly, dampening the global momentum.

However, despite the flatlining in the US, the global performance remains positive. PC shipments rose 6.5% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching 68.4 million units according to data from IDC. Demand across Europe, Asia, and other key regions continues to see traction. This was driven by an ageing installed base, combined with the continued rollout of Windows 11.

This international appetite for PCs is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Without it, global numbers would look very different. The U.S. current stagnation is being felt across supply chains and in vendor strategies. After a spike in Q1 shipments, timed to beat potential tariffs, sales in the U.S. have slowed significantly. Not a collapse, but a pause that adds friction to the broader recovery.

Still, the global market is holding firm. Lenovo grew shipments by more than 15% and maintained its position at the top of the market. Apple saw the biggest jump, up over 21% year-over-year, thanks in part to strong MacBook demand. HP posted modest gains, while Dell slipped into negative territory, down 3%. Overall, the performance was respectable, but it’s uneven.

As the second half of the year approaches, the challenge will be sustaining that momentum. The global market is proving it can grow even with headwinds, but the situation in the U.S.—great in Q1, flat in Q2—remains the wild card. If demand there continues to slow or tariffs shift pricing strategies too sharply, it could begin to drag on the broader performance.

That uncertainty is keeping the entire industry on edge. Ryan Reith, IDC’s group vice president for Worldwide Device Trackers, says the current growth feels counterintuitive, but not without explanation. Supply chain players, still cautious from past shocks, are moving to capture demand while they can, but walking a tightrope. Overextending means running the risk of bloated inventories. Holding back could mean missing the moment. If tariffs go into effect as expected, prices are likely to rise, but not uniformly.

For now, global sales are carrying the industry forward. But navigating the next few quarters will require adaptability and a close watch on the market that still sets the pace for much of the world.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1652430871152-0b95b204f8e5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDM5fHxwY3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3NTI1MDIxNDd8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000,N,,2025-07-14 13:33:44.276599

(TRUE:CSE; TREIF:OTCMKTS; 939:FRA), through its subsidiary Rocket Doctor Inc., has launched a new virtual health screening initiative for adults over the age of 60 in collaboration with EngageWell IPA. The program, known as the Healthy Aging Program, is backed by a five-year US$1 million grant from the CVS Health Foundation and aims to improve healthcare access for older adults in New York City.

The program provides no-cost virtual screenings for heart health, cognitive and memory function, and mental health. Board-certified physicians conduct consultations via phone or video and offer follow-up care plans tailored to each patient. Community Health Workers assist with navigation and help participants access necessary local services. Patients on Medicaid can access the service at no cost, while Medicare patients are covered through insurance.

Dr. William Cherniak, Founder and CEO of Rocket Doctor, stated in the press release, ""We're proud to again partner with EngageWell to bring high-quality, proactive care directly into the homes of older adults across New York City."" The pilot aims to reduce barriers related to language, digital literacy, and mobility, and to address healthcare access issues in underserved communities.

The launch follows Treatment.com AI's recent acquisition of Rocket Doctor, finalized earlier this year. Since then, Rocket Doctor has reported significant growth across its operations. In Alberta, Canada, patient volume increased by 112% year-over-year, with 36,779 patients served in the past 12 months. Physician participation also grew from 22 to 70 over the same period, a 218% rise.

Rocket Doctor has also entered into new partnerships, including a virtual care program with Central California Alliance for Health, which serves approximately 450,000 Medi-Cal members, and an initiative with Melanoma Canada to improve follow-up care for high-risk skin cancer patients. In recognition of its clinical innovation, Rocket Doctor was named a Top Clinical Innovator by the American Telemedicine Association and was featured at events hosted by Harvard Medical School and the AARP AgeTech Accelerator.

The parent company, Treatment.com AI, continues to evolve and integrate its AI-powered diagnostic engine, the Global Library of Medicine (GLM), across medical education, telehealth, and provider platforms. According to the company's July 2025 investor presentation, the GLM currently includes over 10,000 expert medical reviews and is designed to assist with diagnosing more than 1,000 diseases in real time.

Telehealth Sector Faces New Standards and Growing Regulatory Demands

The virtual care and telehealth sector remained in a period of transition during mid-2025, as stakeholders navigated growing regulatory pressures, operational scrutiny, and efforts to redefine ethical practices across the industry.

On April 3, Fierce Healthcare published a retrospective analysis examining how the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped healthcare delivery in the United States. Jesse Ehrenfeld, M.D., immediate past president of the American Medical Association, emphasized that ""you can't have a conversation about the last five years and not talk about telehealth."" He noted a dramatic rise in adoption, with three-quarters of physicians offering telehealth by late 2023, compared to only one-quarter before the pandemic. Fierce Healthcare reported that this expansion improved access to care, especially for mental health services and patients in remote areas, and encouraged broader use of patient portals. However, experts like Patricia McGaffigan of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement advised that adoption must remain measured, stating, ""it's important for us to proceed with a reasonable level of enthusiasm, but also a clear degree of caution.""

The introduction of artificial intelligence tools into telehealth also drew attention. According to Ehrenfeld, ""AI is coming into practice in a way that is really exciting,"" citing a 78% increase in physician usage of health-related AI tools from 2023 to 2024. Yet, regulatory gaps and concerns around responsible implementation continued. Fierce Healthcare noted that general-purpose AI models were sometimes used for clinical decisions, raising questions about patient safety and oversight.

According to a June 12 report from Future Market Insights, the global wireless healthcare asset management market was projected to increase from US$52.06 billion in 2025 to US$155.40 billion by 2035. The report attributed this growth to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and real-time tracking tools within hospitals. These technologies were used to monitor high-value equipment such as infusion pumps and surgical instruments, improve maintenance scheduling, and enhance patient safety through predictive analytics.

The report also noted that cloud-based platforms enabled real-time equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and compliance tracking. It identified a trend toward integrating AI systems with electronic health records (EHRs) and hospital information systems (HIS) to support resource optimization and more informed clinical decisions.

Strategic Positioning in Virtual Care and AI Health Tools

The collaboration with EngageWell and the CVS Health Foundation aligns with Treatment.com AI's broader strategy to merge artificial intelligence with physician-led care models. The company's AI platform has been implemented in university clinical training programs, including the University of Minnesota Medical School, where it enabled OSCE testing of 240 students using AI-simulated patients. The institution estimates that the AI-driven platform could reduce exam costs by approximately 40%.

Rocket Doctor's model combines telehealth infrastructure with physician autonomy, allowing doctors to independently manage virtual clinics. As of July 2025, Rocket Doctor has facilitated care for over 600,000 patients across four Canadian provinces and three U.S. states, supported by a physician network of over 300 professionals.

Revenue generation is driven by a mix of per-appointment fees in the U.S. and Canada, monthly platform fees from physicians, and direct-to-consumer partnerships. According to Treatment's July 2025 presentation, these include pharmacy kiosks and device-enabled care stations used by independent provider associations.

The company has also attracted national attention through accelerator programs at institutions such as UC Berkeley and public recognition through speaking engagements and awards. These developments reinforce Treatment.com AI's role as a key player in expanding access to virtual care for aging and underserved populations through scalable, physician-led, AI-enhanced platforms.

Analyst Identifies Technical Rebound and Operational Strength at AI Healthtech Company

*On May 21, Technical Analyst Clive Maund published an assessment of Treatment.com AI Inc., highlighting what he described as the company's strategic positioning within the evolving artificial intelligence (AI) healthcare landscape.

Maund noted that Treatment.com AI had developed a physician-designed platform intended to address inefficiencies in healthcare by combining clinical intelligence, virtual care capabilities, and voice assistant technology into a unified system. He referred to the company's diagnostic tools — powered by the proprietary Global Library of Medicine (GLM) — as offering continuous availability and AI-driven voice interactivity intended to support clinical workflows.

He also referenced the company's Rocket Doctor subsidiary, describing it as a ""Shopify for physicians"" that allowed practitioners to launch remote clinics and expand access to virtual care. Maund cited the model's scalability as a factor in its relevance to the broader telehealth market.

From a technical standpoint, Maund observed that the company's stock had recently completed what he interpreted as a three-wave A-B-C correction pattern and was rising from a long-term base established over a 30-month period. He identified technical support levels that, in his view, marked a potential inflection point for the stock's movement.

In his analysis, Maund stated that recent volume patterns signaled growing investor interest, describing the accumulation since early 2024 as ""supportive of a significant new uptrend."" He outlined an initial target range of CA$1.08 to CA$1.12, with a secondary target of CA$4.00. Maund concluded that the combination of market positioning and technical indicators suggested, in his opinion, that it was ""an excellent time to buy or add to positions in Treatment.com AI.""

Related: Private investors pumping billions into primary care

Loren Adler, a Brookings Institution researcher, led the team that wrote the article.

The team came up with the figures by analyzing Medicare program data. The authors did not look at figures for physicians who bill commercial health plans, but they likely reflect most primary care physicians in the United States, because Medicare program managers have estimated that 98% of U.S. physicians take Medicare.

The backdrop: A ""vertical integration"" deal involves efforts by one or more vendors to combine with one or more of their suppliers.

Defenders of vertical integration involving health insurers and health care providers have argued that at least some of the deals may improve the cost and quality of care in at least some markets. In 2018, for example, Ken Pokalsky, a vice president with the Business Council of New York State, wrote to the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division to support the CVS acquisition of Aetna. Pokalsky predicted that the deal would help CVS and Aetna hold down premiums, improve preventive care and improve primary care.

But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, suggested in January in a public letter to Elon Musk, who then was overseeing efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to streamline the federal government, that the government should consider breaking up UnitedHealth because of its dominant size and breadth.

The researchers' views: The Adler team did not look in the new paper at the impact of vertical integration on the cost, availability or quality of primary care.

In May 2023, Adler told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee that vertical integration in health care could have both positive and negative effects.

Adler and his colleagues do recommend in the new paper that policymakers and other researchers look into the impact of vertical integration on the primary care market.

Vertical integration could ""give insurers an advantage over competing health plans by steering patients toward their own services or making it harder for other insurers to contract with their physician groups,"" the authors wrote. ""Additionally, payer acquisitions can directly reduce competition in local physician markets, potentially leading to higher prices or less choice for patients.""

The store is located at 6939 Coal Creek Parkway S.E. in Newcastle.

In May, it was announced that CVS would take over many of the Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations that were closing in Washington, according to regulatory filings. The Newcastle location is one of 64 stores CVS is converting across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, according to The Puget Sound Business Journal.

That includes 20 Bartell Drugs locations, marking the end of an era for the local brand.

Rite Aid, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in less than two years, agreed to sell more than 1,000 of its stores to a group of competitors. That group includes Walgreens, Albertsons, Kroger, Giant Eagle, and, for the Pacific Northwest, CVS Pharmacy. The Pennsylvania-based pharmacy chain entered bankruptcy with more than $2 billion in debt.

CVS wants to make the switch smooth for customers, as prescription files have already been transferred and loyalty programs are in place. Some former Bartell employees were kept on through the conversion.

All stores plan to be open by Oct. 1.

Which Rite Aid stores in WA are closing?

Eight Rite Aid stores are closing in Washington across eight different cities.

Anacortes is losing its location at 1517 Commercial Avenue, while Ephrata is losing its store at 250 Basin Street. The other Rite Aid stores affected are in Granite Falls (608 W.

The Ephrata and North Bend locations are Bartell’s pharmacy stores.

Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods.

News of the potentially impeding breakup was reported July 11 by The Wall Street Journal.

Under the plan, several Kraft products would be spun off into a new entity, and the remaining company would produce and market a portfolio focused on condiments and sauces, including the Heinz brand, the Journal said.

Kraft grocery brands include Mac & Cheese, Ore-Ida, Philadelphia cream cheese, Oscar Mayer, Capri Sun, Velveeta, Lunchables and Jell-O.

In response to an inquiry from the publication, a Kraft Heinz spokesperson said: “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

Robert Moskow, an analyst with TD Cowen, wrote at the time the announcement meant some businesses would be divested, adding, “We, too, believe KHC should slim down its portfolio.”

The X Line Grip D tire will be available in sizes 295/75R22.5 and 11R22.5.
“This fantastic leap in drive tire technology brings new levels of performance to the road and new levels of savings for our customers.”","Michelin recently introduced the X Line Grip D tire, which provides exceptional mileage, lasting traction, and features a durable casing designed to reach up to 1 million miles with up to four retreads—all of which assists fleets that are moving goods to consumers across North America.

Recently, Michelin partnered with television host and MythBusters legend Adam Savage and his team, providing an opportunity to witness testing demonstrations on the new X Line Grip D tire and learn about this revolutionary tire on his show Tested.

“We at Michelin are dedicated to evolving tire performance through relentless innovation and ongoing technological advancements,” Pierluigi Cumo, Michelin North America VP of B2B marketing, said in a news release. “That’s why Michelin is proud to introduce the Michelin X Line Grip D tire. This tire has the potential to redefine the drive tire standard in fleets for years to come.

“It is not an evolution to existing products, but something entirely different the fleet world has not seen before.”

The X Line Grip D tire is an example of benefit-focused innovation, and Michelin tire designers characterize this new product as a “once-in-a-lifetime” leap in tire technology for fleets, the company reported. This new SmartWay-verified drive tire helps fleets control their operational costs, providing 20% more mileage and 20% reduction in rolling resistance than the XDN2 tire. Drivers can also remain confident in this 3PMSF-rated drive tire’s excellent traction performance in wet and snowy conditions thanks to the unique chevron tread design. Based on testing of worn tires, the X Line Grip D tire provides more than 90% better snow-starting traction and more than 25% better wet-starting traction than the XDN2 tire. Additionally, fleets can get more out of their assets as the X Line Grip D tire is built on Michelin’s Duracore casing, featuring Infinicoil and Powercoil technologies.

The X Line Grip D tire will be available in sizes 295/75R22.5 and 11R22.5.

That was the focus of Fast Company’s recent New World of Work Summit in partnership with HP, which included a panel discussion on how to lead in this new era, featuring experts from different fields.
Two factors are shaping this new world: hybrid work and AI.
Hybrid work is here to stay, despite return-to-office mandates over the past few years, said Dave Shull, president, HP Solutions.
“IT working hand-in-hand with HR will allow companies to work through AI and hybrid in a very different way,” he said.","We’re in an era of hyperinnovation, full of rapid technological advancements in artificial intelligence and beyond. This environment is creating a new world of work, one that offers both opportunities and challenges. What are business leaders to do in such exciting, volatile times? That was the focus of Fast Company’s recent New World of Work Summit in partnership with HP, which included a panel discussion on how to lead in this new era, featuring experts from different fields. Here are three takeaways from their conversation. (Some comments have been edited for length and clarity; scroll to the bottom to watch the entire panel discussion.)

1. Two factors are shaping this new world: hybrid work and AI.

Hybrid work is here to stay, despite return-to-office mandates over the past few years, said Dave Shull, president, HP Solutions. He cited research from digital collaboration firm Vyopta showing that the number of virtual meetings has not declined, even as in-person meetings more than doubled as people returned to the office. “We thought hybrid was going to go away, and it hasn’t,” Shull said. “That’s a reality and a real challenge that I think we as companies need to address.”

Meanwhile, AI is also changing the face of work in multiple ways. For one, it can help people work cross-functionally and better understand other roles within the business, said Tobias Chen, CEO of Volumetric Camera Systems, which creates immersive video content for film, TV, and other media. He provided an example from the visual effects industry, in which technical backend workers historically had very separate tasks from artists—yet both sides are needed to make projects come to life.

“Now with AI tools, if you’re in a technical role, you can use AI to pre-visualize what those creative graphics could look like,” Chen said. “And those in a creative role can use AI to do those technical steps for you. That cross-pollination helps the whole organization better understand what everyone’s doing.”

AI also enables team members to experiment and iterate with concepts before deciding on the best solution. This iterative process allowed Volumetrics to create a project for The Sphere, an immersive entertainment arena in Las Vegas, in just one month—a deadline that, Chen said, would have been “impossible” otherwise. “Through AI, we’re able to create a lot of concepts and different ideas, then test them out really quickly and iteratively before locking in something and going through the final process.”

“It’s the intersection of those two points—hybrid work and AI—that defines the new world of work,” Shull added. “And the challenge for all of us is to figure out how to solve for our employees.”

2. Tools must foster connection to fuel productivity.

The panelists discussed the tension between engagement and productivity, with some noting that too many tools with too little guidance can undercut the employee experience. If employees do not feel engaged, their productivity will plummet.

Shull noted that technology is now so baked into the employee experience, that the IT function is as critical as the HR function. “IT working hand-in-hand with HR will allow companies to work through AI and hybrid in a very different way,” he said. “IT is key to the employee experience: Are we taking care of that employee experience as the primary metric? And how are we making sure our employees are as impactful as possible, whether they’re at home or in the office?”

As a result, the chief information officer and chief people officer roles are converging, Shull said. He recommended close collaboration between these two leaders and functions, including joint projects like an “early warning system” that flags the beginnings of waning employee engagement.

“There’s going to have to be a reinvention of IT,” Shull said. “It’s being charged in a strategic way like never before: ‘Take AI and transform the company.’ It is now a driving force for growth.”

3. Leaders must trust team members to choose the best way to execute their tasks.

Brian Elliott, the CEO at Work Forward, an advisory group dedicated to helping leaders build better ways of working through data, said the rapid pace of change and emergence of new tools is causing many executives to fall back on “command and control.” Rather than putting more policies in place in order to figure things out, he said they should be asking, “How do I align people around purpose, because that’s what’s going to [engage] them.”

Elliott’s advice is twofold. First, leaders must get their own hands on AI and other new tools if they expect their team members to adopt them. Too often, he pointed out, this isn’t the case. When employees see that their leaders are learning and adapting alongside the rest of the team, it inherently builds trust.

Second, Elliott recommends that leaders ensure they remain focused on business outcomes. Rather than dictate use of a certain tool or process, present it as one tool of an entire arsenal that team members can use to achieve that outcome. Trusting them to execute will engender trust in you as a leader.

“Give them a little bit of latitude instead of command and control,” he said. “Say, ‘Look, these are the big audacious goals we’ve got, but I want you to figure out how we’re going to get there. That’s why I’ve hired you.’ ”

According to HP research, workers who feel confident using AI tools are significantly more likely to report high-quality connections with their colleagues.","In the workplace, as in life, humans crave connection. But how we connect is evolving. Today’s impromptu hallway conversation has been supplanted by video calls, chat threads, shared whiteboards, and AI-enabled platforms that aim to replicate—and even enhance—that sense of spontaneous collaboration.

But when these tools are fragmented or poorly designed, they can do more harm than good. That’s why business leaders must be intentional about how technology bridges physical distances and fosters connection, trust, and creativity.

Recently, a panel of experts discussed how to reimagine workspaces while at Fast Company’s New World of Work Summit, held in partnership with HP. Here are three takeaways from their conversation. (Some comments have been edited for length and clarity; scroll to the bottom to watch the entire panel discussion.)

1. Let people focus on the work, not the tech.

In the future of work, the workplace is no longer a fixed location—it is wherever the work is happening. “The focus will shift from the place where I do my work to the work I am doing and the people I’m collaborating with,” said Helen Sheirbon, svp and chief operating officer, Global HP Solutions.

That collaboration is increasingly virtual. To keep it fluid, technology needs to fade into the background—not get in the way. Sheirbon pointed out that video conferencing tools should work intuitively using AI to handle things like auto-framing the speaker, filtering out background noise, or adjusting lighting so people’s nuanced expressions and gestures can be clearly seen and heard.

“People need to be able to focus on what they’re talking about, not wondering if they look right on camera, or whether their colleague can hear the lawnmower,” Sheirbon said.

2. Design for inclusion—so everyone is seen and heard.

Historically, workplaces have been designed to maximize productivity. But comfort, belonging, and accessibility? Not always considered. That’s changing.

Rani Johnson, chief information officer at Workday, shared how poor lighting during a customer video call left her feeling like just a “set of teeth” on screen. “If I think about my IT team, 52% of whom are in India and many of whom share my complexion—if they’re not feeling seen, that’s a problem,” she said.

Her team took action—experimenting with lighting, conferencing tools, adjusting camera placement, and training employees on how to create a video-friendly space. In some rooms, cameras were positioned too low, creating awkward angles—especially for those wearing dresses or skirts.

They also layered in AI tools to improve accessibility, like real-time transcripts in Zoom for hearing-impaired team members. But tech is just part of the equation. Creating space for every voice to be heard—especially quieter or more introverted team members—requires cultural shifts too.

“I often use this analogy of double Dutch: I’m in a meeting and I’m trying to say something, but I don’t know when to jump in,” Johnson said. “We need to make sure we’re creating environments where everyone feels comfortable to offer their opinions.

“Some of it is tech, but a lot of it is how to facilitate the best environment to get the most out of the creativity that can’t be replaced by AI,” she added. “That’s just innately human.”

3. Demystify AI to unlock its potential.

According to HP research, workers who feel confident using AI tools are significantly more likely to report high-quality connections with their colleagues. But building that proficiency and trust takes more than tools. It takes leadership.

At Workday, Johnson launched a company-wide “Everyday AI” initiative to help employees explore AI through practical training and grassroots support. The company created a network of “AI champions” within departments to model use cases, share results, and answer questions—in some cases leading to three times more adoption of AI in those groups.

“It wasn’t the IT team or the leader coming down and saying, ‘You will do this,’ ” Johnson said. “It’s your teammate showing how it can be used and how to get to true ROI.”

Unlocking the potential of AI needs to happen at the functional level, the panelists agreed. When leaders publicly embrace opportunities to model its use, they create space for others to do so.

“People say all the time, ‘I asked ChatGPT to do this.’ Well, you can also say in a meeting, ‘Shall we get a transcript going?’ or, ‘Sorry I was late, but I’m all caught up because I checked out the AI meeting summary,’ ” Sheirbon said.

This modeling behavior is critical for building trust and normalizing AI adoption, she added. It sends a signal not just of endorsement but of accessibility. “Exploration is part of the process,” she said. “We don’t just want people to adopt AI, we want them to experiment, share, and grow more confident with it.”

Sheirbon added that small, visible actions like sharing how a tool saved time or improved a meeting can trigger curiosity and accelerate learning across teams. “Create that space where it may seem like play, but it’s not—it’s an exploration of what is possible.”

As it's the biggest player in the industry, Forbes writes that analysts and investors often use its results to gauge the sector's overall health.

All eyes will be on the sector after Centene Corp's (NYSE:CNC) withdrawal of its 2025 GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which stems from its initial review of 2025 industry data from Wakely, an independent actuarial firm.

While withdrawing its comprehensive EPS guidance, Centene has reaffirmed its fiscal year 2025 adjusted EPS to be greater than $7.25, aligning with the consensus of $7.23.

UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 outlook in May, citing that care activity continued to accelerate.

Earlier in July, managed healthcare service provider under the Medicaid and Medicare programs, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH), issued preliminary second-quarter results and lowered its full-year 2025 earnings outlook, citing rising medical costs across its Medicaid, Medicare, and state marketplace businesses.

The company expects Q2 adjusted earnings of approximately $5.50 per share—slightly below earlier forecasts—due to expected cost pressures that will persist into the second half of the year.

As a result, Molina cut its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to $21.50 -$22.50, down from at least $24.50 previously. The new forecast reflects a consolidated pre-tax margin just under 4%, at the low end of the company's long-term target.

Forbes adds Centene's announcement is just the latest in a series of updates from health insurers who, over the past two years, have had a hard time managing the costs of people enrolled in government-subsidized health plans.

Price Action: UNH stock is down 1.29% at $300.19 at the last check on Monday.

The CEO and Executive leadership team are essential to executing the company's vision and strategic plan.
How can a board of directors be a table of leaders that set about transformational business change at a business?","Being on a board of directors is more than just a fancy title and compensation package. For many, the opportunity to serve on a board of directors allows them to assist in moving a company into the future, enabling the long-term strategic thought that is needed for guiding high-level executives to perform at their peak capabilities.

Bridget Ryan Berman serves on three boards: Newell Brands, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Asbury Automotive Group. She has extensive executive experience at brands that are household names including Ralph Lauren, Apple (Chief Operating Officer for Retail), Giorgio Armani and Victoria's Secret Direct (Chief Executive Officer).

All that experience has put Berman in the position of offering advice to those who aspire to be in her position one day. She told Newsweek how she got to where she is today and offered advice for those looking to reach new heights in their career.

Newsweek: How did you get into the role of serving on a board?

Berman: ""I appreciate the value of strong working relationships. Most of my board roles have come by way of recommendations from people who I previously worked with, or who served with me as a director on other boards. Personal references can be extremely powerful, particularly when someone has direct knowledge of your skills and understands the advantages you bring to the boardroom.""

What successes drove you to serving on boards? What are your areas of expertise?

""I was fortunate to have held various executive leadership roles in world-class brands and companies during high-growth periods. My experience has been in consumer and retail businesses where the breadth of responsibility is vast, and the ability to have a meaningful impact is significant. Retail is a dynamic industry with constant change and evolution. I felt prepared having led companies and organizations through large scale transformative growth and understood how to work constructively with CEOs and peer directors.""

Why is the leadership of a board of directors important to a company in ways that can complement a traditional corporate leadership hierarchy?

""I believe in strong partnerships between the board and management, and that theirs is a healthy and productive balance of responsibilities. A board is vital to a company's success. Their role is to set the strategic direction, provide oversight and accountability, and ensure that the company manages both its operations and potential risks effectively, while protecting shareholder interests. The CEO and Executive leadership team are essential to executing the company's vision and strategic plan. They oversee the company's goals, and provide the organizational talent, structure, and resources to deliver expected results. Given the speed by which business is changing and industries are evolving, boards are increasingly interested in understanding how technology and innovation can drive growth, enhance efficiency, and influence future strategies.""

How can a board of directors be a table of leaders that set about transformational business change at a business?

""It starts with building consensus amongst the directors about the future of the company. Boards should dedicate the right amount of time in every meeting to talk about strategy and growth. Though it is not the board's role to direct change in the business, they can be highly influential and encourage management to realize the need or potential. Where I have seen it work best is when there is ongoing honest conversation between management and the board about the future vision. The board should be a helpful resource, particularly when individual directors have had experience in large scale transformation and understand the dynamics and the risks. It requires patience and a nuanced style of management from both sides.""

What have you learned during your time on various boards that you implement as a strategy on others?

""Board governance and effectiveness comes to mind. We are dealing with a broadening range of complex issues, and having the right mix of diverse skills and experience on the board is important. I have focused on improving board performance, spending time on the most critical matters, and ensuring there is organizational succession and readiness to address significant issues and opportunities.""

ID13,CVS Health,2025-07-14 15:32:16+00:00,News From The States,Certain Aetna health insurance plans leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/certain-aetna-health-insurance-plans-leaving-affordable-care-act-marketplace-next-year,"Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace.
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include the number of Virginia enrollees covered by the Aetna health insurance plans leaving the ACA marketplace.","Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services and the soon-to-be extinguished plans cover nearly 5,000 enrollees, as of January of this year.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

UHY Hacker Young pointed out that a prevalent strategy used by these firms is known as ‘transfer pricing’.

This involves transactions between subsidiaries, where one entity compensates another for goods and services, including intellectual property rights, potentially leading to reduced taxable income in the UK.

The US government has expressed concerns regarding what it perceives as unfair taxation practices imposed by other countries on American businesses.

The UK’s implementation of a “diverted profit tax” and a digital services tax has previously been identified by the US as examples of such unfair measures.

UHY Hacker Young partner and tax head Phil Kinzett-Evans said: “The amount of tax owed that HMRC suspects that US companies owe is continuing to grow at a scale that HMRC knows it can’t ignore.

“HMRC is under a lot of pressure help fill the shortfall in tax revenues by cracking down on large companies. However, that conflicts with the need to keep the US government onside but not to be seen as too aggressive towards US companies.

“HMRC needs to tread carefully as it faces the challenge of ensuring the UK keeps a good relationship current US administration whilst also investigating US companies for underpaying tax. The less tax collected from US companies, the more has to be paid by other taxpayers.”",https://www.internationalaccountingbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/IAB-3-shutterstock_2499994163-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 13:33:12.804456

In sum – what to know:

SKT goes open source – SK Telecom released AX 3.1 Lite, a mobile-friendly Korean LLM, to an open-source AI hub to promote collaboration and open development.

Built for efficiency – The 7B-parameter model offers strong performance with lower power needs, optimized for mobile deployments and language-heavy apps like call assistants.

Korean LLM expertise – Developed from scratch, the model showcases SKT’s long-term investment in sovereign LLMs and local AI talent, with benchmark scores rivaling much larger models.

Koran carrier SK Telecom (SKT) has taken another step in its AI strategy by releasing AX 3.1 Lite, a compact large language model (LLM) designed for mobile applications, to the open-source AI hub Hugging Face, according to a Korean press report.

The new model, featuring 7 billion parameters, builds on the AX 3.0 Lite previously used in SKT’s A-dot AI call assistant and is part of the telco’s ongoing efforts to optimize LLMs for smartphones.

SK Telecom said AX 3.1 Lite offers Korean language capabilities on par with its larger sibling, AX 4.0 Lite, which has 72 billion parameters. The lightweight version achieved strong benchmark scores — 96% on the Korean language KMMLU2 test and 102% on CLIcK3, which measures cultural understanding, according to the report.

The company emphasized that AX 3.1 Lite was developed from scratch in-house, a continuation of a strategy that began in 2018.

The Korean carrier said the model will enable companies to deploy more efficient, power-conscious AI systems directly on mobile devices, especially where localised language processing is critical.

The model’s release via Hugging Face aims to encourage community feedback and collaboration, the reprot added.

Through its “AI Infrastructure Superhighway” and “AI Pyramid Strategy” initiatives, the Asian telco is investing heavily in AI data centers, cloud-based GPU services and edge computing to support the growing demands of AI applications and services.​

At the core of SK Telecom’s AI ambitions is the development of an “AI Infrastructure Superhighway,” a strategic initiative focused on three main components:​

-AI Data Centers (AIDCs): The carrier is constructing hyperscale AI data centers across South Korea, each designed to exceed 100 megawatts in capacity. These facilities aim to serve as central hubs for AI processing and storage, supporting both domestic and international AI workloads. ​

-GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS): To democratize access to high-performance computing, the company has launched a cloud-based GPU service. This platform allows businesses and developers to utilize powerful GPU resources on-demand, facilitating AI model training and deployment without the need for significant upfront hardware investments. ​

-Edge AI: Recognizing the importance of low-latency processing, the Asian telco is expanding its edge computing capabilities. By integrating AI processing closer to data sources, such as mobile devices and IoT sensors, the company aims to enhance real-time data analysis and decision-making across various applications.

​ SK Telecom previously said it experienced solid revenue growth in its artificial intelligence (AI) businesses, such as AI data centers (AIDC) and AI transformation (AIX), during the first quarter of the year.

In the first quarter, SK Telecom’s AIDC business recorded a 11.1% year-on-year increase, driven by increased data center capacity and utilization rates. AIDC is set to accelerate its push into hyperscale AIDC in the mid to long term, SK Telecom said.

In the AI services domain, the cumulative user base of the ‘A.’ (A-DoT) service surpassed 9 million. Meanwhile, ‘Aster’ (A*), SK Telecom’s global AI agent service, launched open beta testing in the U.S. at the end of March. The service is being continuously refined based on user feedback, with an official release scheduled for the second half of this year.

ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa), which continues to pay heavy prices for government infrastructure and policy failures, may be left with no option but to prepare for the wind down process of its Longs Business, well in advance of September 30, 2025.

This announcement, and despite a forecast of slightly reduced headline earnings losses for the six months to June 30, caused the share price to slump 7.89% to 105 cents on the JSE by Monday afternoon - considering that three years ago the price traded above R5 a share.

On March 31, Amsa announced its decision to wind down the Long Steel Business had been deferred for at least 6 months to September 30 after it received a R1.68 billion funding facility from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC).

The facility was now fully drawn and would enable the Longs Business to operate through the third quarter. The business would also continue to trade until the end of September, having regard to the commitments made to its customers.

However, so far, “limited” progress was made to redress major structural issues, which was the main aim of the deferral period.

“High imports continue to flood into the domestic market. Transnet's rail performance deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk and unaffordable additional costs being borne by the company,” Amsa’s directors said.

The challenges that have faced the group over several years include structural distortions created by the Preferential Pricing System (PPS) and export tax on ferrous scrap in favour of scrap-based steel makers to the disadvantage of integrated steel makers, weak domestic demand, and the lack of growth projects for steel.

There is also insufficient import protection and continued circumvention of tariff protections by local companies, without prosecution.

The rail service performance remained poor with associated, high, globally uncompetitive and unaffordable tariffs. In addition, electricity tariffs were unaffordable and globally uncompetitive, they said.

On two occasions in the past six months, the risk of uncontrolled blast furnace stops arose due to major rail service interruptions, on account of an ""unprecedented spate of cable theft and locomotive failures.""

“Additional unplanned road transport had to be deployed, resulting in higher direct, operational and handling costs of R317 million for the period,” the group's directors said.

Since March, Amsa had been exploring options to address these challenges, while the IDC conducted due diligence into the company, and the government had been pursuing structural interventions, all of which were still ongoing, they said.

“Unless a solution is implemented timeously, and to ensure the orderly closure of the Longs Business as soon as possible after the deferral period, ArcelorMittal South Africa may have no option but to take certain operational steps to prepare for the wind down process well in advance of September 30, 2025.”

Meanwhile, the group predicted that earnings per share would improve 15% to a loss of between R0.82 and R0.93 a share for the six months to June 30, from a loss of R1.09 per share at the same time last year. The full interim results are expected to be released on July 31.

The group said a global cyclical downturn in the steel industry has continued now for almost two years, which is longer than the norm. Global crude steel production fell by 1.3% from January to May 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, according to the World Steel Association.

In South Africa, all sectors except agriculture contributed to a weaker annual GDP outlook, with tough trading conditions in key steel-consuming sectors: construction, automotive, mining, fabrication, and energy and transport.

First half sales volumes were expected to be about 10% down compared to 2024’s first half. Apart from lower demand, sales volumes for flat steel products continued to be affected by high import levels, whilst long steel product sales reflected the uncertainty around its continuation.

Net realised prices in rand terms were anticipated to be more than 5% lower, impacted in part by a stronger rand-dollar exchange rate.

The steel and manufacturing industry, represented by various industry associations, appeared before the portfolio committee responsible for trade, industry and competition on June 4, 2025.

The industry expressed disillusionment with policy developments and dissatisfaction with the continued decline of the steel sector, which is creating a challenging business and investment climate in South Africa.

Imports now represented more than 35% of apparent steel consumption and significantly undermined domestic supply.

These two financial hubs – in Dubai and Riyadh respectively – have become essential destinations.

African banking offices in the Arab world

Three major African banks have recently announced plans to either open or expand offices in these locations.

Even if global banks are present in the Gulf, they can no longer easily manage the entire corridor. This creates opportunities for African banks to step in

South Africa’s Absa Bank and Kenya’s Equity Bank will both establish offices at Dubai’s DIFC in early 2026, while Nigeria’s United Bank for Africa, already present at DIFC, plans to open an additional office at Riyadh’s KAFD by year-end.

“The primary rationale for these banks is following their clients’ growth ambitions. If major corporations are selling in the Middle East, banks must be there too,” says Frédéric Boutet, an associate director at Africa specialists Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Since 2016, African exports destined for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – comprising Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar – have grown faster than to any other region: up 145%, compared to 100% for China and 70% for the EU.

Dubai: Gateway to global markets

Equity Bank, ranked as Africa’s 16th-largest financial institution according to The Africa Report’s latest top 300 ranking, sees Dubai as integral to its strategic plans. Its goal is to build value chains across East and Central Africa by connecting these to global markets, with the UAE acting as a key entry point.

Equity CEO James Mwangi, alongside fellow banking chiefs Tony Elumelu (UBA) and Kenny Fihla (Absa Bank), recognises the importance of being present in the Arabian Peninsula. The region is a strategic marketplace where banks’ corporate clients find crucial business opportunities in energy, agriculture, and mining.

“Even if global banks are present in the Gulf, they can no longer easily manage the entire corridor. This creates opportunities for African banks to step in,” says Tijsbert Creemers-Chaturvedi, managing director and senior partner at BCG South Africa.

On 8 July, Emirati holding company NG9 agreed to a deal with authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Equity Bank and UBA have strong footholds, to finance a copper and cobalt refinery.

In May, Saudi energy firm ACWA pledged to invest R7bn (around $378m) over five years in water and energy projects, under an agreement with South Africa. African banks in the Gulf could act as co-arrangers for these initiatives.

Taking advantage of international bank withdrawals

Tijsbert Creemers-Chaturvedi, who leads BCG’s financial services practice in Africa, notes that major African banks are well-positioned to benefit from the development of these financial hubs, especially as global banks have struggled to sustain their African presence.

“BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, and Société Générale have closed branches. Even though these banks remain active in the Gulf, they no longer operate seamlessly across the entire Africa-Gulf corridor – African banks can therefore fill this gap.”

International banks see Africa as risky, politically and economically, leaving significant market opportunities open to continental banks.

Gulf nations also offer greater openness to diversified financing compared to their American and Chinese rivals.

A recent Afreximbank report highlights that “GCC investments focus on resource security and economic diversification, while American investment typically emphasises development initiatives and energy challenges. China’s strategy centres on the Belt and Road initiative, expanding markets and acquiring resources to boost trade and connectivity in Asia and Africa”.

A decisive part of African finance now unfolds in Dubai, shaped by East-West dialogue. Here, speed, robust legal frameworks, and deep markets are redefining capital flows

African banks thus stand to gain more than just following their corporate clients. The Middle East doesn’t only import – it invests substantially. Between 2012 and 2022, GCC countries injected $100bn into Africa. Investments between 2022 and 2023 alone reached $113bn, surpassing the previous decade. Over the next five years, investments are expected to range between $20bn and $30bn annually.

Diaspora: A new niche

African banks do not intend to compete directly with local Gulf banks for local customers. Yet, their presence unlocks another important niche: diaspora communities. In 2023, remittances from the Middle East accounted for 27% of total inflows into Africa, overtaking Western Europe’s 23%.

Money transfers from GCC nations to Kenya alone surpassed $3bn, significantly boosting foreign exchange reserves, according to Afreximbank.

Finally, at financial centres such as DIFC or KAFD, African banks aim to gain expertise in structured finance. Mastering these skills will allow them to become lead arrangers and bookrunners in major projects across Africa – roles currently dominated by international banks.

“African banks at DIFC find an ideal environment for creating special-purpose vehicles to structure debt portfolios, securitise trade flows, or set up debt funds, accessing institutional investors, family offices, and advanced compliance platforms,” says Moustafa Mourouvaye, CEO of Brweidge, a structured finance firm operating between Africa, Asia, and the Gulf.

“A decisive part of African finance now unfolds in Dubai, shaped by East-West dialogue. Here, speed, robust legal frameworks, and deep markets are redefining capital flows.”

Firms like Capgemini and HCL Tech are building moats with offshore talent, AI, and IoT expertise.","The global Product Engineering Services (PES) market is on a tear, projected to hit $1.8 trillion by 2030, growing at a 6.8% CAGR fueled by automotive electrification, IoT integration, and the rise of Asia Pacific's talent hubs. This isn't just another tech boom—it's a structural shift toward cost-efficient, AI-driven engineering that's rewriting the rules of product development. For investors, the question isn't whether to allocate capital here, but how quickly to act.

The Drivers: A Perfect Storm of Tech and Talent

The PES market's growth hinges on three pillars:

Automotive Electrification: Automakers are racing to modernize legacy systems for EVs, autonomous features, and “digital-first” consumer expectations. Partnerships like Tata Technologies' collaboration with BMW to build next-gen vehicle platforms are emblematic of this shift. Meanwhile, HCLTech's IoT-enabled vehicle-to-cloud integration and over-the-air updates are cornerstones of modernization.

IoT Integration: IoT isn't just a buzzword—it's a revenue engine. Businesses are embedding connected tech into products, from predictive maintenance systems in factories to telematics in cars. IoT engineering services are booming, with AI and edge computing enabling real-time data analysis.

Asia Pacific Talent Hubs: India's 1,700+ Global Capability Centers (GCCs) are the unsung heroes here. These hubs specialize in product engineering and platform modernization, leveraging 24/7 collaboration, AI-driven test automation, and cost efficiencies. North America leads in market share (thanks to aerospace and advanced manufacturing), but Asia Pacific's talent and scalability are its secret weapon.

The Winners: HCL Tech and Capgemini Are Leading the Charge

The firms best positioned to capitalize on this trend are those with offshore innovation centers and AI-driven engineering at their core. Let's dissect two leaders:

Capgemini: AI as the New Mainframe

Capgemini's Resonance AI Framework is a game-changer. Launched in July 2025, it uses generative AI to accelerate product modernization, with RAISE—a generative AI and AI agents gallery—already contributing 5% of bookings in Q4 2024. Their 6G lab in Gurugram and 5G lab in Mumbai are R&D powerhouses, while their CAALM (AI-Assisted Legacy Modernization) solution automates mainframe refactoring, cutting costs and time for clients like a U.S. life insurer that modernized its COBOL-based systems.

Capgemini's ESG commitments also stand out: 98% renewable energy usage, a 35% emissions reduction since 2019, and partnerships with tech giants like AWS and Mistral AI. This isn't just about profit—it's about future-proofing for a greener, smarter world.

HCL Tech: IoT and Automotive as Growth Engines

HCL's IoT-driven vehicle-to-cloud integration and over-the-air updates are direct responses to automakers' demands for agility. Their focus on model-based systems engineering and AI-driven test automation aligns with the need for faster, more reliable product cycles.

HCL's Global Delivery Model, with hubs in India and Eastern Europe, ensures scalability. Their partnership with Tata Technologies (BMW) and focus on cost-efficient talent pools give them an edge in a market where clients demand both innovation and affordability.

Why Act Now? The Clock Is Ticking

The urgency here is twofold:

1. Demand is outpacing supply: Automotive and IoT firms are desperate to modernize, but legacy systems are a bottleneck. Companies like Capgemini and HCL are the only ones with the tools to solve this at scale.

2. AI is a multiplier, not a fad: Generative AI isn't just a gimmick—it's slashing modernization timelines and costs. Firms that ignore this risk being left behind.

The Investment Case

This isn't a recommendation to “buy the dip.” It's a call to allocate capital now to companies at the forefront of PES modernization. Key metrics to watch:

- Capgemini: Track their AI bookings growth and CAALM adoption rates.

- HCL Tech: Monitor IoT and automotive revenue streams.

The window for cheap entry is narrowing. As automotive giants like GE Aerospace (which invested $1B in additive manufacturing) and IoT-heavy industries ramp up spending, PES providers will be the silent beneficiaries.

Final Take: Don't Miss the Boat

The PES market's 6.8% CAGR isn't just a number—it's a mandate. Firms like Capgemini and HCL Tech are building moats with offshore talent, AI, and IoT expertise. For investors, this is a decade-long opportunity. The question is: Will you be on the boat or left staring at the wake?

Action Items:

1. Add Capgemini and HCL Tech to your watchlist.

2. Monitor sector trends:

3. Act before the herd catches on—these companies are already ahead, but the best gains come early.

The next gold rush isn't in mines or crypto—it's in the engineers coding the future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:13.546247

Shares of Monogram more than doubled to $6.70 in premarket trading. WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Medical device makers, including larger peers Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson are seeking to strengthen their robotic surgery offerings.

The global market for robotic surgery devices is expected to be worth nearly $16 billion by the end of this decade, according to data analytics firm GlobalData.

The deal will allow Warsaw, Indiana-based Zimmer to broaden its robotics platform and gain access to Monogram’s semi-autonomous knee replacement technology, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2025. Zimmer expects to integrate Monogram’s technology and launch fully autonomous surgical robots and additional applications beyond prosthetic knee replacement by 2027.

BY THE NUMBERS

Monogram stockholders will receive $4.04 per share in cash upfront, which represents a premium of 22.8% to its last close. The terms also include up to $12.37 per share in contingent value rights, dependent on certain milestones being met by 2030.

Zimmer Biomet plans to fund the deal with a combination of cash and available debt financing.

WHAT’S NEXT

The deal is expected to close later this year. Zimmer expects the deal to be neutral to adjusted earnings per share until 2027, and accretive to earnings from 2028 onward.

Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s Varipulse platform treats AFib with a single device that combines PFA with the Carto 3 mapping system. Its variable-loop, multi-electrode Varipulse catheter uses laser-cut nitinol tubing for its loop shape. The platform also includes TruPulse generator and the Carto 3 3D cardiac mapping system.

The company joined Medtronic and Boston Scientific as companies with PFA technologies approved for treating AFib when it received an FDA nod in November 2024. Commercial activity hit a snag earlier this year when the company temporarily halted all U.S. cases using Varipulse in January.

Part 1 — Less than half of client-facing employees in public accounting were CPAs last year

The share of CPA-licensed staff working in public accounting firms dropped below 50% in 2024, according to Inside Public Accounting’s latest Data Dive. Research indicates that from 2020 to 2024, the average percentage of staff holding CPA licenses at said firms fell from 56% to 48.4%. At larger firms — where advisory and consulting services continue to expand as private equity money flows in — just over four in 10 (41.5%) of staff held CPA licenses in 2024.

Despite the trend occurring more frequently at larger firms, the decline spans firms of all sizes. This suggests a systemic change in credentialing trends, recruiting strategies and the makeup of public accounting teams — ideas CFOs have shared their thoughts on extensively.

As the accounting profession adapts to talent shortages, how the industry has done so has received mixed reviews. States are now lessening education requirements, while companies have been trying to change the way accountants are perceived through entertainment media and, most recently, highly criticized advertising campaigns from massive technology providers and public accounting firms.

On the inside, firms are increasingly hiring professionals without CPA licenses to fill roles once filled by credentialed or soon-to-be credentialed accountants. Many are also investing in AI tools to automate routine work in audit, tax and financial transformation, further shifting the types of skills they prioritize in new hires. It’s also worth noting that this shift is happening despite a recent, modest uptick in undergraduate accounting enrollment following several years of decline.

For CFOs, these staffing changes have implications beyond the firms themselves. Many finance leaders who rely on these firms for core services like audit, outsourced accounting and consulting expect a certain level of technical expertise. As firms broaden their talent mix, CFOs may need to re-evaluate how they engage with providers and what credentials and capabilities they prioritize when buying services from public accounting firms.

During a July 11 appearance on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily, Harmeet Singh, CFO and chief growth officer at Levi Strauss, emphasized the company's resilience as it deals with challenges around global trade disruptions and economic uncertainty.

Singh pointed to the strength of Levi’s brand and customer relationships as key drivers of confidence. “The brand has never been stronger,” he told interviewers.

Bridging stablecoins and traditional institutions As a federally regulated bank, Circle would act as connective tissue between crypto and established finance.
Accelerating real-world stablecoin use One key advantage of a Circle stablecoin bank is flawless integration.
Industry-wide impacts Circle’s charter could pave the way for a new category of federally recognized crypto bank charter holders.
A successful Circle trust bank would validate the model, encouraging competitors to seek their own national trust charter crypto approvals.","Is Circle launching a digital currency bank?

Circle, the fintech firm behind USDC, has filed an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish America’s first digital currency bank, a national trust institution that would bring stablecoins fully into the federally regulated financial system.

The proposed entity, First National Digital Currency Bank, wouldn’t operate like a traditional consumer bank. It wouldn’t offer deposits or loans. Instead, it would focus on Circle USDC trust bank functions: safeguarding USDC USDCUSD reserves, managing cash and short-term Treasury holdings and offering digital asset custody services to institutional clients.

Circle is becoming a serious contender in global finance. In fact, with over $62 billion in USDC in circulation, it’s the second-largest stablecoin globally.

Until now, reserve management relied on third-party custodians like BlackRock and BNY Mellon. By pursuing a Circle OCC charter application, Circle aims to internalize control, streamline operations, minimize risk and strengthen transparency.

It also aligns Circle with current legislation. The GENIUS Act, passed by the US Senate in June 2025, sets a new bar for regulated stablecoin infrastructure: 1:1 reserve backing, monthly attestations and federal oversight.

By applying for a federal trust charter, Circle shows it’s ready to meet (and help define) future US standards for digital currency banking.

Did you know? In 2024, USDC overtook Tether’s USDt (USDT) in onchain transaction volume (despite being smaller in market capitalization).

Why Circle’s Federal Charter matters for stablecoins and institutional crypto

A federal charter gives Circle regulatory credibility, full control over USDC reserves and the ability to offer secure custody services to institutions.

A stronger regulatory footing

A federal OCC trust charter would immediately improve Circle’s position.

Rather than operating as a BitLicense-only entity or depending on state-by-state clarity, Circle would become a federally regulated bank subject to OCC and Federal Reserve oversight.

For institutions wary of dealing with crypto-native firms, this change demonstrates compliance, permanence and trust, following in the steps taken by Anchorage Digital (currently the only other firm with a crypto bank charter) but with far broader implications, given USDC’s adoption.

Analysts suggest the charter could bolster Circle investor confidence, enabling broader partnerships across banking, fintech and capital markets.

Full control over USDC reserve management

Gaining a national trust charter would bring Circle’s $62.1 billion of reserves in-house. This means Circle can directly oversee the assets that back its stablecoin, adding operational efficiency while reducing counterparty risk.

As trust in stablecoins increasingly hinges on how reserves are held and reported, this move gives Circle stronger guarantees around security, liquidity and compliance with both US and international standards, like Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) compliance and the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation.

Opening new institutional services

As explored, Circle’s new trust wouldn’t offer deposits or retail lending. It would, however, unlock a suite of business-to-business opportunities.

With federal approval, Circle could expand its digital asset custody services — not just for USDC, but for tokenized assets, corporate treasuries and other blockchain-based financial instruments.

In doing so, Circle would develop into payment infrastructure, bridging traditional finance and Web3.

As firms across the globe, from Europe to the United Arab Emirates, pursue licenses (such as the Abu Dhabi crypto license), Circle’s US-based trust bank could serve as a model of how to structurally align with both US stablecoin legislation and global compliance norms.

Did you know? Circle earned roughly $1.7 billion in interest income in 2024 — almost all from holding USDC reserve assets.

Is it the right time for a Circle federally regulated bank?

With investor confidence surging after Circle’s blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) and new federal rules giving stablecoins a regulatory path forward, the conditions are finally right to launch a fully regulated digital currency bank.

Circle’s June 5 debut on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: CRCL) sent a clear message that markets are ready to back a regulated stablecoin issuer.

The stock opened at $69 — more than doubling its $31 listing price — and briefly topped $100 before settling at $83. That day, Circle NYSE IPO CRCL closed with a market cap near $6.9 billion and nearly 200% growth, reflecting soaring demand for companies that sit at the intersection of TradFi and DeFi.

At the same time, Washington gave its strongest nod yet to stablecoin regulation. As touched upon, the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation, passed by the Senate just 12 days after Circle’s IPO, set out comprehensive guardrails: 1:1 dollar backing, real-time attestations and oversight by federal banking regulators such as the OCC.

Under Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood, the agency has signaled support for responsible crypto integration, especially through the Circle OCC charter application process.

With this in mind, Circle’s decision to pursue America’s first digital currency bank feels like a precisely calculated one.

Did you know? Stablecoins facilitated an estimated $27.6 trillion in transactions in 2024, surpassing the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard by about 7.7%

Impacts of the Circle federally regulated bank

Circle’s bank could unlock institutional access, fuel USDC adoption and transmute how stablecoins fit into the global financial system.

Bridging stablecoins and traditional institutions

As a federally regulated bank, Circle would act as connective tissue between crypto and established finance. Pension funds, asset managers and insurers often require federally supervised partners before engaging in digital assets. A Circle digital currency bank, governed under OCC oversight, could unlock these channels.

Moreover, just as money market funds became mainstream after tighter rules boosted trust, Circle aims to make USDC reserve management a benchmark for stability.

Accelerating real-world stablecoin use

One key advantage of a Circle stablecoin bank is flawless integration. Institutional-grade digital asset custody services would support tokenized securities, real-time payments and programmable finance.

With partners like Visa, Stripe and BlackRock already experimenting with Circle payment infrastructure, the next phase is deeper adoption — OAuth-style plug-and-play modules that let banks and fintechs offer USDC without friction.

Industry-wide impacts

Circle’s charter could pave the way for a new category of federally recognized crypto bank charter holders.

Legacy firms like JPMorgan and Bank of America are reportedly working on jointly issuing a stablecoin. A successful Circle trust bank would validate the model, encouraging competitors to seek their own national trust charter crypto approvals.

In terms of the broader impact, we can expect stronger interoperability, better compliance frameworks and greater Circle investor confidence. Whether for regulators, institutions or global partners (like those pursuing MiCA compliance or Abu Dhabi crypto license equivalents), Circle’s move sets a precedent that stablecoins can evolve into bank-grade, regulated infrastructure.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:18:58.049283

While there have been a smattering of second quarter earnings trickling out in the past two weeks, they begin to roll out in earnest this week, starting, as always, with large banks and financial companies.

On Tuesday morning, five mega banks report Q2 earnings, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), and State Street (NYSE:STT). Also, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) releases its first quarter results.

On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), PNC (NYSE:PNC), Bank (NYSE:MTB), and First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) follow suit.

Other notable banks to report this week are US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) on Thursday. Finally, American Express (NYSE:AXP), Ally (NYSE:ALLY), Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW), Truist (NYSE:TFC), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) and Comerica (NYSE:CMA) report Friday.

What should we expect? Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck anticipates investment banking, trading volumes, and higher asset levels to lead the Q2 growth. M&A activity was up 30% in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago, while trading volume rose 49% year-over-year, wrote Graseck in a research note, according to Seeking Alpha. In addition, the Nasdaq gained some 13% in Q2 while the S&P 500 gained roughly 4%.

These results should spur higher revenue and earnings from these banks and financial firms. Banks could also see lower loss provisions due to an improved economic outlook compared to Q1.

Netflix expected to have strong quarter

While banks are in the spotlight, there are some other significant names to report earnings this week, starting with streaming leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Thursday. Analysts expect earnings of $7.06 per share on revenue of $11.04 billion.

Analysts at Wedbush are even more bullish, calling for earnings of $7.18 per share on revenue of $11.16 billion.

“Given the strong backdrop heading into the second half of 2025, we believe Netflix will be well-positioned to exceed its Q2 guidance and provide solid guidance for the remainder of the year,” Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a research note, according to Kiplinger’s.

Other notable earnings this week are grocery store chain Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) on Tuesday; semiconductor firm ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), United Airlines (NYSE:UAL), and consumer staple Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Wednesday; Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) on Thursday, and chemical company 3M (NYSE:MMM) on Friday.

CPI inflation this week

Aside from the earnings kick off, there are two major economic reports to drop this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday. CPI inflation rose in May to 2.4%, marking the first time since January it has gone up.

With the tariffs in full effect, economists expect inflation to rise again in June, with the consensus targeting 2.7% inflation and 3.0% core CPI inflation. The core CPI would be up from 2.8% in May.

The direction of inflation, and the size of any move one way or another, could have a major impact on what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates when it meets on July 30.

The other key economic report to come this week is Retail Sales on Thursday. In May, retail sales actually declined by 0.9%, performing worse than expected, as consumers were cautious in uncertain economic conditions and wary of price hikes. In June, economists project retail sales to increase 0.2%.",https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/banks_1554265923-150x150.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:20:48.742769

That means production must be efficient to avoid passing excess costs on to the market.","Danone is close to meeting its global sugar-reduction target in Brazil. A new version of its children’s product Danoninho, set to launch in August, will help align the Brazilian portfolio with the company’s goal: by 2025, 95% of its children’s products must contain no more than 10% sugar. Currently, one cup contains 11.5% sugar, above the World Health Organization’s recommendation that sugar make up no more than 10% of total calorie intake.

“This reduction couldn’t come at the expense of flavor, otherwise people would stop buying,” said Isabelle Esser, Danone’s executive vice president for human resources, research and innovation, food quality and safety. She said the change in formula reflects investments in innovations using fermentation cultures that help deliver texture, flavor, and natural sweetness.

In 2024, the company invested €447 million in research and development, a 12.3% increase from 2023, according to its financial report. Danone’s global innovation team has 1,700 people, including 45 in Brazil. The country ranks as Danone’s 10th-largest market, with estimated annual revenue of $1 billion. The U.S. leads the ranking with $6 billion, followed by China with $3 billion.

Danone’s main revenue sources are dairy and plant-based beverages, specialized nutrition, and bottled water, including brands like Evian. “Brazil is considered a strategic market with strong growth potential,” said Gustavo Alvarez, director of research and innovation for Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.

Founded 106 years ago to help address childhood digestive issues through food, Danone has recently focused on targeted nutrition. One recent launch in Indonesia includes ingredients that enhance iron absorption, helping treat anemia.

In China, the company introduced a beverage designed to restore gut microbiota diversity—microorganisms in the digestive system—as a way to promote longevity.

Much of Danone’s research is conducted at the Paris-Saclay science and technology cluster, nicknamed the “Silicon Valley of France”, where it operates a research center focused on dairy and plant-based foods. The company developed 130 products there last year and expects to match that output in 2025.

The 21,000-square-meter facility includes laboratories with 1,900 types of fermentation cultures, a pilot factory, and testing rooms where consumers sample innovations and share feedback. A second center in the Netherlands specializes in medical nutrition products, such as supplements for cancer patients.

Danone is also using artificial intelligence to study the more than 100 trillion microorganisms that make up the microbiota. These findings are analyzed at D-Lab in Singapore, which also handles open data analysis. The digital innovation lab has received over €30 million in funding over the past five years.

Biotechnology investments come at a time when global food systems face major challenges, including limited natural resources to produce both animal and plant-based protein. “Science is emerging as an alternative. But most consumers aren’t willing to pay more for sustainable or low-carbon products, it’s just a bonus to them,” Ms. Esser noted.

That means production must be efficient to avoid passing excess costs on to the market. At Danone’s automated plant in Bailleul, France, 5 million yogurt cups are produced daily, 96% of which are consumed domestically, where yogurt is typically eaten as dessert. In the first quarter, Danone’s global sales rose 0.8% to €6.84 billion.

ArcelorMittal South Africa is in last-minute talks with the government to save its struggling steel plants from shutting down, hoping to secure the future for 3,500 workers.

What does this mean?

ArcelorMittal’s South African division is facing tough times, with its long steel operations on the brink due to weak local demand and stiff competition. High electricity prices and inefficient freight logistics worsen the situation, pushing the company toward controversial plant closures. Government discussions are ongoing to prevent these closures, even after previous financial relief from the Industrial Development Corporation. Imports now supply over 35% of local steel needs, and with faltering logistics services, ArcelorMittal's challenges are growing. The firm showed slight improvement in expected headline losses per share, but sales volumes fell 10% in early 2025. Their half-year financial results, due July 31, will reveal more.

Why should I care?

For markets: Industry staples under pressure.

ArcelorMittal's troubles highlight broader issues in South Africa's industrial sector. Escalating operational costs and import dominance are red flags for similar firms, potentially reshaping which sectors investors should monitor. Steel, a backbone for construction and manufacturing, now demands careful watch amid global competition and local inefficiencies.

The bigger picture: Shifting foundations in global trade.

The challenges faced by ArcelorMittal underscore larger trends in global trade dynamics.

The assets spun off could house the retail portions of the company’s ""protect"" and ""balance"" platforms.

Stifel's analysts quantified the accelerate platforms as including condiments, ready-meals brands Mac & Cheese and Ore-Ida, plus snacking lines such as Lunchables and Delimex.

The assets that could be spun off would include Oscar Mayer meats, Jell-O desserts, drinks brands Capri-Sun and Kool-Aid, cheese with Kraft and Velveeta, plus coffee, as in Maxwell House and Gevalia.

Meanwhile, Peter McDonald, a food-industry consultant and former General Mills executive of 20-plus years, weighed in on the failed merger angle of 2015 in what he described as one of the “darkest chapters in CPG food during my career”.

McDonald explained his thoughts in a LinkedIn post: “The new entity pursued a new-to-the-industry aggressive margin expansion playbook that sent competitors chasing ‘zero-based budgeting’ and other nonsensical corporate initiatives in a desperate attempt to avoid being gobbled up themselves.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017. Since then, food-industry reality has reasserted itself and the margin extraction from innovation, marketing, talent, and pricing aggression has taken its toll,” he wrote, putting Kraft Heinz’s current enterprise value at $50bn.

And acknowledging the reports of a spin-off are only based on speculation at this point, he added: “Now the company may be broken up into constituent parts not unlike things were when the whole fiasco started”.

Sales pressure

Kraft Heinz’s 2024 reported sales dropped 3% to $25.85bn, with organic growth down 2.1% in what CEO Abrams-Rivera described as “a challenging year with our top-line results coming in below our expectations”.

Net income fell to $2.74bn, from the $2.86bn booked for 2023. The company also reported a 63.2% slump in full-year operating profit to $1.7bn, which was linked to $3.7bn in non-cash impairment losses.

It was a poor performance echoed in the opening quarter of 2025, too. Net sales dropped 6.4% on a reported basis and declined 4.7% in organic terms to just shy of $7bn. In the three months to 29 March, operating income decreased 8.1% to $1.2bn.

Net income stood at $712m versus $801m a year earlier.

Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.

Kellogg demerger

“There can be no assurance that the company’s assessment process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing,” Kraft Heinz said in a statement in May as it revealed the strategic transaction proposition.

“The company has not set a timetable for completion of this process and does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the process unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.”

Picking up on the WSJ report, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow estimated the likely valuation of the part of the Kraft Heinz grocery business spin-off at $14.5bn, short of the $20bn put forward by the publication.

He, too, linked his observations to the Kellogg demerger. “Bankers and board members of the food industry certainly have noticed the value capture of the 2023 Kellogg split up. After accounting for the Mars and Ferrero acquisitions of the two parts, investors will have realised 41% since the spin, while consumer staples stocks (by our math) fell 6% and fundamentals deteriorated due to changes in consumer preferences and external factors like GLP-1s,” Moskow wrote in a research note.

The TD Cowen analyst also speculated a buyer might step in – whether that’s Kraft Heinz’s intention or not – to snap up the offload, naming McCormick as a potential suitor.

“Our sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates 11% upside to KHC's current enterprise value based on eight times EV/EBITDA for grocery and 10.5x EV/EBITDA for sauces, condiments and spreads,” Moskow suggested.

“However, we could see another 20% upside if a strategic acquirer steps up to buy the sauces and condiments business (about 44% of KHC sales), which will look a lot like the original pre-merger Heinz business of 2013. For example, we see a good strategic fit with McCormick, which has been expanding into the condiments space for several years through tack-on deals, and a high degree of EPS accretion.”

Moskow added to his thesis by explaining that “mega-mergers in food have low success rates and that ‘depth’ tends to beat ‘breadth’”.

He continued: “The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable, and snacks) tend to differ.

“We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.”

Back to 2015

A common theme emanating from food-industry analysts is the throw back to the pre-2015 merger, what AllianceBernstein’s Alexia Howard deemed as a “reversal”.

“When we looked into the relative growth rates of the legacy Heinz company since the companies were merged in 2015, it looks as though the legacy Heinz business has grown retail sales at a 5.3% CAGR over the past decade, while the legacy Kraft brands have grown at only 2%,” Howard wrote in a research note.

“Looking at how the company could break up might mean that the remaining faster-growing company comprises the 25% of companywide sales in international markets plus another 30% of the 75% of the US sales for a total of around 47.5% of companywide sales.”

Howard explained further: “Looking at how the sales could break down, it seems that the faster-growing remaining company could represent around 47.5% of company-wide sales. Clearly, the margins in the international markets are significantly lower than in North America, which could mean that 38.2% of the total company’s adjusted EBITDA of $6.36bn in 2024 potentially sits with the faster-growing remaining company, while the remaining 61.8% sits with the spin-off.”

The Stifel analysts added: “The hypothetical slower growth ‘Spin Co’ would incorporate the retail protect platform featuring a projected low-single digit, ten-year, industry CAGR, high gross margins and low private-label penetration, as well as the retail balance commoditised business platform featuring a flat projected ten-year industry CAGR, low gross margins, and high private-label penetration.

“We view a potential spin of the lower growth and lower-margin retail businesses as a way to unlock value within the higher growth and higher-margin remaining businesses.”

In a world where business decisions are ultimately based on revenue, sales and profits, circular business models are often siloed in sustainability strategies. To mitigate this reality, many fashion businesses are shifting their success metrics to provide clear, quantifiable evidence of how these models unlock resilience and competitiveness.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s latest project — The Fashion ReModel — is working with leading brands, from high-street to high-end, on what it will take to implement circular business models at scale and begin to make the economics work, while also targeting key intervention points to improve commercial viability.

One year into the project, insights reveal which success metrics are most effective for building a compelling business case that drives internal buy-in and brings stakeholders on board.

Establish a revenue-based ambition for circular business models

Resale, rental, repair and remaking models enable businesses to offer new services, providing multiple revenue streams from one product. At the same time, costs can be reduced due to savings from better resource productivity and risk reduction. What the industry is missing is a meaningful metric to demonstrate the contribution of these models to a business’ overall revenue.

Participants of The Fashion ReModel are working towards their own revenue ambitions to increase the percentage of their total revenue derived from circular business models. By using gross percentage revenue, these brands and retailers have moved the success of circular business models into the core of their businesses, with a clear metric to monitor and align around.

H&M Group, for example, has invested in resale models to create additional growth. In 2024, resell sales represented 0.6 percent of H&M Group’s total turnover, up from 0.3 percent in 2022. Contributing to this growth is Sellpy, Europe’s largest secondhand clothing peer-to-peer platform. Sellpy has significantly increased its revenue contribution to H&M, doubling its share since 2022.

Identify new ways to articulate value — starting with customer benefits

In today’s linear system, the profit margins of circular business models can appear lower when compared like-for-like with linear models. The Fashion ReModel partnered with the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business to identify several benefits areas that showcase how circular models can drive business resilience in ways businesses aren’t currently tracking.

One of the critical areas identified is customer benefits. Circular business models offer an opportunity to diversify the relationship with the customer — improving loyalty, engagement and acquisition. Businesses can rethink their customer experiences, designing touchpoints beyond a single product sale.

Arc’teryx, for example, is capitalizing on this opportunity to tap into new customer bases. Its platform for resale and repair services, ReBIRD, has doubled its business year-on-year. Customers can visit ReBIRD Service Centers in stores to assess, wash or repair their product, keeping clothing in the loop and out of landfill.

Quantify the climate mitigation opportunity

With over 500 textiles, apparel, and footwear companies committed to science-based targets or commitments, circular business models offer an opportunity to deliver and demonstrate progress on ambitions by displacing upstream production and keeping products in use for longer, thereby cutting emissions.

Some organizations participating in The Fashion ReModel are using a combination of climate metrics to quantify this impact and further strengthen the business case. Absolute emissions, in particular, is the only metric able to evidence whether businesses are on track to meet decarbonization ambitions.

Take Coach’s Soho denim bag, a product that has been both commercially successful and lowered carbon emissions. It was created by two brands with a long history of reuse and repair. Tapestry (the parent company of Coach) partnered with Bank & Vogue (Canada’s largest secondhand clothing trader) to demonstrate how remaking products out of post-consumer existing denim has a lower environmental impact.

To quantify this, Tapestry commissioned a life-cycle assessment which found that Bank & Vogue’s repurposed denim has up to an 80 percent reduction in GHG emissions compared with conventional first-use denim. With this data, Tapestry can show this product’s ability to help meet its ambitious goal to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Analysts predict Expand Energy Corp. will post the widest normalized EPS beat against expectations in its second-quarter earnings report on July 29, with the predicted $1.34 per share well outpacing the 1 cent normalized EPS reported in the same quarter of 2024.

Albemarle Corp., meanwhile, is forecast to post the largest annual decline in second-quarter earnings, swinging to a normalized loss per share of 67 cents from EPS of 4 cents a year earlier. In a first-quarter earnings release, Albemarle maintained its fiscal 2025 earnings outlook, citing exemptions on tariffs for certain critical minerals that offered a degree of certainty amid an unclear global trade picture.

Most of Magnificent 7 likely to grow as smaller companies struggle

Analysts predict Meta's normalized EPS will rise by about 13% to $5.83, though Tesla's earnings are forecast to fall by more than 19% on an expected drop in revenue.

He’s expected to testify about fallout at Facebook’s parent company from the Cambridge Analytica data mining scandal, in a trial starting Wednesday at the state’s Chancery Court. Meta settled similar class action claims in a California federal court in 2022.

The company may view the derivative case as good for them, win or lose. The claims at issue are notoriously difficult to prove, and the trial comes as Meta explores other states for its corporate home in the wake of unpopular Chancery rulings blamed for pushing Tesla Inc., Dropbox Inc., and other companies out of Delaware.

“Maybe they think the possible threat of them also leaving is enough to sway the court to rule their way and they don’t need to settle anymore,” Southern Methodist University law professor Carliss Chatman said. “Or maybe they want a bad decision so they can justify to the shareholders why they’re moving.”

‘Caremark’ Claims

The main claims in the trial are named for the 1996 Chancery ruling in In re Caremark Int’l Inc. Derivative Litig., which set parameters for oversight liability under Delaware law.

A group of pension funds allege Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg led Facebook to violate a 2012 Federal Trade Commission consent order regarding data sharing. Facebook’s board also failed to monitor the platform’s compliance, they say. They also accuse Zuckerberg of insider trading.

The Delaware lawsuit predates the company’s $5 billion settlement with the FTC in 2019 over policies that allowed Cambridge Analytica, a UK consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, to acquire data from 87 million Facebook users. The pension funds say the board approved the accord to shield Zuckerberg from personal liability.

The FTC’s fine may have been crucial to the court’s 2023 decision allowing the claims to survive a motion to dismiss, but Zuckerberg’s and Sandberg’s high-profile personalities also likely advanced the case, Chatman said.

When corporate leaders’ identities become entwined with the branding, “it kind of makes sense that the Caremark claims should survive, because they give the public the perception that they are more aware and more involved in the company than a typical CEO,” she said. “It feels more like things are their personal decisions.”

Facebook thrived after reaching the FTC settlement, according to the defendants. It invested over $8 billion in its privacy program and preserved Zuckerberg’s reputation, they said.

“Cambridge Analytica was decidedly a traumatic episode for Facebook and its stockholders,” they said. “But it was the product of Cambridge Analytica’s studied deceit—not remotely the product of the bad faith inattention of Facebook’s fiduciaries.”

Evidence and Guidance

Earlier this year, the court sanctioned Sandberg over deleted emails. How the court handles the evidence will be interesting, said Joshua Newcomer of McKool Smith.

“The genesis of Caremark is lack of controls, right? So what does it say, if one of the board members is using personal email and the other board members go along with that, about the overall narrative of control?” Corporate attorneys and their clients want to know what remedies the court could impose if it finds the evidence points to a legal violation, he said.

“I really am going to be looking to see whether the Texas courts take any guidance from the Delaware courts regarding the appropriate relief at the end of a Caremark trial, particularly where the company has already made some adjustments, and whether that’s good evidence or bad evidence for the company,” Newcomer said. “And then what it means in terms of any order for remedial oversight requirements at the company, as opposed to just monetary damages.”

Other companies shouldn’t have anything to worry about so long as their internal controls are implemented in good faith, he said.

Dexit Drama

The trial is being overseen by Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who took over the case in March without explanation, years into litigation that had been before Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster.

The two judges have been lauded as “fearless,” but they’ve also weathered personal attacks from Elon Musk and other critics who believe their rulings illustrate a bias toward minority shareholders.

The venture capital firm co-founded by Meta director Marc Andreessen, who’s expected to testify during trial, cited “an unprecedented level of subjectivity” from the Chancery Court in its decision to relocate to Nevada.

Delaware lawmakers rewrote its corporate statutes in the last couple years in response to rulings by McCormick and Laster. Public records showed Meta executives participated in backroom meetings that led to a new law this year that lowered judge-made guardrails around insider deals, narrowed the definition of a “controlling stockholder,” and limited shareholder access to director texts and emails.

Meta might feel confident because of the unusual outside pressure that any judge in McCormick’s situation would have to acknowledge, said Renee Zaytsev of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.

The tech giant might expect “that a court is going to be wary about putting out another decision against another really big company,” she said.

However McCormick eventually rules—a decision would follow months after post-trial arguments—the stakes are high for Delaware’s attempts to portray itself as balancing the needs of shareholders with those of corporate leaders.

A pro-Meta outcome would send a strong signal that Delaware is pro-company. With a ruling against Meta, however, “I think you’re going to hear renewed discussions about how Delaware remains an unfriendly place for companies,” Zaytsev said.

ID3,Albertsons,2025-07-14 14:04:28+00:00,Retail Brew,Inside the growth of Albertsons's digital business - Retail Brew,Erin Cabrey,,,,,https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2025/07/14/inside-the-growth-of-albertsons-s-digital-business,"Albertsons’ digital sales rose 24% YoY in Q4, the company reported in April, while its loyalty members jumped 15% to 45.6 million.
Digital sales have proven to be crucial to grocery industry growth over the past year.
Albertsons launched its first-party digital experiences through its app just four years ago, and has been working to catch up to its competitors since then, Jill Pavlovich, SVP of digital shopping experiences at Albertsons, who oversees the grocer’s app, website, and in-store digital offerings, told Retail Brew.
Digital native: Four platforms—e-commerce, loyalty, pharmacy and health, and its mobile app—have been key to its blossoming digital business, Sankaran said in January.
Pavlovich is hopeful that customers will be receptive to digital in-store screens, though she noted the grocer has had “varying successes” with other innovations.","Since its highly publicized breakup with Kroger in December, Albertsons has been on a journey to prove that it’s just fine on its own.

The grocer has managed to get its “mojo” back, per former CEO Vivek Sankaran, in part by doubling down on its digital business to help it compete with giants like Walmart and Costco. Albertsons’ digital sales rose 24% YoY in Q4, the company reported in April, while its loyalty members jumped 15% to 45.6 million.

Digital sales have proven to be crucial to grocery industry growth over the past year. E-grocery sales surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, then cooled between 2021 and mid-2024 as shoppers returned to IRL shopping. But sales have picked back up again in the past year as retailers double down on promotions for their pickup and delivery services. Sales jumped 27% YoY to $8.7 billion in May, according to Brick Meets Click.

Albertsons launched its first-party digital experiences through its app just four years ago, and has been working to catch up to its competitors since then, Jill Pavlovich, SVP of digital shopping experiences at Albertsons, who oversees the grocer’s app, website, and in-store digital offerings, told Retail Brew.

“As we think about this year, the path that we have ahead of us, it’s really taking what we’ve developed a step farther and really bringing the digital experiences more deeply into stores,” she said.

Digital native: Four platforms—e-commerce, loyalty, pharmacy and health, and its mobile app—have been key to its blossoming digital business, Sankaran said in January.

Albertsons’s mobile app has served as a “Swiss Army knife of tools” to help shoppers, Pavlovich said, adding that last year was centered around “strengthen[ing] the core” and focusing on the “basics,” with updates that included in-store geolocation with real-time coupons. It’s also recently added a capability for consumers to upload their own recipes or recipes they’ve found online into the app and, using generative AI, digitize them, making the recipes shoppable across Albertsons’s offerings.

“This year is all about taking the things that reduce the cognitive load and taking them a step farther, leveraging the rate at which technology is changing to really give our customers a human multiplier—make it super easy for them to shop with us,” she said.

Daily monitoring of call service logs, checking reviews in the App Store and Google Play Store, and connecting with customers (and non-customers) directly to get their feedback helps the retailer establish both its annual digital product roadmap as well as make any real time adjustments necessary, Pavlovich said.

That continual iteration is necessary as more tech-savvy, younger consumers opt for online shopping for themselves and their early-stage families for the first time, she noted.

“Their expectation of technology is omnichannel experiences, so they have a lot less barriers to entry to engage digitally and convert online,” she said. “If we continue to keep up with our customer and meet their needs through our digital and omnichannel experiences, we’ll see that growth continue for Albertsons and also for the industry as well.”

As Albertsons takes on online grocery leaders like Walmart and Amazon, Pavlovich said its loyalty program (which it streamlined last year) and its “differentiated services” including special occasion planning offerings like catering and party supplies, will help it compete. This year, the grocer aims to add digital ordering capabilities for in-store services like its bakery and floral department, she noted.

Sharp as a tech: Albertsons also announced at Cannes Lions this year that it’s piloting in-store digital ad displays as it looks to grow the reach of its retail media network Albertsons Media Collective. The pilot is in its early days, but Pavlovich said “initial feedback is positive” as the grocer aims to use ads to boost discovery and brand awareness for shoppers.

“It’s not just an ad to be an ad; it really has to aid in the customer shopping journey and purchasing decision,” she said.

Pavlovich is hopeful that customers will be receptive to digital in-store screens, though she noted the grocer has had “varying successes” with other innovations. The in-store mode for its app has been a bright spot, quickly adopted by 10 million customers, Pavlovich said. However, checkout options similar to Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology, which the grocer previously piloted, hasn’t been so well-received.

""It’s been very experience-dependent, and we just continue to watch and keep a pulse, because the trends continue to emerge, and we’re learning of adoption in other industries or from other retailers,” she said. “We want to make sure that we keep up and we try again.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/deae628cabd516381a36c88247ff2c9d973e39cf-5197x3000.jpg?rect=0,135,5197,2728&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-14 11:08:43.330504

On Thursday, Elevance Health, the nation’s second largest health insurer, will be the first health insurer out of the box to report second quarter earnings as rivals reel or recover from higher-than-expected medical costs.
The Elevance Health report comes after government-subsidized health insurance provider Centene withdrew its 2025 financial guidance earlier this month due to higher costs in the individual health plans it sells under the Affordable Care Act as well as rising expenses from enrollees in its Medicaid plans.
Medicare Advantage plans contract with the federal government to provide health benefits to seniors.
CVS is also exiting the individual health insurance business, leaving about 1 million Aetna members in 17 states looking for new coverage in 2026.","For years now, UnitedHealth Group has been the first of the major health insurers to report its quarterly earnings. And Wall Street analysts and investors have looked to the healthcare giant -- which owns the nation’s largest health insurer – for clues on how the sector is doing.

But not this week.

On Thursday, Elevance Health, the nation’s second largest health insurer, will be the first health insurer out of the box to report second quarter earnings as rivals reel or recover from higher-than-expected medical costs. UnitedHealth isn’t reporting its second quarter earnings until the end of the month.

Much is at stake. The Elevance Health report comes after government-subsidized health insurance provider Centene withdrew its 2025 financial guidance earlier this month due to higher costs in the individual health plans it sells under the Affordable Care Act as well as rising expenses from enrollees in its Medicaid plans.

Centene’s announcement was only the latest from a parade of health insurance companies that have struggled in the last two years to control costs of subscribers in plans subsidized by the government. Just last week, Molina Healthcare lowered its earnings guidance for the rest of the year in the face of cost pressures in all three of the government-subsidized health insurance programs it helps manage: Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and individual coverage under the ACA, also known as Obamacare.

And in May, UnitedHealth suspended its financial outlook for the rest of the year and replaced its top executive as the parent of UnitedHealthcare grapples with rising healthcare costs in its Medicare Advantage business. Medicare Advantage plans contract with the federal government to provide health benefits to seniors.

Medicare Advantage plans also contributed to struggles last year for Humana and CVS Health, which elevated a new chief executive in part to help gain control of its struggling Aetna health insurance business. CVS is also exiting the individual health insurance business, leaving about 1 million Aetna members in 17 states looking for new coverage in 2026.

In Elevance Health’s case, chief executive officer Gail Boudreaux, has kept the company’s portfolio of health insurance businesses diversified and somewhat free of issues that have dogged some of its rivals with more than half of its health plan membership coming from commercial or employer group accounts.

Elevance operates a healthy commercial business and is best know for its operation of Anthem brand Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states. In addition, Elevance manages Medicaid via contracts with multiple states and also sells individual coverage under the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.

Analysts at GimmeCredit noted in a report in late April that Elevance’s Medicare Advantage book of business is “considerably smaller than UnitedHealth’s with 2.3 million members, according for 5% of its member mix, of which 15% is group Medicare Advantage.”

Still, Elevance does have exposure to some of the issues its rivals have faced with more than 8 million Americans enrolled in its Medicaid plans and more than 1 million enrolled in individual coverage under the ACA.

“We are constructive on Elevance for its diverse member mix, balance between commercial and government businesses, franchise value and brand recognition in 14 key states through its licenses with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, and efforts to diversify and expand services at Carelon,” GimmeCredit analyst Terri Cancelarich wrote in April.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/634fd98138f2f6f4c4c9a291/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-14 11:09:12.245924

ABT Q2 Estimates

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11.07 billion, suggesting a 6.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pinned at $1.25, indicating a 9.6% improvement from the prior-year registered figure.

Estimate Revision Trend Ahead of Earnings

Estimates for Q2 earnings have remained unchanged at $1.25 per share in the past 30 days.

Let's look at how things might have progressed for the MedTech major prior to the announcement.

Diagnostics: Similar to the previous quarters, we expect the segment’s revenue growth to have been impacted by the year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing revenues.

However, the Diagnostics arm is expected to have benefited from the widespread adoption of its top-tier systems and high testing demand across a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, retail pharmacies and blood screening facilities.

In the core lab business, continued global demand for routine diagnostic testing and continued adoption of the company’s market-leading immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels, including recent large account wins, are likely to have helped sustain growth in the second quarter. The rapid diagnostics business is expected to have gained from the continued expansion of test menus and the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional healthcare settings.

Going by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Diagnostics second-quarter revenues are likely to increase 0.1% year over year.

Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD): Abbott’s EPD business is likely to have continued its impressive streak of strong performance across several regions and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health, central nervous system and pain management. In addition, the company recently identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for EPD. Biosimilars currently represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market. Abbott achieved several milestones in recent times, advancing its portfolio of biosimilars, which are expected to have positively contributed to the company’s second-quarter top line.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s second-quarter revenues indicates a year-over-year increase of 6.1%.

Medical Devices: The segment has been a standout performer for the company, steadily growing over the past several quarters and making a notable impact on the margin performance. In the second quarter of 2025, the business sales are likely to have gained from the Diabetes Care division. This is expected to have been driven by the increasing adoption of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) systems, whose sales surged 20% in the previous quarter.

The electrophysiology portfolio is likely to have delivered robust performance across key regions and product categories. Within Structural Heart, we expect the company to report robust performance, led by the market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. In May, Abbotts’s Tendyne transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) system (designed to treat people with mitral valve disease) received FDA approval.

Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise

Abbott Laboratories price-eps-surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote

Within the Rhythm Management arm, Abbott’s new leadless pacemaker, AVEIR, and the company’s newest implantable cardiac monitor, Assert, are making strides. In April, ABT released favorable clinical study data for its AVEIR and Volt PFA system. In Heart Failure, growth is expected to have been driven by its market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offers treatment for chronic and temporary conditions.

Meanwhile, Vascular arm’s growth can be attributed to Esprit, the company’s below-the-knee resorbable stent. Furthermore, the growth in the Neuromodulation division might have been led by the launch of next-generation delivery system, which will be used to streamline the implantation process for electrodes used as part of its Proclaim dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurostimulation system. All these developments are anticipated to have boosted Abbott’s top line in the quarter under review.

According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Medical device segment’s second-quarter revenues are expected to improve 10.9% year over year.

Nutrition: In this division, the robust sales of adult nutrition brand Ensure are likely to have contributed to its second-quarter top-line performance. We also expect solid quarterly growth across the U.S. portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a 4.3% year-over-year improvement in the segment’s second-quarter revenues.

She also serves as part-time chair of textile manufacturing business Circulose and is co-chair of non-profit organisation The Fashion Pact.

The appointment supports Mango’s model towards a more structured and expert-led management approach, the fashion retailer said.

Mango chairman and CEO Toni Ruiz said: “I am very proud to announce this appointment. We are welcoming an exceptional professional whose vast international perspective and extensive experience in the fashion industry will undoubtedly propel us to new heights.

“Her expertise and visionary approach are invaluable assets that will enrich our leadership team and drive our global ambitions forward.”

Helmersson added: “I’m honoured and excited to join the board of directors and be part of Mango’s growth journey. Mango is pursuing a very ambitious plan, developing the brand and assortment, and bringing it to more customers around the world.

“At the same time, they are part of leading the sustainability practices in the industry. I’m impressed by what they have accomplished and feel very inspired to contribute to the future success”.

Supply of labour expands at steepest rate since November 2020.

Permanent placements drop at fastest pace in 22 months.

Pay growth weakens for perm and temp staff.

Data collected 12-24 June

Summary

Uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June, according to the latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global. Permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Steeper reduction in recruitment activity in June

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

Permanent Placements Index

Temporary Billings

50.0 = no-change

Candidate supply expands at fastest pace since late 2020

The overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Steeper decline in overall vacancies signalled

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Slower growth in starting salaries and temp wages

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

Regional and Sector Variations

Permanent placements fell markedly across all four monitored English regions in June, with the steepest decline seen in the South of England.

Apart from a fractional rise in the Midlands, the decline in temp billings was broad-based and led by the South of England.

Retail saw by far the steepest reduction in demand for permanent staff across the eight job categories that posted a decline. The only sectors to record an increase in permanent vacancies were Construction and Engineering, though upturns were only mild overall.

Six of the ten broad job sectors monitored by the survey registered lower demand for temporary workers in June. The sharpest drops were signalled for Retail and Secretarial/Clerical roles. Construction recorded the strongest growth, experiencing a renewed and solid increase in vacancies.

Comments

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring. But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering - which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery. The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”

Methodology

The KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Survey responses are collected in the second half of each month and indicate the direction of change compared to the previous month. A diffusion index is calculated for each survey variable. The index is the sum of the percentage of ‘higher’ responses and half the percentage of ‘unchanged’ responses. The indices vary between 0 and 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an overall increase compared to the previous month, and below 50 an overall decrease. The indices are then seasonally adjusted.

Underlying survey data are not revised after publication, but seasonal adjustment factors may be revised from time to time as appropriate which will affect the seasonally adjusted data series.

For further information on the survey methodology, please contact economics@spglobal.com.

The introduction of Express Self-Checkout has improved checkout times at both self-checkout and staffed lanes by 8%, the company said.
Other retailers that have recently set new limits on self-checkout items include discounter Five Below and grocery retailer Schnucks.","Why it matters:

Nearly four in five consumers (79.3%) use self-checkout regularly, according to a recent CapitalOne Shopping Research report.

Consumers appreciate the speed of self-checkout, according to NCR Voyix, which found that 70% of shoppers surveyed said they chose self-checkout over staffed lanes because it was faster.

As a result, retailers continue to invest in new self-checkout solutions such in-app checkouts, product-scanning smart carts, and item count limits to enhance the operational efficiency, meet the demands of their customers, and minimize theft.

Retailers are evolving their self-checkout strategies, in many cases leveraging advanced scanning technology and artificial intelligence. They are seeking to derive efficiencies and increase customer satisfaction through these labor-saving solutions while also addressing concerns about retail theft.

Consumers—especially young shoppers—have come to expect self-checkout at retail stores, and many consider it faster and more convenient than attended checkout. A recent CapitalOne Shopping Research report noted that 73% of shoppers prefer self-checkout, and 79.3% use self-checkout regularly. The report also projected that the market for self-checkout technology in North America will more than double during the next five years, reaching $5.43 billion in 2030, up from an estimated $2.63 billion in 2025.

Speed of checkout is one of consumers’ primary reasons for choosing self-checkout, according to a recent report from technology solutions provider NCR Voyix. The company’s research found that 70% of shoppers surveyed said they chose self-checkout over staffed lanes because it was faster. Nearly half (46%) said they prefer self-checkout because they like to bag their own items, and 36% said they opt to do it themselves because the lines are shorter.

Meanwhile, theft continues to be a concern for retailers offering self-checkout. A Lending Tree survey of 2,000 consumers found that 15% of self-checkout users have purposely stolen an item and that 44% of those who have stolen items planned to do so again.

In fact, a few large retailers have removed self-checkout from some of their stores, including Walmart, which eliminated self-checkout machines in a handful of locations last year. While those moves generated some headlines, the retail industry appears determined to make self-checkout work with a variety of strategies that seek to minimize theft, optimize efficiency, and cater to their shoppers’ preferences.

Following are some of that ways that retailers are seeking to turn self-checkout in a win-win for both businesses and consumers.

Retailers such as Target enforce a limit on number of items to speed checkout

Some retailers have made efforts to move their customers through checkout faster by enforcing a limit on the number of items consumers can purchase in self-checkout lanes. This seeks to reduce the bottlenecks that can occur at self-checkout lanes and makes them easier for store employees to monitor.

For example, last year, Target launched a 10-item limit in self-checkout lanes and renamed the service “Express Self-Checkout.” The efforts, combined with a new employee training initiative, have yielded positive results, the company said in a recent blog post.

The introduction of Express Self-Checkout has improved checkout times at both self-checkout and staffed lanes by 8%, the company said. Customers have also reported better checkout experiences overall, whichever option they choose. Target’s Net Promoter Score (NPS, a measure of customer experience) for checkout has improved by five points for wait times and by three points for interaction with employees.

“Express Self-Checkout has been a great success … with both our guests and team members seeing the benefits,” the retailer said.

Other retailers that have recently set new limits on self-checkout items include discounter Five Below and grocery retailer Schnucks.

The mobile-app solution: Putting self-checkout in the palm of customers’ hands

Another variation of self-checkout puts the entire checkout process—or most of it in many cases—in the palm of customers’ hands.

Mobile app–based checkout, which has been available in various forms for several years, gained some traction during the pandemic, with mixed results. More recently, app-based checkout has gained more attention with the announcement that Sam’s Club, the Walmart-owned warehouse-club retailer, is rolling out its latest Scan & Go checkout system at all of its 600-plus locations in the United States.

The system leverages the retailer’s Scan & Go mobile app, which shoppers use to scan items as they shop and pay for their purchases automatically, without the use of a self-checkout lane at all. The app has been available to members of the warehouse club since 2016, but Sam’s Club said it is now using AI-powered scanning technology to verify the content of shopping carts, which eliminates the need for employees to visually compare shoppers’ paper receipts to the content in their carts.

Sam’s Club’s two major rivals, Costco and BJ’s, have self-checkout apps of their own that they’ve been promoting to their customers. In addition to eliminating the need to wait in lines at checkout, the apps also off other features, such as product location and access to coupons and promotions.

In Costco’s recent fiscal third-quarter conference call with investors, CEO Ron Vachris said the company has been testing digital technologies to improve the speed of checkout.

“We’ve engaged in some ‘Scan & Go done by Costco’ kind of tests that have been extremely successful moving people through the lines and expediting the transactions,” he said.

Some “very, very early” results have been positive, and member adoption has also been encouraging, he said.

Amazon’s ‘Just Walk Out’ tech still has legs; in test mode at WHSmith North America

High-tech checkout solutions that use cameras and other monitors to record shoppers’ purchases are also expanding, despite some early challenges. Amazon’s aptly named Just Walk Out technology, for example, has proven to be successful at small retail stores where customers are pressed for time, such as in airports and sports venues and at student halls on college campuses, according to the company.

With the Just Walk Out platform, customers generally scan a credit card when they enter the store, and a system of sensors and cameras monitors which items they select and leave the store with. Amazon last year said it had plans to double the number of third-party stores using Just Walk Out. Among the retailers testing the technology is WHSmith North America, which operates retail stores in airports. It debuted Just Walk Out at a location in New York’s LaGuardia Airport in 2022.

The technology appears to be gaining traction in small stores where customers are buying a limited number of items—like a bottle of water or a box of popcorn—but it has yet to prove itself in bigger, more complicated shopping trips such as a weekly grocery shop at a full-scale grocery store.

Smart carts, ‘self-checkout on wheels,’ are on a roll

Sometimes described as “self-checkout on wheels,” so-called smart carts use a combination of sensors, built-in scales, and cameras to automatically scan items as customers shop. They also incorporate interactive touch screens and features that enable digital payments in order to smooth the checkout process.

Instacart, the third-party grocery delivery specialist, has rolled out a smart cart called Caper Cart that allows brands and retailers to promote products to customers as they shop, among other features. Customers can also see a running tally of their purchases, sync with their digital shopping list, and search for products’ locations in the store. The carts have been tested or rolled out at several grocery chains, including Schnucks and Save Mart.

Amazon, meanwhile, as its own version of smart carts called Dash Carts, which it has deployed in its 65 Amazon Fresh grocery stores in lieu of Just Walk Out technology. The company is also testing the technology in a handful of its Whole Foods Market locations. When customers are done shopping, they simply push their carts through special, sensor-equipped Dash Cart lanes, and then bag their own groceries.

A spokeswoman for Albertsons Saturday called the recently approved contract covering unionized workers at four Southern California supermarket chains “fair and equitable.”

“We are pleased to have reached a fair and equitable agreement with the UFCW,” said Courtney Carranza, director of communications and public affairs of the Southern California Division of Albertsons. Albertsons is also the parent company of Pavilions and Vons.

“We appreciate the union’s partnership in reaching a contract that will benefit our associates and allow us to continue to serve our customers in Southern California.”

Key provisions of the agreement include substantial wage increases, a new supplemental pension plan to help workers in their retirement, increased health care benefit contributions, faster health care eligibility for new hires and staffing language that includes the union “in evaluating reasonable staffing levels that address efficient operation of the stores, the health and safety of employees, and the quality of customer service,” according to the union.

The six UFCW locals released a statement saying “the journey to contract ratification saw a record turnout of grocery workers, customers, and community members, all fighting for the same thing — better stores, better lives, better communities. They fought to ensure that grocery workers could feed their own families and afford health benefits and a dignified retirement at the end of a long career. They also fought for more staffing to improve the customer experience at their stores.

“Their fight took to the streets where they organized numerous rallies and marches that showed their power. It took to their stores where they stood up and demonstrated their unity by signing petitions and wearing buttons. Grocery workers also joined with customers in the fight for better staffing, talking to over 3,000 customers about their shopping experiences and sharing their feedback with these companies that can afford to do better.

“These actions built the strength needed to reach this agreement. Only by rising up together were grocery workers able to make a change in their workplaces that will benefit all grocery workers and customers in the future.”

The contracts will go into effect immediately.

Workers’ separate contracts with Ralphs and Albertsons expired on March 2.

The union announced June 11 that its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike. Although a walkout had not been called by the union, workers held a series of “practice strike” demonstrations.

A tentative agreement had been reached July 2, subject to approval by union members.

There was no immediate response to an email sent late Friday night to a spokesman for Ralphs seeking comment.

For loyal customers and longtime employees, the announcement feels less like a corporate manoeuvre and more like the end of a relationship. Kroger, one of America’s most recognised supermarket names, is preparing to close 60 stores across the country—a surgical cut to its vast empire of over 2,700 outlets.

But this is more than a routine consolidation. It is, in many ways, the visible scar left by an invisible war—a failed merger, regulatory pressure, shifting consumer patterns, and the changing geography of American retail.

Texas First, but Not Alone

The first confirmed farewell comes from McKinney, Texas, at 1707 W. University Drive—30 miles from Dallas, where generations of families picked up their weekly groceries, prescriptions, and household staples. Over the next 18 months, more doors will shut in Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Indiana, Louisiana, and Virginia.

These closures are not abrupt—there will be no sudden extinguishing of lights. Kroger is planning a slow retreat, giving communities time to adjust, employees time to transfer, and competitors time to circle.

The Collapse of a Supermarket Superpower Dream

Just months ago, Kroger was preparing for a different kind of announcement: a historic merger with Albertsons that promised to rewrite the rules of grocery retail in the United States. Together, the two giants would have rivalled Walmart’s dominance and defied Amazon’s digital siege on the physical store.

But regulators thought otherwise. The FTC, under increasing political and public scrutiny, blocked the deal. They feared monopoly, price hikes, and a vanishing middle ground for consumers. In rejecting the merger, the government sent a clear message: big isn’t always better.

Now, without its Albertsons alliance, Kroger must navigate alone. And the map has changed.

Why the Closures Matter

On paper, 60 stores out of 2,731 sounds negligible—just over 2%. But to the communities they serve, they are the cornerstones of daily life. A supermarket is never just a place to buy food. It is a place of routine, familiarity, sometimes even sanctuary.

For employees, many of whom have worked in these stores for years or decades, the closures are personal. The company insists relocation options are on the table—but not everyone will find their way back into the fold.

And for shoppers? It’s not just about convenience. It’s about trust. Trust built on weekly visits, knowing where every item sits, and being greeted by name. When a supermarket vanishes, it creates a hole in the neighbourhood that no press release can fill.

An Industry at a Crossroads

Kroger’s retreat marks a moment of reckoning. The American grocery landscape is being reshaped not just by economics, but by emotion, ethics, and evolving expectations.

Consumers want value—but also connection. They demand technology—but not at the expense of human touch. They are shopping with their values, their wallets, and increasingly, their feet.

Kroger’s closures are a lesson for all large retailers: scale is not security. Survival now hinges on precision, empathy, and adaptability.

What’s Next for the Retail Giant?

Kroger has not said this explicitly, but the closure of underperforming stores is an act of self-preservation. Without the Albertsons merger to carry it into the future, it must now streamline, refocus, and perhaps even reinvent.

Whether this is the beginning of a leaner, smarter Kroger or the slow fade of a once-unquestioned titan remains to be seen. What’s certain is this: in every zip code where the lights go out, Kroger leaves behind more than a vacant building—it leaves behind memories, habits, and a space waiting to be filled.

And in American retail, empty spaces never stay empty for long.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-download-4-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:08:51.166187

Nike is said to be focusing on different sports categories across its various brands, including Nike, Jordan, and Converse.

The brand has been grappling with slower sales growth and increasing competition within the global market recently.

In its fourth-quarter revenues of fiscal 2025, Converse recorded a 26% decrease in sales, amounting to $357m on both reported and currency-neutral bases. The brand also saw a 19% drop in annual revenue to $1.7bn, with an 18% decline on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues at Nike fell 10% to $46.31bn in FY25.

These challenges have led to cost-cutting initiatives and a strategic shift towards performance-oriented sports products.

Carver's tenure at Converse spanned 15 years and included key leadership positions in North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Cain, who has been with Nike for over two decades and currently serves as vice president and general manager of Nike Global Men's, is set to assume his new responsibilities after a transition period concluding at the end of July.

Cain's appointment follows a broader series of executive reshuffles at Nike.

In May this year, the company promoted Amy Montagne, Global Women’s VP/GM to president at Nike.

Phil McCartney, formerly VP of Footwear advanced to EVP, chief innovation, design and product officer.

Chief marketing officer Nicole Graham was also promoted to EVP, chief marketing officer to lead Nike, Jordan and Converse.

Tom Clarke, the strategic advisor to the CEO, transitioned into the role of chief growth initiatives officer.

Wegmans announced the launch of Caper Carts, Instacart’s AI-powered smart carts, at its Dewitt location in Syracuse, New York, earlier this month.

“This marks the first deployment of Caper Carts at Wegmans,” the press release said.

The innovation — part of the Instacart’s technology Connected Stores — allows customers to track their spending while shopping. The carts will automatically recognize items as they are put into them, and customers can bag as they shop.

The tech — including cameras, a digital scale and location sensors — also allows for a seamless checkout, enabling payment for items directly from a cart and eliminating having to wait in a checkout line.

The tool that tracks spending as you shop could make a huge difference for shoppers on a budget, as they won’t have to anxiously await the total cost at checkout.

To use the wheeled tool, Wegmans shoppers can log in to their Shoppers Club account via a screen on the cart.

“Caper Carts are transforming everyday grocery shopping into a faster, more personalized experience,” the Chief Connected Stores Officer at Instacart, David McIntosh, said in a statement.

While Instacart’s Caper Carts are only being tested at the Syracuse location, a representative for Wegmans told Food & Wine that they are “doing smart cart test-and-learn pilots in four stores — Perinton and Pittsford in Rochester, Alberta Drive in Buffalo, and at our Dewitt store in Syracuse — with two different technology providers,” adding that they “are limiting the program to these stores as we gather customer feedback to drive improvements.”

Whether the technology will expand to more Wegmans stores is dependent on how smoothly the grocery shopping process goes at the test stores.

The proposed separation would carve out several Kraft-branded products - primarily packaged meals, processed meats, and slower-moving grocery staples - into a new entity. The existing company would retain higher-growth categories such as condiments and sauces, including Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard.

Kraft Heinz said in May that it was reviewing strategic options to unlock shareholder value but has not confirmed any specifics regarding a spinoff.

Spinoff mirrors industry pivot as processed food demand slows

The planned breakup marks a major shift for a company once seen as a symbol of efficiency and global scale after the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, orchestrated by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. Since then, the firm has faced headwinds from changing consumer preferences, inflation, and growing competition from private labels.

Kraft Heinz has also faced setbacks in selling underperforming brands like Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House, and in 2019, it wrote down $15 billion in value from its Kraft and Oscar Mayer businesses. The company has promised to remove artificial colours from U.S. products, following increased scrutiny of food additives.

Shares of Kraft Heinz rose 2% on Friday following the Journal's report. The stock has lost over 60% of its value since the merger, erasing nearly $57 billion in market capitalisation.

The potential split reflects a broader trend in the packaged food industry. Kellogg Co separated its business into Kellanova and WK Kellogg last year, and this week, WK Kellogg agreed to a $3 billion sale to Italy's Ferrero Group.

While discussions are ongoing and final terms may change, the spinoff would result in two independently operated companies with focused portfolios. Berkshire Hathaway remains Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder but has stepped back from board involvement, while 3G Capital exited the company in 2023.

The move underscores how legacy food giants are adapting to a market that increasingly favours fresher products, streamlined operations, and sharper brand focus.

The South African unit of world number two steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA initially said in November 2023 it planned to close the two plants, citing weak domestic demand, high electricity tariffs, poor freight logistics and competition from local scrap metal recycling mini-mills and imports from China.

“Regrettably, limited progress has been made to date in redressing the major structural impediments,” ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a trading update. It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

South Africa’s trade and industry minister Parks Tau told lawmakers on July 4 that the government was in “firefighting mode” as it tries to avoid the closure of ArcelorMittal’s operations in KwaZulu Natal and near Johannesburg.

The closure of the plants, which supply rail, roads and bars to the construction, mining and manufacturing sectors as well as components for the automotive industry, has been deferred twice as the company and the government sought to save the 3,500 jobs directly under threat.

In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.

Imports have flooded the domestic market, taking up more than 35% of local steel demand, while freight rail service “deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk,” the steelmaker’s statement said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa expects to report a headline loss per share between 0.89 rand and 0.99 rand ($0.0498-$0.0554) for the six months to June 30, narrowing its loss from 1 rand per share during the same period last year.

Sales volumes declined by about 10% in the first half of 2025 compared to last year, the company said.

ID23,Kraft Heinz,2025-07-14 12:58:27+00:00,Just Food,Ill-fated 2015 merger comes to fore amid Kraft Heinz spin-off speculation - Just Food,Simon Harvey,,,,,https://www.just-food.com/features/kraft-heinz-spin-off-speculation/,"CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, in the job for only 18 months, may well have been encouraged by the split initiated by Kellogg Company in 2023.
Sauces, condiments and spreads such as its namesake ketchup brand and the Grey Poupon Dijon mustard line would remain as Kraft Heinz.
The WSJ report, meanwhile, came days after Kraft Heinz announced the sale of a handful of brands in Italy to the recently created NewPrinces for €120m ($140.2m).
“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017.
Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.","A “strategic transaction” proposition put forward by Kraft Heinz in May could well be about to emerge with a business split a tad over the ten-year anniversary of the mega-merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz.

Such a development would surely not be much of a surprise to market watchers following a slew of poor results from Kraft Heinz and perhaps a veiled submission of what might be considered as the failed combination of 2015 – the company’s shares are currently trading at $27.14 in New York compared to circa $88 when that deal was completed on 2 July of that year.

Berkshire Hathaway, the US investment group led by Warren Buffett, is reportedly weighing up the disposal of its estimated 27% share in the Heinz ketchup maker, while private-equity firm 3G Capital, which joined the billionaire in the 2015 business combination, is long gone having sold its shares in 2023.

Kraft Heinz pledged in May to “unlock shareholder value” as the company assessed strategic options for a business that generated revenue of $26bn last year. CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, in the job for only 18 months, may well have been encouraged by the split initiated by Kellogg Company in 2023.

Confectionery giant Ferrero announced a $3.1bn deal for WK Kellogg last week, the North American breakfast cereals business that emerged from that separation. The other portion, Kellanova, is in the throes of a $35.9bn takeover by another sweets heavyweight, Mars.

A valuation of $20bn has been attached to a potential spin-off by Kraft Heinz, according to unnamed sources at The Wall Street Journal, which reported on Friday (11 July) a demerger may feature a ‘large chunk of its grocery business’. Sauces, condiments and spreads such as its namesake ketchup brand and the Grey Poupon Dijon mustard line would remain as Kraft Heinz.

Industry analysts were quick off the blocks to comment on the speculation, no doubt galvanised by the speed in which the Ferrero-WK Kellogg deal came to fruition last week, from speculation through to fact the same day.

The WSJ report, meanwhile, came days after Kraft Heinz announced the sale of a handful of brands in Italy to the recently created NewPrinces for €120m ($140.2m).

“Non–sensical”

Investment bank Stifel, in a report led by Matthew Smith, threw some perspective on what might emerge.

“We believe the potential spin of a part of the grocery business would include the company’s slower growth and highly competitive/commoditised categories, with the remaining entity keeping Kraft’s priority platforms including sauces/condiments and snacking/easy meals.

Smith said the Stifel analysts believe the faster-growing assets to remain would include Kraft Heinz’s North America retail “accelerate” platforms, the company’s global away-from-home unit and its emerging markets businesses. The assets spun off could house the retail portions of the company’s “protect” and “balance” platforms.

Stifel’s analysts quantified the accelerate platforms as including condiments, ready-meals brands Mac & Cheese and Ore-Ida, plus snacking lines such as Lunchables and Delimex.

The assets that could be spun off would include Oscar Mayer meats, Jell-O desserts, drinks brands Capri-Sun and Kool-Aid, cheese with Kraft and Velveeta, plus coffee, as in Maxwell House and Gevalia.

Meanwhile, Peter McDonald, a food-industry consultant and former General Mills executive of 20-plus years, weighed in on the failed merger angle of 2015 in what he described as one of the “darkest chapters in CPG food during my career”.

McDonald explained his thoughts in a LinkedIn post: “The new entity pursued a new-to-the-industry aggressive margin expansion playbook that sent competitors chasing ‘zero-based budgeting’ and other nonsensical corporate initiatives in a desperate attempt to avoid being gobbled up themselves.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017. Since then, food-industry reality has reasserted itself and the margin extraction from innovation, marketing, talent, and pricing aggression has taken its toll,” he wrote, putting Kraft Heinz’s current enterprise value at $50bn.

And acknowledging the reports of a spin-off are only based on speculation at this point, he added: “Now the company may be broken up into constituent parts not unlike things were when the whole fiasco started”.

Sales pressure

Kraft Heinz’s 2024 reported sales dropped 3% to $25.85bn, with organic growth down 2.1% in what CEO Abrams-Rivera described as “a challenging year with our top-line results coming in below our expectations”.

Net income fell to $2.74bn, from the $2.86bn booked for 2023. The company also reported a 63.2% slump in full-year operating profit to $1.7bn, which was linked to $3.7bn in non-cash impairment losses.

It was a poor performance echoed in the opening quarter of 2025, too. Net sales dropped 6.4% on a reported basis and declined 4.7% in organic terms to just shy of $7bn. In the three months to 29 March, operating income decreased 8.1% to $1.2bn.

Net income stood at $712m versus $801m a year earlier.

Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.

Kellogg demerger

“There can be no assurance that the company’s assessment process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing,” Kraft Heinz said in a statement in May as it revealed the strategic transaction proposition.

“The company has not set a timetable for completion of this process and does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the process unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.”

Picking up on the WSJ report, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow estimated the likely valuation of the part of the Kraft Heinz grocery business spin-off at $14.5bn, short of the $20bn put forward by the publication.

He, too, linked his observations to the Kellogg demerger. “Bankers and board members of the food industry certainly have noticed the value capture of the 2023 Kellogg split up. After accounting for the Mars and Ferrero acquisitions of the two parts, investors will have realised 41% since the spin, while consumer staples stocks (by our math) fell 6% and fundamentals deteriorated due to changes in consumer preferences and external factors like GLP-1s,” Moskow wrote in a research note.

The TD Cowen analyst also speculated a buyer might step in – whether that’s Kraft Heinz’s intention or not – to snap up the offload, naming McCormick as a potential suitor.

“Our sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates 11% upside to KHC’s current enterprise value based on eight times EV/EBITDA for grocery and 10.5x EV/EBITDA for sauces, condiments and spreads,” Moskow suggested.

“However, we could see another 20% upside if a strategic acquirer steps up to buy the sauces and condiments business (about 44% of KHC sales), which will look a lot like the original pre-merger Heinz business of 2013. For example, we see a good strategic fit with McCormick, which has been expanding into the condiments space for several years through tack-on deals, and a high degree of EPS accretion.”

Moskow added to his thesis by explaining that “mega-mergers in food have low success rates and that ‘depth’ tends to beat ‘breadth’”.

He continued: “The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable, and snacks) tend to differ.

“We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.”

Back to 2015

A common theme emanating from food-industry analysts is the throw back to the pre-2015 merger, what AllianceBernstein’s Alexia Howard deemed as a “reversal”.

“When we looked into the relative growth rates of the legacy Heinz company since the companies were merged in 2015, it looks as though the legacy Heinz business has grown retail sales at a 5.3% CAGR over the past decade, while the legacy Kraft brands have grown at only 2%,” Howard wrote in a research note.

“Looking at how the company could break up might mean that the remaining faster-growing company comprises the 25% of companywide sales in international markets plus another 30% of the 75% of the US sales for a total of around 47.5% of companywide sales.”

Howard explained further: “Looking at how the sales could break down, it seems that the faster-growing remaining company could represent around 47.5% of company-wide sales. Clearly, the margins in the international markets are significantly lower than in North America, which could mean that 38.2% of the total company’s adjusted EBITDA of $6.36bn in 2024 potentially sits with the faster-growing remaining company, while the remaining 61.8% sits with the spin-off.”

The Stifel analysts added: “The hypothetical slower growth ‘Spin Co’ would incorporate the retail protect platform featuring a projected low-single digit, ten-year, industry CAGR, high gross margins and low private-label penetration, as well as the retail balance commoditised business platform featuring a flat projected ten-year industry CAGR, low gross margins, and high private-label penetration.

“We view a potential spin of the lower growth and lower-margin retail businesses as a way to unlock value within the higher growth and higher-margin remaining businesses.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/shutterstock_2501948921-heinz-edited.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:05:32.391146

Developed by the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium, the project brings together ENGIE (35%), Orascom Construction PLC (25%), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (20%), and Eurus Energy Holdings (20%).
Since 2015, the country’s renewable output has increased by over 340%, with wind energy playing an increasingly central role.
François Xavier Boul, ENGIE’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasised the project’s economic and environmental value: “This renewable energy is cheaper than burning gas.
Looking ahead, the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium is already planning a follow-up project expected to exceed 900 MW, further consolidating Egypt’s role as a renewable energy leader on the African continent.","ENGIE has successfully commissioned the 650-megawatt Red Sea Wind Energy project, making it the largest operational wind farm in both the Middle East and Africa. Located on Egypt’s Red Sea coast near Ras Ghareb, the onshore wind complex is now fully operational and delivering clean power to more than one million homes.

The project was delivered in phases, with the first 306 MW coming online in December 2024, followed by an additional 194 MW in April 2025. The final 150 MW segment was completed in June, bringing the project to full capacity four months ahead of schedule. This early completion highlights both the efficiency of the project team and the strength of collaboration between international and regional partners.

Developed by the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium, the project brings together ENGIE (35%), Orascom Construction PLC (25%), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (20%), and Eurus Energy Holdings (20%). Together, these partners have built a landmark facility that will cut around 1.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, while helping Egypt meet its ambitious renewable energy targets.

Safety was a top priority throughout construction. The team completed over seven million man-hours without a single lost-time incident, reflecting a strong safety culture and project discipline. This is particularly notable for a development of this scale and complexity.

The wind farm operates under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), ensuring long-term economic and grid stability. The project’s financing was secured through a consortium of international institutions including Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Norinchukin, Société Générale, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), with additional support from NEXI.

This milestone boosts ENGIE’s renewable footprint in Egypt to nearly 1 gigawatt, reinforcing its strategic position in the region. Egypt, meanwhile, is making major strides in expanding its renewable capacity—aiming for 42% of its electricity mix to come from renewable sources by 2030. Since 2015, the country’s renewable output has increased by over 340%, with wind energy playing an increasingly central role.

François Xavier Boul, ENGIE’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasised the project’s economic and environmental value: “This renewable energy is cheaper than burning gas. It clearly allows for burning less gas and for the country to either import less or export more.”

ENGIE’s broader ambition is to expand rapidly across the MENA region, where faster permitting and shorter development timelines offer an edge over markets in Europe and North America. The company is targeting 95 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030, up from about 51 GW today.

Looking ahead, the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium is already planning a follow-up project expected to exceed 900 MW, further consolidating Egypt’s role as a renewable energy leader on the African continent. With this flagship development, Egypt not only strengthens its energy independence but also sets a replicable model for other nations in the region aiming to accelerate their energy transition.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/hqahcvem/wind-energy-desert.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=132741752282930000,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:14.403716

Consumer spending continues to benefit from a resilient labor market, though momentum has begun to moderate. The resumption of student loan payments in the U.S. has added financial pressure on households, compounding concerns over rising tariffs. Earlier this year, anticipation of new tariffs prompted a pull-forward in spending, particularly on big-ticket items like motor vehicles. All the heightened discussion around tariffs has not only impacted business strategies but also weighed on consumer sentiment. The constant media coverage and policy uncertainty have made consumers increasingly anxious about potential price hikes and economic instability, further dampening their willingness to spend. Moreover, it has led many retailers to revise their earnings outlook downward for the remainder of the year.

Accordingly, the Q1 2025 LSEG Retail/Restaurant Index 7.5% earnings growth rate is expected to decline to -1.7% in Q2 2025, its first negative showing since the pandemic, underscoring a slowdown in consumer spending (Exhibit 2). The index is also estimated to remain in the low single digits for the second half of the year. Similarly, the blended revenue growth estimate for the 197 companies in this index is 2.0% for Q2 2025 (Exhibit 2). This is also the weakest showing since the pandemic and is also expected to remain below 3.0% for the second half of the year. Looking ahead, retailers are bracing for a challenging and volatile environment. They report that consumers are increasingly value-conscious, navigating a landscape shaped by persistent inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, regulatory uncertainty, and tariff-related disruptions.

A closer look at the data reveals that this year’s slowdown is concentrated around three main consumer sectors. The Leisure Products sector is expected to post the weakest Q2 2025 performance, with profits projected to decline by 44.7% (Exhibit 3). The Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods sector follows, with a -44.4% growth estimate that reflects underlying softness in earnings momentum. Both sectors are also forecast to deliver the weakest earnings growth in the second half of the year. Additionally, the Household Durables sector is on track to report negative earnings growth for 2025, further highlighting the pressure facing consumer discretionary categories.

This is in line with the LSEG/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index, which finds that overall American consumer sentiment has declined for three consecutive months. The latest drop in consumer sentiment is driven by a sharp decline in purchasing comfort and the continued decline in current views of the job market. Previously, much of the unease shown by consumers was rooted in fears about the future of the economy. However, consumers are now more pessimistic about their current situation. American consumer confidence continues to demonstrate the broader economic uncertainty the public feels today.

Despite broader sector challenges, there are pockets of optimism. Looking ahead to Q2 earnings, analysts surveyed by LSEG are already bullish on MGM Resorts International. The consensus estimate for MGM’s Q2 2025 EPS stands at $0.52. Notably, a highly rated five-star analyst with a very accurate rating has issued a Bold Estimate of $0.83, significantly above the consensus. This divergence suggests a potential earnings beat and the possibility of a positive surprise when MGM reports.

The StarMine SmartEstimate is a weighted average of analyst estimates, with more weight given to more recent estimates and more accurate analysts. Our studies have shown that when the SmartEstimate differs from the consensus (I/B/E/S mean) by more than 2%, the company is likely to post subsequent earnings surprises directionally correct 70% of the time. This percentage difference is referred to as the Predicted Surprise (PS%) (Exhibit 4).

Similarly, the companies listed below have a Predicted Surprise exceeding 2.0% for Q2 2025, Q3 2025, and the current fiscal year. This indicates a strong likelihood of outperforming earnings expectations and delivering positive surprises.

Conversely, the companies listed below have a negative Predicted Surprise of less than -2.0% for Q2 2025, Q3 2025, and the current fiscal year; indicating they are likely to miss earnings expectations and deliver negative surprises.

Pricing pressures

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.1% month-over-month from April to May 2025, and 2.4% year-over-year. Retailers continue to face headwinds from weak consumer sentiment and a value-conscious shopper grappling with elevated living expenses. The CPI data highlights that consumers are contending with higher costs for essentials such as food, electricity, medical care, and transportation compared to a year ago.

However, apparel prices have bucked the broader inflation trend, declining 0.4% month-over-month and 0.9% year-over-year. This trend is consistent with LSEG data, which shows widespread apparel price reductions. In collaboration with Centric Market Intelligence, we are tracking weekly average original prices across selected categories in U.S. mall stores. Since December 2024, average prices have been monitored weekly through June 2025. Among the categories tracked, Men’s Apparel has experienced the steepest decline, with prices falling 3.0%, followed by Women’s Apparel falling 2.2% (Exhibit 7).

Discount levels – U.S. online retailers

Despite declining apparel prices, retailers are offering fewer promotions. The discount penetration, defined as the percentage of merchandise on sale, has fallen below the historical range of 34% to 42% observed over the past decade (Exhibit 8). Year-to-date in 2025, the average discount penetration stands at just 26%, down from 34% last year and below pre-pandemic levels. This shift comes at a time when retailers are contending with increasingly value-conscious consumers, highlighting a strategic shift in promotional activity amid evolving demand dynamics.

However, the average percent discount has remained relatively stable at 35%, just below last year’s average of 36%.

E-commerce sales

According to the latest e-commerce report from the U.S. Census Bureau, online sales reached $300 billion in Q1 2025, representing a 6.1% year-over-year increase. However, this marks a slowdown from the 7.6% growth observed over the past year (Exhibit 14). LSEG data suggests that total consumer spending online in 2025 is likely to remain below 2024 levels.

E-commerce currently accounts for just 16.2% of total U.S. retail sales, indicating that the majority of consumers still prefer shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. A significant portion of the retail market remains underpenetrated by major online players like Amazon.

Shifting consumer behavior

Retailers have just concluded reporting Q1 2025 earnings, with 88% referencing tariffs during their earnings calls, underscoring the growing influence of trade policy on the sector. New and expanded tariffs on imports from key trade partners, including China, are reshaping cost structures and altering supply chain dynamics. While large retailers such as Walmart have the scale, capital, and pricing power to absorb or strategically offset these pressures, smaller players remain significantly more vulnerable, with limited flexibility to manage rising costs and operational disruptions.

Despite elevated import costs, many retailers are choosing to absorb part of the burden rather than risk losing demand from increasingly price-sensitive consumers. Preserving market share has become a top priority, prompting companies to implement mitigation strategies such as diversifying supply chains, renegotiating supplier terms, and optimizing inventory management. Still, some are selectively raising prices or absorbing costs to remain competitive in a challenging environment.

The recent decline in consumer sentiment reflects a sharp drop in purchasing confidence, driven largely by rising prices, and a continued deterioration in perceptions of the labor market. While earlier concerns were centered on long-term economic uncertainty, consumers are now increasingly focused on immediate financial pressures.

Although gasoline prices have eased over the past four months, renewed tensions in the Middle East have reignited concerns about a potential rebound. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that, as a rule of thumb, every $10 increase in oil prices can add approximately 0.2 percentage points to the inflation rate. He also emphasized that the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates, preferring to wait for more data to assess the broader economic impact of tariffs and inflationary pressures.

Amid rising costs for essentials such as food, housing, and energy, apparel stands out as one of the few categories experiencing outright price declines. This deflationary trend may signal a broader consumer pullback. According to LSEG Retail Index data, the apparel sector is on track to post the weakest earnings growth in 2025. Brands caught between rising production costs and softening demand are increasingly turning to discounting strategies, an approach that risks eroding both margins and brand equity.

Consumers are leaning towards healthier food options, and the rising inflation is also squeezing in on consumer spending, which has led to a slowdown in sales for the food manufacturing company.

Despite Kraft Heinz’s attempts to cater to the current consumer trends of healthier food by launching a zero-salt-and-sugar ketchup, the food brand is struggling to stay afloat amid rising competition.

The FMCG giant has reported a mixed financial performance in its most recent results, with its revenue going down for two years consecutively and lowering its future outlook.

Last week Kraft Heinz offloaded its Italian baby food business branch to New Princes in an acquisition worth €120m.

Willem Brandt, Kraft Heinz president of Europe and Pacific Developed Markets, said that the decision was due to the FMCG brand’s strategy to “fuel investment and growth in our core areas” while investing in growth of long-term value.

(Nasdaq: KHC) is exploring the breakup of its business operations, considering spinning off grocery brands into a separate company worth as much as $20 billion, the Wall Street Journal said Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The plan would separate many traditional Kraft-branded products into a new public company. This would allow Kraft Heinz to focus on faster-growing segments like sauces and condiments, including its flagship Heinz ketchup, as the food giant seeks to reverse years of declining sales.

Shares rose 2.5% Friday, giving the company a market value of about $31 billion. However, the stock has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since the 2015 merger that created Kraft Heinz.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said. The structure could change, and there’s no guarantee the company will proceed with any deal, the people said.

The potential breakup follows struggles with shifting consumer preferences toward fresher, less processed foods and mounting cost pressures. Net sales dropped 6.4% in the first quarter of 2025, while full-year 2024 sales declined 3%.

Kraft Heinz emerged from a 2015 merger orchestrated by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, which joined Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. The merger aimed to cut costs and boost profits, but has proven disappointing for Berkshire, which recently gave up its board seats.

CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera has acknowledged being “acutely aware of the building pressures across food,” including inflation and consumer anxiety affecting demand for the company’s packaged products.

The company recently announced it would eliminate artificial food coloring from US products by 2027, responding to health officials’ concerns about synthetic dyes.

It has also signed a deal with Yahoo DSP, allowing Yahoo’s customers to target Costco’s members across the the open web.
Through partnerships like this, Costco’s retail media network extends beyond physical stores to digital environments.
Brands can engage Costco members across instore displays, Costco.com and offsite digital channels, creating a seamless advertising experience.","Costco, the third largest retailer in the US with $250bn in global sales in 2024, is rapidly developing a retail media network built on its unique membership model and robust first-party data.

Costco is a membership warehouse club, dedicated to bringing members the best possible prices on quality brand-name merchandise. With more than 900 locations worldwide, it provides a wide selection of merchandise, plus the convenience of specialty departments and exclusive member services, all at a bargain price.

With this captive and data rich audience, Costco has started to embrace what it can do with retail media, specifically instore as that is where the bulk of all its sales still take place.

Unlike many competitors, Costco’s approach to retail media is rooted in its core value proposition: enhancing member experience and loyalty, rather than simply maximising ad revenue. This network is still in its early stages – still beta testing in late 2024 – but is poised to become a formidable player in the retail media landscape, leveraging both instore and digital touchpoints.

Costco’s greatest asset is its 80 million US cardholders, all of whom must use their membership cards for purchases. This creates a closed-loop environment, enabling Costco to link every transaction to a specific household and build detailed shopper profiles. Advertisers can then target audiences such as “Frequent Shoppers”, “Tenured Shoppers” and “Category Shoppers” using behavioural and purchase data to deliver highly relevant campaigns.

Already, Costco is expanding both instore and offsite media capabilities. Instore, advertisers can expect targeted signage, sampling events and digital displays, all informed by member data. Offsite, Costco has begun running campaigns with CPG partners on third-party media channels, achieving two to three times the typical return on ad spend in early tests.

It has also signed a deal with Yahoo DSP, allowing Yahoo’s customers to target Costco’s members across the the open web. Through partnerships like this, Costco’s retail media network extends beyond physical stores to digital environments. Brands can engage Costco members across instore displays, Costco.com and offsite digital channels, creating a seamless advertising experience. The Yahoo partnership also enables integration with Yahoo ConnectID, allowing for future-proof identity solutions and advanced measurement infrastructure.

Advertisers receive robust analytics and closed-loop measurement across this whole omnichannel portfolio of retail media, tracking campaign performance and sales impact within Costco’s audience segments. This transparency is a major draw for brands seeking to connect media spend to actual purchase behaviour.

With its membership driven data – which gives a uniquely rich dataset for ad targeting – Costco has been a late arrival in retail media, however this ‘last to market’ approach is also an advantage. The company is focused on building out infrastructure and capabilities over a multi-year roadmap, prioritizing data foundations and merchandising collaboration. It has also watched and learned from its competitors and, despite not actively pitching to agencies, Costco sees strong inbound interest from suppliers and brands. However, its limited product range compared to mass retailers may constrain the number of advertisers, ensuring campaigns remain highly relevant to members.",https://internetretailing.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Costco-Mike-Mozart-15410820046_7323e12d40_k.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:19:58.596618

Naturally, the discussion turned to how much the building might rent for on Airbnb.
It wasn’t a serious idea, but it also wasn’t a radical one—Airbnb once offered an overnight stay at the Louvre, and another at the Musée d’Orsay.","You are an entrepreneur who has achieved the impossible. You have disrupted an entire sector of the economy and practically invented a new one. Most startups fail, but you have built yours into a billion-dollar company—a genus so scarce that it’s called a unicorn. Your brand has become a transitive verb. What do you do now? Stop growing? Stop disrupting? Of course not. Winners don’t quit. They find new ways to win.

Brian Chesky, the co-founder and C.E.O. of Airbnb, was in SoHo the other day, standing near the cash register at the Housing Works Bookstore. In addition to being a forty-three-year-old multibillionaire, he is among the swolest of the swole C.E.O.s, with a swoop of dark curly hair and lats that make Jeff Bezos look like a featherweight. There was a steady rain, but Chesky walked outside in pleated slacks and a form-fitting T-shirt, risking his suède Celine sneakers. “Unlike a lot of tech companies, our business exists in the real world,” he said. “To launch something the right way, you need to get out into the community.”

He was starting what he called “the next chapter of the company, an evolution I’ve been thinking about for a long time.” (Wired: “Airbnb Is in Midlife Crisis Mode.”) Since 2007, travellers have been able to Airbnb a place to stay; now they can also Airbnb a Service (haircut, massage) or an Experience (cooking class, Jet Ski outing). Chesky was in SoHo to have an Experience.

He had just arrived from California, where he lives alone (when he’s not renting out his guest room on the app). Next, he was on his way to Paris, Berlin, Milan, Rome, Seoul, and Tokyo, sampling new wares along the way. The Experiences section of the Airbnb app was still in beta mode, and the New York selection was slim (“Make beats with a New York DJ”; “Catacombs by Candlelight”). Chesky was going on a walking tour of SoHo, focussed on architectural photography.

“I’m out in these streets in all kinds of weather,” the photographer Ethan Barber, who was leading the tour, said. “The only compromise I’ll be making today, because of the rain, is I’ll be shooting iPhone-only.” Walking backward, his glasses fogging, Barber headed to the first destination, a cast-iron building on the corner of Prince and Greene. He was used to leading groups, but this one was a private demo for Chesky. Chesky, however, travels with an entourage: press attachés, a couple of executives, and a guy named Chase, whose job is to fill Chesky’s social-media accounts with humanizing photos of the boss. A black S.U.V.—driver, plus private security—kept pace with the group.

Someone handed Chesky an umbrella; he waved it off, walked half a block, then changed his mind and took it. At the first stop, Barber pointed to the building—a French Renaissance landmark from 1883, now a Ralph Lauren store—and located his favorite spot to shoot from, marked by a wad of chewing gum ground into the sidewalk. Chesky stood next to the gum, finished tapping out a text, then held his iPhone in landscape mode and took a few snaps of the building while Chase took snaps of him.

“This could be cool,” Chase said, reviewing a moody black-and-white shot of Chesky. “Not for grid, but for Stories, maybe.”

Chesky went back to texting, and Barber moved along—to an Isabel Marant store on Broome and then to a former Isaac Mizrahi warehouse at 102 Wooster. Between texts, Chesky continued his pitch for the Airbnb redesign. “Most apps want you down here, in the phone,” he said, bending his neck down. “Our purpose”—head up, shoulders back—“is to get you out and about, making memories.”

The final stop was a walk-through of an artist’s foundation. Two women guiding the tour asked the guests to refrain from indoor photography. Everyone complied, except Chesky, who may or may not have heard the instruction. “I’m redoing my house, and I would be so into a wood floor like this,” he said, taking a video and sending it to his designer. “I want it to have that artist feel.”

Throughout the space, there were places for the artist to rest—a daybed, an East African headrest, a wooden platform holding two mattresses and a sculpture. Naturally, the discussion turned to how much the building might rent for on Airbnb. It wasn’t a serious idea, but it also wasn’t a radical one—Airbnb once offered an overnight stay at the Louvre, and another at the Musée d’Orsay. This building could be similarly enticing, the group mused, if not even more so. One of the curators said, with a tight smile, “Thanks, but it’s not available.” ♦

Supply of labour expands at steepest rate since November 2020

Permanent placements drop at fastest pace in 22 months

Pay growth weakens for perm and temp staff

Data collected 12-24 June

Summary

Uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June, according to the latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global. Permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Steeper reduction in recruitment activity in June

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

Candidate supply expands at fastest pace since late 2020

The overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Steeper decline in overall vacancies signalled

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Slower growth in starting salaries and temp wages

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

Regional and Sector Variations

Permanent placements fell markedly across all four monitored English regions in June, with the steepest decline seen in the South of England.

Apart from a fractional rise in the Midlands, the decline in temp billings was broad-based and led by the South of England.

Retail saw by far the steepest reduction in demand for permanent staff across the eight job categories that posted a decline. The only sectors to record an increase in permanent vacancies were Construction and Engineering, though upturns were only mild overall.

Six of the ten broad job sectors monitored by the survey registered lower demand for temporary workers in June. The sharpest drops were signalled for Retail and Secretarial/Clerical roles. Construction recorded the strongest growth, experiencing a renewed and solid increase in vacancies.

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring. But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering - which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery. The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”",,N,,2025-07-14 13:35:22.468302

It took Welch's Fruit Snacks 10 years,Mark Wilson,,,,,https://www.fastcompany.com/91367059/how-hard-is-it-to-remove-artificial-dye-from-food-it-took-welchs-fruit-snacks-10-years,"Today, the company is announcing that it’s removed all artificial dyes from its “mixed fruit” Welch’s Fruit Snacks, with the remainder of its portfolio transitioning next year.
As of today, a simple Welch’s Fruit Snack is a portrait of our complex global industrial supply chain.
The other unique challenge facing Welch’s is that this fruit creates acidity, and acids, too, will break down natural colors.
The tests involved dozens of different natural dyes to find those that worked best.
“Scientifically there will never be complete parity between artificial and natural colors,” Ramani concedes.","American food is about to look a little bit duller, but that’s probably for the best.

Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. introduced a ban targeting eight synthetic dyes in processed food, Kraft Heinz and General Mills have both committed to removing them across all their product lines by the end of 2027 in what will be the most significant ingredient shift in the processed food industry since the ban of trans fats in 2018.

But PIM Brands—makers of Welch’s Fruit Snacks, the top seller in its category worldwide—posits that this transition may be harder than it looks, at least if companies want to protect the bright color experience of their products.

“It would be darn impossible, in my opinion, to just snap your fingers and say, ‘Okay, we’re gonna make everything better in the next year or two,” says Michael Rosenberg, president & CEO of PIM Brands. “I think Americans are just a little bit more aggressive and punchy and just want to visually enjoy their products.”

It’s a challenge of both consumer expectations around product consistency, but also, in terms of human perception: Bright colors can actually make things taste sweeter or skew our tastebuds in other ways.

Today, the company is announcing that it’s removed all artificial dyes from its “mixed fruit” Welch’s Fruit Snacks, with the remainder of its portfolio transitioning next year. But the road to get here was anything but quick or easy for the company—despite having its own food science team in-house.

Instead, it’s been a 10-year process, the company says, adding that it couldn’t have possibly reacted rapidly to the demands of the new administration.

“It happens that all this coalesced just as the MAGA movement was really intensifying, but that’s just pure coincidence,” says Rosenberg. “Because we started working on this before any of this ever was even on anybody’s radar screen.”

The challenge of natural dyes

The big truth about dyes is that they make up very little of the food we eat—maybe 0.5% of a Welch’s Fruit Snack is added color by volume, according to Bhavna Ramani, chief R&D and production officer of PIM Brands. But their use has still prompted legitimate health concerns from researchers. The synthetic dyes used in the U.S. aren’t actually banned in Europe, but since 2010 manufacturers have had to place a warning label on foods in the region using them. Manufacturers have tried to avoid using these warnings, so their versions of products like Fruit Loops often eliminate artificial dyes and appear duller as a result.

The Welch’s team tracked these concerns a decade ago, and began a plan to transition its product. Its challenges ranged from feasibility (how do you source a color as rare as blue?) to its own scale—the company’s own color suppliers couldn’t meet their demand.

As of today, a simple Welch’s Fruit Snack is a portrait of our complex global industrial supply chain. The majority of its ingredients are a real fruit puree that match the flavor they’re advertising. That means for a strawberry snack, the company uses strawberries rather than defaulting to cheaper ingredients like apples and pears and supplementing flavor with extracts. But these fruits generally don’t supply the amount of color to which artificial dyes have accustomed us: peach, for instance, would be but the faintest shade of orange without dye.

Welch’s approach means that it already sources 30 different fruits from countries around the globe, tracking seasonal produce worldwide so that it can constantly produce all of its flavors of fruit snack. “When it’s hot in one place, it’s cold in another,” says Rosenberg. “So we’re really traversing the globe for our raw materials.”

Shifting to natural dyes meant shifting from a synthetic supply chain, derived from abundant petroleum, to a complex global footprint with similar problems to Welch’s primary fruit sourcing.

advertisement

Imagine that you need a certain fruit to source a certain color. If it’s grown in China instead of India, it will be different due to the climate and terroir. Each fruit’s hue could shift alongside ensuing chemical differences. That means fruits sourced from two different parts of the globe for color need to be constantly rebalanced and mixed appropriately to control each shade. Furthermore, those natural ingredients come with added concerns around contamination and food safety that don’t accompany their sterile synthetic counterparts.

Any color but brown

Making matters tricker is that processed foods add dyes in part because they oxidize, turning food brown over time. That’s specifically a concern for Welch’s, which are mostly oxidation-prone fruit that’s been stabilized in gelatine (which is less color-dependable than drier processed foods due to its water content). The team clarifies that not all products are as tricky to update with natural dyes as their own product—Ramani notes that hard candies, for instance, should be much easier, as desiccant sugars and corn syrup keeps colors more stable. The other unique challenge facing Welch’s is that this fruit creates acidity, and acids, too, will break down natural colors.

Each different color—like the yellows in its orange snacks, and the reds in its strawberry—had to be developed on its own. The company also created a new, proprietary process to add its natural dyes to its puree on the assembly line at a precise moment, using just the right method—and it updated its own packaging to tweak the exchange of oxygen.

Even still, to validate each color, they didn’t want to simply simulate the effects of heat or humidity. So they created the snacks and let them sit on the shelf, analyzing them each month for 18 months to see if the color shifted. The tests involved dozens of different natural dyes to find those that worked best.

“There were times where we’re at, you know, six months, seven months, and we didn’t like the way the color had held up,” says Ramani. “And so then we got to start over again, right back at one month.”

Yellow was the first color Welch’s solved—in 2015, concerns of yellow dyes spiked with research linking them to cancer triggers—and in what the team deemed to be relatively easy fix, it replaced its synthetic yellow with turmeric and annatto (both popular natural yellow dyes Kraft used to update their macaroni and cheese around the same time).

Its other colors are only coming to market now and over the next several months. The new red is made from purple carrot, red grape, and anthocyanins. Of all of the colors, its most difficult update was blue. Despite it filling our oceans and sky, blue is actually one of the world’s rarest colors. The company found its solution in South America’s huito fruit, which looks something like jackfruit crossed with a lime, but develops blue tones when exposed to air. Alongside a little spirulina, it created just the right color.

Trying the new version

After hearing so much about Welch’s commitment to a perfect color switch, as I open two packs of Welch’s Fruit Snacks side-by-side—one with artificial dyes and one with natural—I am surprised that I can definitely see a difference, as can my kids (who do both partake in Welch’s now and again). The naturally dyed snacks are undeniably less saturated, with slightly less rich reds and oranges.

“Scientifically there will never be complete parity between artificial and natural colors,” Ramani concedes. “We conducted side-by-side visual and sensory panels internally and externally . . . most consumers either couldn’t tell the difference, or preferred the new colors knowing they came from natural sources.”

If I weren’t looking at them side-by-side, I’d never know myself. But I do swear the new snacks taste a little less sweet. It’s something my son notes, too, unprompted and unaware of research pointing out just this phenomenon. If we were blindfolded or in a dark movie theater, would we have noticed? We’d need to set up a larger blind taste test to know.

That said, there is no shortage of sweet treats on the market if your only concern is a sugar blast. And as a consumer who has loathed unnecessary artificial dyes for years—perhaps the one health topic on which RFK Jr and scientifically minded liberals agree—I’m only more likely to buy Welch’s now. And watching my kids eagerly nosh on my remaining press samples, it doesn’t seem they’re sweating the changes, either.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91367059-welchs-natural-colors.jpg",N,,2025-07-14 08:09:17.431266

Nike is said to be focusing on different sports categories across its various brands, including Nike, Jordan, and Converse.

The brand has been grappling with slower sales growth and increasing competition within the global market recently.

In its fourth-quarter revenues of fiscal 2025, Converse recorded a 26% decrease in sales, amounting to $357m on both reported and currency-neutral bases. The brand also saw a 19% drop in annual revenue to $1.7bn, with an 18% decline on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues at Nike fell 10% to $46.31bn in FY25.

These challenges have led to cost-cutting initiatives and a strategic shift towards performance-oriented sports products.

Carver’s tenure at Converse spanned 15 years and included key leadership positions in North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Cain, who has been with Nike for over two decades and currently serves as vice president and general manager of Nike Global Men’s, is set to assume his new responsibilities after a transition period concluding at the end of July.

Cain’s appointment follows a broader series of executive reshuffles at Nike.

In May this year, the company promoted Amy Montagne, Global Women’s VP/GM to president at Nike.

Phil McCartney, formerly VP of Footwear advanced to EVP, chief innovation, design and product officer.

Chief marketing officer Nicole Graham was also promoted to EVP, chief marketing officer to lead Nike, Jordan and Converse.

Tom Clarke, the strategic advisor to the CEO, transitioned into the role of chief growth initiatives officer.

In May, Nike president and CEO Elliott Hill said: “I’m confident that with this new structure and leadership team in place we will be able to better line up and leverage all the advantages that make Nike great.

Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods. News of the potentially impeding breakup was reported July 11 by The Wall Street Journal.

Under the plan, several Kraft products would be spun off into a new entity, and the remaining company would produce and market a portfolio focused on condiments and sauces, including the Heinz brand, the Journal said.

In response to an inquiry from the publication, a Kraft Heinz spokesperson said, “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

The May remarks by Carlos Abrams-Rivera, chief executive officer, prompted speculation Kraft Heinz would shed businesses. Robert Moskow, an analyst with TD Cowen, wrote at the time the announcement meant some businesses would be divested, adding, “We, too, believe KHC should slim down its portfolio.”

In November 2021, the company sold portions of its cheese business to the Lactalis Group and Emmit Roth USA Inc.

The July 2015 merger of Heinz and Kraft was accompanied by considerable investor enthusiasm. Heinz had been acquired two years earlier by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway in a $28 billion deal, a transaction that appeared highly successful before the Kraft merger. Meanwhile, the Kraft grocery business had been separated in 2012 from its snack foods brands (mostly Nabisco), a business that was renamed Mondelez International.

While the Kraft Heinz combination appeared to go well briefly, sales and profits began flagging within a couple of years. Numerous efforts since then have failed to reignite growth. The company’s share price (adjusted for subsequent dividends) recorded its highest monthly close in May 2017 at $63.44 and has not returned to that level since.

The entire system can run on power generators, battery backup systems, or traditional power sources, making it incredibly useful in remote locations, including forward operating bases and disaster zones. By integrating HP’s industry-leading 3D printing technology, xCell enables the production of mission-critical components and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in real-time, at the point of need.

Firestorm’s vision is to create a distributed, resilient global production network where customers can leverage regional and localized supply chains to adapt to shortages, deliver products more quickly, and flexibly develop needs-based modifications to products with long lead and shipping times. 3D printing is uniquely and supremely suited to distributed, flexible, and elastic production, which solves a broad range of logistical challenges, including contested logistics.

“This agreement is a game-changer,” said Ian Muceus, Co-Founder and CTO of Firestorm. “For nearly a decade, we’ve trusted HP’s technology to meet high-volume, high-quality demands of polymer additive manufacturing. Now, we’re able to take that capability directly to the edge—military bases, disaster zones, and remote medical outposts—where time and logistics matter most. HP has built an incredibly mature ecosystem of equipment that supports the print process, and this collaboration is going to take everything to the next level. We’re excited to keep pushing boundaries, fine-tuning print settings, developing new materials, and maximizing throughput, material properties, and lightweighting.”

HP’s François Minec, VP & Global Head of Sales and Business Development at HP Additive Manufacturing Solutions, echoed the excitement for the collaboration, adding, “This isn’t just about best-in-class 3D printers. It’s about empowering first responders, aid organizations, and military units with the ability to manufacture solutions wherever they are. We’re excited to help build a future where distributed, on-demand production becomes the norm and makes a difference in people’s lives. Our vision is to empower businesses and communities with scalable, localized production that enhances efficiency, reduces waste, and provides critical solutions when and where they’re needed most.”

The collaboration also signals an investment in workforce development, creating new high-tech jobs in system operations and maintenance, field deployment, and drone manufacturing and assembly. Firestorm’s expanding ecosystem will require skilled technicians, engineers, and logistics experts to support the growing demand for mobile manufacturing solutions.

Together, Firestorm and HP are redefining how the world thinks about manufacturing, shifting from static supply chains to dynamic, in-situ production that’s fast, resilient, and scalable. Expeditionary 3D printing makes that possible, letting organizations create and modify exactly what they need, responsively and scalably.",https://uasweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mobile_Multi_jet_fusion_additive_Manufacturing.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:09:20.912484

It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.
In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.
ArcelorMittal South Africa will release its half-year financial results on July 31.","(Reuters) -Talks with the South African government have so far yielded little progress to avert the closure of loss-making long steel operations at ArcelorMittal South Africa, the company said on Monday.

The South African unit of world number two steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA initially said in November 2023 it planned to close the two plants, citing weak domestic demand, high electricity tariffs, poor freight logistics and competition from local scrap metal recycling mini-mills and imports from China.

""Regrettably, limited progress has been made to date in redressing the major structural impediments,"" ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a trading update. It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

South Africa's trade and industry minister Parks Tau told lawmakers on July 4 that the government was in ""firefighting mode"" as it tries to avoid the closure of ArcelorMittal's operations in KwaZulu Natal and near Johannesburg.

The closure of the plants, which supply rail, roads and bars to the construction, mining and manufacturing sectors as well as components for the automotive industry, has been deferred twice as the company and the government sought to save the 3,500 jobs directly under threat.

In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.

Imports have flooded the domestic market, taking up more than 35% of local steel demand, while freight rail service ""deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk,"" the steelmaker's statement said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa expects to report a headline loss per share between 0.89 rand and 0.99 rand ($0.0498-$0.0554) for the six months to June 30, narrowing its loss from 1 rand per share during the same period last year.

Sales volumes declined by about 10% in the first half of 2025 compared to last year, the company said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa will release its half-year financial results on July 31.

This ended a five-quarter sequence of expansion in new business and is most likely a reflection of the uncertainty that changing US trade policy is causing.
On a more positive note, all three sectors that make up business activity, were in expansion mode in Dublin in Q2 2025.
The rise in staffing levels in Dublin was softer than in the Rest of Ireland (52.2).
The Overall PMI is based on the output/business activity question from each survey.","The latest PMI survey from S&P Global, shows that business activity in Dublin’s private sector increased in the second quarter of 2025, albeit at the softest rate of expansion since late 2023.

The headline rate stood at 52.2, broadly in line with the 52.6 seen in the previous quarter. Crucially this remains above the 50-point mark that denotes expansion. At 52.6 output across the rest of Ireland increased in line with that in Dublin.

The Capital’s New Orders component contracted for the first time since Q4 2023. It dropped 2.1 pp from the first quarter of the year to 49.9 indicating a marginal contraction. This ended a five-quarter sequence of expansion in new business and is most likely a reflection of the uncertainty that changing US trade policy is causing. In contrast, new orders across the Rest of Ireland expanded to 53.0, up from 52.7 last quarter.

On a more positive note, all three sectors that make up business activity, were in expansion mode in Dublin in Q2 2025. The Manufacturing sector (54.2) showed the strongest rate of growth which was particularly notable as it bounced back from a contraction of 48.9 last quarter. Both the Construction (55.8) and Service (50.3) sectors posted increases in activity but at slower rates than seen in Q1 when they were at 57.8 and 53.4 respectively. Similarly, the Rest of Ireland saw increases in activity in all sectors; Manufacturing (53.4), Service (53.0) and Construction (50.4).

Continuing the trend seen since the opening quarter of 2021, employment increased in the latest three-month period. The modest pace of job creation (51.3) was fractionally quicker than in the opening quarter of 2025 (51.2). The rise in staffing levels in Dublin was softer than in the Rest of Ireland (52.2).

Commenting on the PMI, Andrew Harker, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said:

“It was good to see a return to growth in manufacturing production in Dublin, which meant that all three monitored sectors contributed to the overall expansion in business activity seen in the second quarter of the year. Overall, however, the picture was quite subdued, with little movement in new orders during the quarter meaning that firms increased their output and employment only modestly. With US trade policy potentially becoming clearer soon, the Dublin private sector is at something of a crossroads as we enter the second half of the year. We will hopefully see a demand environment more conducive to growth in Q3.”

The legislation introduces stricter work verification requirements for Medicaid recipients in states that expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, requiring proof of employment every six months starting in 2026 or 2027. Experts warn this will overwhelm state Medicaid departments already operating with limited staff and resources.

The bill’s changes may lead to mass disenrollments, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting 7.8 million people could lose coverage by 2034. The process is expected to begin in 2027. This poses a challenge for insurers, as the remaining enrollees are likely to be sicker, increasing healthcare costs and shrinking profit margins. States may also reduce payments to insurers due to federal funding cuts, further tightening margins.

Companies like Centene and Molina, which have significant exposure to Medicaid, could be more impacted than those with diversified portfolios like Aetna and UnitedHealthcare. Insurers may respond by exiting less profitable states, focusing on strongholds with scale, or adjusting plans to retain healthier members. Strategies may include enhanced benefits such as transportation services, social support programs, and perks to make plans more attractive.

Despite the increased administrative burden and financial pressure, some insurers may aim to retain coverage by working closely with federal and state partners.

The joint membership program also sets up a two-way incentive mechanism: Starbucks members can receive 100 Eastern Airlines miles after activation, while Eastern Airlines members can receive a Starbucks gift star.
In terms of accelerating consumption, Starbucks Diamond members can earn 1.5 times Eastern Airlines points reward when purchasing tickets through Eastern Airlines' direct channels; meanwhile, Eastern Airlines platinum, gold, and silver card members can also enjoy 1.5 times star rewards for their consumption at Starbucks.
Meanwhile, Eastern Airlines has long been deeply engaged in Yunnan, possessing extensive route coverage and targeted support experience.","On July 14, Starbucks China announced a comprehensive collaboration with China Eastern Airlines (hereinafter referred to as ""Eastern Airlines""). This partnership not only covers the integration of the joint membership system but also extends to three major areas: co-creation of Yunnan coffee, co-creation in cultural tourism, and co-creation in sustainable development, marking Starbucks China's outstanding innovation in value-based experiences.

""Creating a higher quality 'Star-style life' for our members has always been Starbucks' unwavering pursuit. By partnering with Eastern Airlines, we are bringing our members a completely new 'in-air' experience,"" said Liu Wenjuan, CEO of Starbucks China. ""In the future, whether they are in the clouds or strolling through the city, they will gain a familiar and definitive sense of value.""

Currently, competition in the Chinese coffee market is becoming increasingly intense, and consumer attention is constantly diverting. This move once again demonstrates Starbucks' confidence and determination in deepening its presence in the Chinese market: adhering to a 'long-termism' strategy that focuses on the customer and relies on value-based experiences, to create a higher quality and more valuable 'Star-style life' for Chinese consumers. A cup of coffee is no longer just a medium for functional consumption, but an emotional symbol of a continuous connection between the brand and its users.

Exploring value co-creation under the 'Coffee Journey Model'.

A cup of coffee during travel has become part of modern living. As representative companies deeply focused on user experience in their respective fields, Starbucks and Eastern Airlines have joined forces, with the core focus on building a joint membership system, integrating the Star Enjoy Club and Eastern Airlines’ Wanlihang Club’s membership systems to explore multi-dimensional value co-creation under the 'Coffee Journey Model'.

Members of different tiers from both parties can now initiate the 'Coffee Journey Model', enjoying an exclusive experience covering the full chain of ""membership binding, consumption points, and flight"". For example, on the day of flight travel, Starbucks Diamond Joint members can enjoy free in-flight Wi-Fi, while Eastern Airlines Platinum and Gold Joint members can receive a complimentary medium drink at airport stores without the need to redeem stars or points.

The joint membership program also sets up a two-way incentive mechanism: Starbucks members can receive 100 Eastern Airlines miles after activation, while Eastern Airlines members can receive a Starbucks gift star. In terms of accelerating consumption, Starbucks Diamond members can earn 1.5 times Eastern Airlines points reward when purchasing tickets through Eastern Airlines' direct channels; meanwhile, Eastern Airlines platinum, gold, and silver card members can also enjoy 1.5 times star rewards for their consumption at Starbucks. Members at other levels can receive additional star incentives by meeting spending thresholds within a limited time.

This mechanism not only bridges the membership path between the airline travel and coffee scenarios but also enhances the flexibility of point usage and the perception of the value of membership rights. Unlike traditional shallow collaborations across brands, the 'Coffee Journey Model' emphasizes multiple consumption touchpoints before, during, and after the flight, creating an integrated life chain of 'Coffee + Airline Travel' value co-creation, further enhancing the continuity and stickiness of brand interactions.

This cooperation will also extend to three key co-creation directions, reflecting both parties' innovative exploration around 'value-based experiences' and promoting the transformation of functional consumption into a value-based experiential form that carries more emotional warmth and cultural connections.

First is Yunnan coffee co-creation, where Starbucks and Eastern Airlines have natural synergy in Yunnan. Since establishing its first Asia-Pacific coffee grower support center in Pu'er in 2012, Starbucks has continuously promoted the high-quality development of Yunnan's coffee industry through open-source agronomy support, premium price procurement mechanisms, and brand empowerment. Meanwhile, Eastern Airlines has long been deeply engaged in Yunnan, possessing extensive route coverage and targeted support experience. In this cooperation, the two sides will jointly launch 'Yunnan Coffee Themed Flights' to allow travelers to deeply experience the unique Yunnan coffee culture through multiple forms such as cabin decorations, coffee tastings, film screenings, and themed gifts during the flight.

Secondly, in terms of cultural and tourism co-creation, relying on Starbucks’ network of over 7,700 'third space' stores across the country and Eastern Airlines' deep layout in 'aviation + local' cultural and tourism resources, both parties will jointly create culturally distinctive tourism products and service experiences that enrich the cultural content and emotional value during consumers' travels, thereby promoting local cultural and economic development.

In terms of sustainable development co-creation, both parties adhere to a shared environmental protection philosophy and practice, and will jointly launch a 'Green Flight' project that encourages more customers to participate in green and low-carbon actions, collectively injecting more energy into a sustainable future. Starbucks' long-term investment in eco-friendly packaging and green store operations, combined with Eastern Airlines' aviation experience in energy saving and carbon reduction, will provide solid support for this plan, collaboratively promoting the implementation of green concepts in the travel and consumption chain.

'Coffee +' empowers the membership system, enhancing emotional stickiness.

'Coffee + Airline Travel' cooperation is not only a functional commercial collaboration but also reflects the deep synergy between both parties in brand values, user needs insights, and ecological co-building capabilities. Through this cooperation, Starbucks no longer provides services solely in the 'coffee scenario' but further integrates into a broader life journey, continuously enhancing the brand's cultural connectivity and emotional penetration beyond functional value.

In fact, this innovative exploration is another key initiative for Starbucks to continuously deepen the value of its membership system. Since the launch of the Star Enjoy Club in 2011, this membership system has become an important connecting bridge between the brand and consumers. In June of last year, the Star Enjoy Club membership system underwent a comprehensive upgrade, enhancing exclusivity and participation through the addition of Diamond Star membership levels, a new star redemption mechanism, and gameplay. The upgraded system not only enhances the personalized dimension of user experiences but also becomes a key carrier for Starbucks to build 'value-oriented consumption.'

Meanwhile, Starbucks accelerates its cross-scenario ecological layout, relying on system upgrades to 'break the circle' for the first time in collaboration with Hilton Group to launch a 'Coffee + Hotel' joint membership program, integrating multiple unique benefits that connect travel and daily consumption scenarios.

Data shows that since the upgrade in 2024, the registered members of the Star Enjoy Club have grown from 0.13 billion to 0.16 billion, with a steady increase in loyal members. Among them, the number of active members within 90 days has surpassed 20 million, and the membership sales contribution rate has reached 75%. These numbers reflect not only the emotional stickiness users have towards Starbucks but also demonstrate the strategic value of its membership system in promoting long-term user engagement.

Faced with the common pressure of a 'price war' in the coffee industry, Starbucks consistently chooses 'value' and 'experience depth' as its core competitiveness, and through cross-border collaboration, scenario extension, and membership system upgrades, it continues to empower member rights, expanding the depth and density of user touchpoints, injecting new connotations into its brand moat in the battle for existing customers.

From beverage innovation to spatial resonance, continuously expanding the boundaries of the 'Star' lifestyle.

In addition to the continuous optimization of the membership system, Starbucks' deepening of user value is also reflected in its collaborative layout across three aspects: products, spaces, and cross-content, presenting a strong focus on consumer needs, experience optimization, and an emphasis on local cultural integration.

At the product level, in April of this year, Starbucks officially launched the 'True Taste Sugar-Free' innovative system. This is the result of several months of work by Starbucks China, involving 74 rounds of sensory flavor testing and more than 40 versions for development and iteration, capable of completely separating the flavors and sugars in the original flavored syrups while satisfying consumers' health and sugar reduction demands without sacrificing flavor. As a trial product of this system, the Starbucks Rose 20 and Jasmine 100 series received positive market feedback shortly after their launch in the first quarter, validating the user acceptance of the innovative path.

Customization has always been a very unique beverage customization play for Starbucks, and it has become an important way to establish interaction between the brand and its customers. Consumers can freely combine different sweetness, milk bases, tea bases, and flavor ingredients according to their personal preferences, creating 'their own cup.' This flexibility not only increases customer engagement and fun during ordering but also gives rise to 'secret menus' on Social Media, becoming a source of inspiration for product innovation. The previously popular Hongcha Yuanyang Latte and Fully Iced Americano hidden hits, for instance, are 'Star-style' plays widely communicated by customers that ultimately feed back into the permanent menu, forming a two-way co-creation mechanism between the brand and consumers.

The launch of the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' innovation system further expands the combination space, achieving over 500 different flavor and sweetness pairing options, which undoubtedly enhances the breadth and depth of the customization dimension.

In addition to coffee Ontology, Starbucks is also accelerating the expansion of 'non-coffee' scene layouts to meet consumers' diverse beverage needs throughout the day and across multiple scenarios. In June of this year, Starbucks proposed the consumption rhythm of 'morning coffee, afternoon non-coffee' for the first time, strengthening the three flagship categories of Frappuccino, Iced Shaken Tea, and Tea Latte. In fact, these three categories have already accumulated a stable consumer base due to their unique characteristics, with significant growth potential. Among them, Frappuccino is particularly popular, serving as the 'entry choice' for many non-coffee drinkers to experience Starbucks and is also the mainstay of summer sales. In this push, Starbucks is more leveraging the launch of the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' innovative system to create a certain price space, encouraging more customers to explore customization play.

On the basis of product innovation, Starbucks also actively responds to the current trend of 'emotional consumption' by co-creating cross-industry content, strengthening the emotional connection between the brand and consumers. This year, Starbucks China has collaborated with IPs such as Snoopy and Disney, launching a series of themed beverages, including three iced shaken teas inspired by the three main characters of 'Zootopia.' At the same time, the brand invited Mayday to serve as summer ambassadors, creating a communication bridge that aligns with the cultural interests of younger demographics. Fans of Mayday have also utilized the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' system to independently customize the 'Bubu Frappuccino,' which has gradually become a 'beverage code' among communities, further deepening emotional identification and participation with the brand.

The rich customization options help consumers escape the monotonous consumption experience, while store space serves as an important interface for the brand to reach users, becoming a cultural field that enriches the 'Star-style life.' Starbucks has always emphasized the localized expression of the 'third space,' avoiding template replication and continues to actively promote the deep expansion of high-quality, localized stores in recent years.

From the Ningbo Dongqian Lake Taolu Street Store 'in the village' to the 'highest altitudinal' store in Yunnan's Yulong Snow Mountain, and then to cultural tourism landmark stores in Jiuzhaigou, Dunhuang, and Zhangye, Starbucks, through localized 'third space' design and site selection strategies, enhances cultural locality and the brand's presence in urban life. This 'non-standardized' spatial layout not only boosts social attributes but also constructs a deeper cultural resonance between the brand and consumers.

Essentially, Starbucks is no longer just a coffee brand in the Chinese market, but is building the ""Star-style"" lifestyle it advocates—a framework of experiences that can be extended, iterated, and embedded into consumers' daily life scenarios. From drink flavors to service scenarios, from the memberships system to cross-border collaborations, Starbucks revolves around ""people"" in its business logic, emphasizing a sense of ""value"" rather than ""price"", offering long-term service that accompanies rather than a one-time Trade conversion.

In an increasingly competitive and rational market environment, the contest of brand power is no longer limited to the product itself, but rather to its ability to position itself within diverse life scenarios, shaping lasting and rich user relationships. Starbucks China is continuously validating this proposition through the ""Coffee+"" model: a cup of coffee is not just the starting point of consumption, but also the entry point that connects lifestyle, cultural identity, and even value choices.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/20220801035174077aff53868dc.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 09:08:34.551260

At ETBrandEquity's Brand World Summit 2025, marketing leaders unveiled the shift in live entertainment during an intriguing panel discussion. The statistics are nothing short of revolutionary - over 30 million Indians attended live events in 2024, a jaw-dropping three-fold increase from 2019. The live entertainment industry is set to explode, projected to surge from ₹12,000 crore to ₹23,000 crore by 2030.

This is a cultural metamorphosis reshaping how brands connect with audiences. The constellation of marketing leaders who decoded this phenomenon during the panel ""Live Events Unleashed: What CMOs Make of Concert Crazy Indians"" moderated by Anirban Chowdhury, senior assistant editor,The Economic Times revealed insights that are transforming the marketing landscape entirely.

Chandrika Jain, CMO, Lenovo India who sees technology as the heartbeat of culture. ""Technology isn't just a tool; it's the very DNA of modern culture,"" she proclaimed during the discussion. Her 'Brave New Art' initiative has already captured 10 million organic views, proving that creativity knows no boundaries. Her most profound insight resonates throughout the industry: brands must breathe the culture they want to inhabit rather than merely observe it from the outside.

The approach taken by Shantanu Gangane, senior director- integrated marketing experience, Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia, demonstrates how brands can become cultural anthropologists. ""We don't just support events; we create cultural moments that become generational memories,"" he explained to the assembled marketing leaders. Coca-Cola's Coke Studio isn't just a music platform - it's evolved into a cultural institution that has fundamentally redefined musical collaboration in India, bridging generations and musical traditions.

Vineet Sharma, VP marketing , AB InBev, views live events through an entirely different lens - one that places fans at the absolute centre. ""We're not selling a product; we're crafting experiences that become lifelong memories,"" he shared with the audience. Budweiser's strategy transcends traditional beer marketing; instead, the brand creates immersive narratives that resonate deeply with young India, from NBA collaborations to music festivals that become cultural touchstones.

Fashion intersects with this live entertainment revolution in fascinating ways, as Amit Kothari, head of marketing, H&M eloquently demonstrated. ""Fashion is a language of self-expression,"" he noted during the panel discussion. For H&M, a concert isn't merely an event - it transforms into a runway of personal storytelling where brands become enablers of individual creativity, allowing people to express themselves with joy, positivity, and confidence.

Understanding Generation Z proves crucial to this transformation, as Akanksha Dalal, marketing director, Mountain Dew, PepsiCo, clearly articulated. ""This generation doesn't just consume content; they want to be part of the narrative,"" she observed. This insight reveals why brands that don't evolve risk becoming cultural footnotes, as Gen Z demands authentic, immersive experiences rather than passive consumption.

What truly transforms these events from mere concerts to cultural phenomena is the alchemy of music, fashion, technology, and genuine human connection. Brands are no longer passive observers but active creators of experiences that resonate on multiple levels. These events have become platforms for self-expression, cultural exchange, and brand storytelling, where concerts serve as canvases for brands to paint their narratives.

Infrastructure remains a significant challenge as these experiences aim to go mainstream. The journey from niche to mass market requires breaking down multiple barriers, with accessibility becoming paramount for widespread adoption. However, the ROI paradigm has shifted fundamentally - success isn't measured in sales alone anymore but calculated in cultural capital, social media engagement, and brand perception. Metrics have become more nuanced, more human.

As India's live entertainment industry strikes its crescendo, brands are discovering that the sweetest melodies emerge when they become part of the symphony rather than merely conducting from the sidelines.

Why it matters: It's the Seattle-based coffee giant's latest play to win back customers and reverse sliding sales.

Under CEO Brian Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, the company has been making a series of tech-forward and consumer-focused changes.

Starbucks leans into TikTok trends

The big picture: This initiative draws a direct line from social media to the Starbucks app — a strategy familiar to Niccol and Tressie Lieberman, Starbucks' global chief brand officer, from their days at Chipotle.

In 2023, the fast-casual chain introduced three menu items based on TikTok users' personalized orders.

How it works: Starting Monday, Starbucks Rewards members can browse a selection of custom drink creations inspired by customer hacks and social media trends in the app's ""Offers"" tab.

With one tap, a pre-built custom drink is added to the cart with all modifications preloaded, which simplifies ordering, the company said.

Zoom in: The first four customizations featured are:

Cookies on top: A Cold Brew with vanilla syrup, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam and cookie crumble topping.

Dragonfruit glow-up: A Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade Refresher blended with peach juice and topped with Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam.

Just add white mocha: Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso with White Chocolate Mocha Sauce and Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam.

What's next: More customizations will be featured in the future on the app's offer tab, Starbucks said.

Starbucks Secret Menu Contest

State of play: Starbucks is also running the ""Secret Menu Contest"" Monday through July 20. Customers and employees can submit their drink customizations at secretmenucontest.starbucks.com.

The entries will be narrowed down to four final beverage customizations, and public voting will be held on Starbucks Instagram Aug. 18-20.

The finalists' creations will be featured on the app from Aug. 18-25.

Each finalist wins $5,000, and the fan-voted grand prize winner gets an additional $25,000.

However, the structure of the deal could change and there is no guarantee Kraft Heinz would move forward with any such deal, the source said.

News of the potential move is the second effort this week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier this week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a $3.1 billion buyout deal from Italy’s Ferrero.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the development earlier in the day.

According to the report, a split, which would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, could be finalised in the coming weeks.

A company spokesperson said, “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

Its shares closed up 2.5%.

The company currently has a market value of $31.33 billion.

‘Echoes The Kelloggs Spinoff’

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with HJ Heinz, which they bought in 2013.

But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for Kraft Heinz’s lunch combos and other products.

It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the US after health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

Analyst at Consumer Edge Conor Rattigan said, “KHC spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kelloggs spinoff in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time.

“As CPGs (consumer packaged goods makers) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to M&A and/or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory.”",https://img.resized.co/checkout/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA1XFxcLzE3MTYzNjAxXFxcL0hlaW56XzM2Mjg1NzI3X20uanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5jaGVja291dC5pZVxcXC9pXFxcL25vaW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjFlMzIxMDc5N2MxODk3NDExYmQwYzYxMzUyYmU4YTk4YjNhNjk5NmQifQ==/kraft-heinz-explores-grocery-business-spinoff-worth-up-to-20bn-checkout.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 09:07:54.623776

A Checklist for Supply Chain Leaders To avoid being caught off guard during peak season, supply chain leaders must act now.","As summer heats up, supply chain leaders are already bracing for the year’s holiday season. From warehousing and logistics to production and fulfillment, every link in the chain must operate at peak performance. But amid the rush to secure seasonal labor and optimize operations, one critical question often goes overlooked:

Do you have the right supervisors in place to lead your teams through the busiest time of the year?

The Hidden Weak Link in the Supply Chain

Research from Express Employment Professionals and The Harris Poll reveals a growing crisis in middle management that’s already straining supply chain performance. Supervisors, the essential bridge between frontline workers and upper management, are burning out, stepping down, or opting out of leadership roles altogether.

55% of supervisors have quit or plan to quit due to a lack of fulfillment or advancement.

33% cite mental health challenges as a reason for leaving.

Younger workers are increasingly rejecting management roles, citing high stress and low reward.

In supply chain environments, where precision, speed, and coordination are non-negotiable, the absence of experienced supervisors can lead to costly disruptions, including missed deadlines, safety incidents, increased turnover, and reduced throughput.

Training Gaps Are Fueling the Fire

Many companies assume they’re preparing supervisors for success, but the data tells a different story. While 86% of hiring managers believe their supervisors have the tools they need, only a fraction offer training in the areas that matter most, such as conflict resolution, emotional intelligence, and providing constructive feedback.

This disconnect is particularly hazardous in supply chain settings, where supervisors must manage diverse teams, resolve real-time issues, and maintain morale under intense pressure. Without proper training and support, even the most capable supervisors can quickly become overwhelmed, leading to burnout, disengagement, and operational breakdowns.

The Cost of Turnover in Supply Chain Roles

When a supervisor leaves, the impact ripples across the entire operation. Productivity drops. Safety risks increase. And the cost of replacing that leader, often 50% to 200% of their annual salary, can be staggering.

In fact, one in five hiring managers say turnover costs their company up to $100,000 per year. In logistics, manufacturing, and distribution, where margins are tight and timelines are critical, such disruptions can derail an entire season.

A Checklist for Supply Chain Leaders

To avoid being caught off guard during peak season, supply chain leaders must act now.

Based on insights from Express franchise owners nationwide, here’s what companies should prioritize to prevent supervisor burnout and turnover:

Set Clear, Reasonable Expectations—Define realistic goals and workloads.

Enforce Time Off—Encourage supervisors to take real breaks to avoid burnout.

Use Contract Workers—Bring in temporary help to manage seasonal spikes.

Train for Real-World Leadership—Focus on conflict resolution, communication, and team management.

Build Peer and Mentorship Networks—Create support systems for supervisors.

Recognize Effort, Not Just Outcomes—Celebrate leadership behaviors, not just KPIs.

Give Supervisors More Autonomy—Empower decision-making on the floor.

Invest in Mental Health Resources—Offer counseling and stress management tools.

Cross-Train Teams—Share responsibilities to reduce pressure on any one role.

Simplify Admin Work—Cut back on busywork that distracts from leadership.

The potential spin-off comes as Kraft Heinz seeks to address persistent challenges in its grocery segment, which has struggled to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences.
Reports suggest that the spin-off would allow Kraft Heinz to retain its core brands, such as Heinz ketchup, Grey Poupon mustard and a range of sauces, while divesting traditional grocery items like boxed dinners and processed cheese.
Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.
Despite initial optimism surrounding the merger, Kraft Heinz has faced significant hurdles, including inflationary pressures that have negatively impacted demand for its products.","According to reports from major media outlets, including Bloomberg and Financial Times, Kraft Heinz Company is actively considering a significant restructuring that would involve spinning off a substantial portion of its grocery business, which includes several iconic Kraft products.

Sources familiar with the company's situation indicate that this new entity could be valued at as much as $20 billion. However, the exact structure of the deal remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that it will be finalised.

The potential spin-off comes as Kraft Heinz seeks to address persistent challenges in its grocery segment, which has struggled to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences.

The company has been under pressure from shareholders to enhance value, particularly as economic conditions prompt consumers to seek more affordable options and healthier alternatives.

This exploration follows a similar move by WK Kellogg, which recently agreed to a $3.1 billion acquisition by Ferrero, indicating a trend of consolidation in the food sector.

Reports suggest that the spin-off would allow Kraft Heinz to retain its core brands, such as Heinz ketchup, Grey Poupon mustard and a range of sauces, while divesting traditional grocery items like boxed dinners and processed cheese.

Such a separation could potentially position the remaining business for faster growth, capitalising on the increasing consumer demand for condiments and sauces over processed meal solutions.

As of now, Kraft Heinz's market capitalisation stands at approximately $31.33 billion, and the company's shares closed up 2.5% following the news of the potential spin-off.

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital. Despite initial optimism surrounding the merger, Kraft Heinz has faced significant hurdles, including inflationary pressures that have negatively impacted demand for its products.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace.
Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.","Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

Last year, the company introduced a DCS Card that lets users instantly convert stablecoins into Singapore dollars.

With users demanding real-time, borderless payments, Leng thinks digital and decentralised solutions will continue to reshape the way money moves.","A stablecoin conversion card offers a bridge between crypto and cash.

DCS Card Centre Pte. Ltd is embracing digital asset innovation as superapps, fintechs, and blockchain technology transform the payment landscape.

“The broader payment ecosystem is undergoing a rapid shift in standards, and that is very much propelled by the rise of digital banks and fintechs,” Dayna Leng, chief marketing officer at DCS Card Centre, told Asian Banking & Finance.

Leng noted that the shift isn’t limited to traditional financial institutions.

“They're all coming up with super apps—proprietary wallets like ShopBack Pay, Shopee Pay, GrabPay, and BNPL (buy now, pay later) options even in nonfinance apps,” she said via video teleconference. “All of this is moving towards creating this new level of standard for financial institutions.”

DCS, formerly Diners Club Singapore, has expanded beyond issuing credit and charge cards to include broader payment solutions and, more recently, Web3 services.

Last year, the company introduced a DCS Card that lets users instantly convert stablecoins into Singapore dollars. This means customers can spend their digital assets directly, while merchants still receive payment in fiat currency.

“For Web3 community [members] who really want to have cash on hand from the stablecoins that they owned, they can do that through a physical card,” Leng said. “They can withdraw from the ATM.”

She said the payment space is now more fluid than ever, as digital tools blur the lines between traditional finance and decentralised systems.

“We have gone from debit to credit to mobile to digital, from operating within the traditional finance ecosystem to dual real payments across both [traditional finance] and Web3 economies,” Leng said.

This shift includes programmable tokens—smart contracts that make payments automatically when certain conditions are met. Banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and DBS Bank Ltd. are exploring this, and Leng sees it as a step toward better system integration.

“All in all, the interoperability between economies will continue to grow,” she said. “Consumers can expect better transaction speed and more optimal cost.”

But as digital payments grow, strong regulations are needed.

“Everything needs to be regulated first,” Leng said, She added that the digital payment landscape will evolve, but institutions should ensure it stays responsible.

DCS is entering Web3 to stay relevant as the payment landscape rapidly changes. With users wanting fast, borderless payments, Leng believes digital and decentralised tools will keep changing how money moves.

An accordion facility of £800m is also being made available to help drive CityFibre’s continued expansion through the acquisition of full fibre network assets. This facility will be used to finance the company’s M&A pipeline and cement its position as the sector consolidator.

Greg Mesch, CEO of CityFibre, said: “This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre’s next phase of growth, as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network, for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

“There is huge opportunity ahead for CityFibre and it is testament to the success of the company that we have such strong backing from our lenders and shareholders. This multi-billion-pound investment into critical digital infrastructure will deliver significant benefits across the UK, helping to realise potential and unlocking economic growth.”

This investment marks a significant moment in upgrading the UK’s digital infrastructure. It will deliver world-class infrastructure and services to millions of consumers and businesses and provide the digital foundations for the UK’s economic growth for decades to come.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said: “Today’s announcement shows Britain is attracting billions of pounds of investment, including through the National Wealth Fund, driving growth across British businesses.

“Investing in our digital infrastructure is key to ensuring our economy is fit for the future. Through our Plan for Change we’re growing the economy by boosting investment in Britain and working hand in hand with businesses to create jobs, to put more money in working people’s pockets.”

Secretary of State for Technology, Peter Kyle said: ""This investment in CityFibre is welcome news. It's proof our telecoms industry is driving investment into the UK, as well as building the digital foundations that will serve generations to come.

“The success of the UK's network providers will help accelerate the rollout of gigabit-capable broadband to millions of homes and businesses across the country. I hope to see even more success stories like this one, because this sector is critical not just to improving internet speeds, but to transforming quality of life for communities and creating opportunities in every part of the country as part of our Plan for Change.""

Over the past 12 months, CityFibre has announced its first full year of profitability1, launched Sky’s full fibre and Gigafast+ services across CityFibre’s nationwide network, completed the integration of Lit Fibre, announced the acquisition of Connexin’s full fibre infrastructure2 and reached more than 4.5 million premises with its full fibre network, over half way to CityFibre’s milestone of 8 million premises.

However, the structure of the deal could change and there is no guarantee Kraft Heinz would move forward with any such deal, the source said.

News of the potential move is the second effort this week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier this week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a $3.1 billion (€2.7 billion) buyout deal from Italy's Ferrero.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the development earlier in the day. According to the report, a split, which would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, could be finalised in the coming weeks.

""As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,"" a company spokesperson said.

Its shares closed up 2.5%. The company currently has a market value of $31.33 billion (€26.82 billion).

A Challenging Investment

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for Kraft Heinz's lunch combos and other products. It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the US after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

""KHC spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spinoff in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,"" said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.

""As CPGs (consumer packaged goods makers) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to M&A and or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory,"" Rattigan said.",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA1XFxcLzEwMTQxMDM0XFxcL0tyYWZ0X0hlaW56XzgzMDUyNjExX20uanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltZy5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI5ZTUxMGYyMTBmZTNjYmI0N2RmN2E4MjUwZDIzMjk4ZGFkZGQwODhkIn0=/kraft-heinz-explores-grocery-business-spinoff-worth-up-to-20bn-source-says.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 06:06:52.216030

In commemoration of their annual social responsibility week, AXA Week for Good, hundreds of the company’s employees visited various schools across Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, educating students and teachers on the identification, prevention, and reporting of sexual and domestic violence.

AXA Week for Good is the flagship volunteering programme of AXA Hearts In Action (AHIA), a programme through which AXA encourages its employees to contribute to positive societal and environmental impacts through volunteering, expertise, related financial support, and in-kind donations.

Through the AHIA, our employees do not just give time to great causes; we work together for a better future. We share our knowledge and expertise as a people with a shared purpose of acting for human progress by protecting what matters by helping vulnerable communities and people around us, said Rashidat Adebisi, Chief Client Officer, AXA Mansard.

Under the theme “Being a Girl Shouldn’t Be A Risk,” AXA Mansard employees participated in awareness walks to sensitize the public about the danger of domestic and sexual violence on children and the nation’s future.

According to Adebisi, this theme presents the organization with an opportunity to demonstrate the social, economic, and ethical benefits of protecting the girl child. She said Nigeria’s 105 million children and adolescents aged 0–17 years represent about half of the country’s population.

For a country betting its economic growth on the strength and human capital of its young population, the alarming rate and spate of Violence Against Children (VAC) threaten the future not just of our country, but of the African continent.

She noted that the staggering reality that 60% of Nigerian children experience one or forms of violence before age 18 is a call to action for everyone, and our employees are responding to this clarion call so that the thousand of Nigerian girls who go through physical, emotional, sexual and psychological violence can find safe places to get help; but most important, we can rid our society of perpetrators, she furthered.

Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley reacted positively to Rose's appointment after WPP announced the news on July 10.
We have and continue to build market-leading AI capabilities, alongside an unrivalled reputation for creative excellence and a pre-eminent client list.
WPP has the most brilliant, talented, creative people, and I can't wait to write the company's next chapter together.”","Martin Sorrell, founder and executive chairman of S4 Capital, has said that WPP may be “too far gone” for incoming chief executive Cindy Rose to have the effect needed to turn around the business.

The founder and former CEO of WPP, who has previously advocated for the sale of the holding company’s media arm WPP Media (then known as Group M), again raised the question of whether or not WPP may be “better off” breaking down its units to sell them off, criticising outgoing CEO Mark Read’s leadership over the past seven years.

Speaking to Campaign, he said: “Cindy Rose’s operating experience at Disney, Vodafone and Microsoft may be stellar and she may be very talented, but the question is whether the business is too far gone as a result of the approach of the last seven years and would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.”

The market cap of rival Publicis is now four times the size of WPP and WPP issued a profit warning for Q2, revising its full year revenue forecast to a decline of between 3% and 5%.

Sorrell quipped: “I’m sure John Wren [the CEO of Omnicom], with 20:20 hindsight, would have preferred to acquire WPP rather than IPG. In any event, the jury is out.”

Primarily, Sorrell added, WPP “needs leadership, a new strategy and a clear structure” to rival the “clear strategy around digital, data and media and a country-led structure”, which, according to him, Publicis has.

Rose, he continued, fits the criteria sought by WPP chairman Philip Jansen, but, he noted, she will have to “be located in, and 24/7 laser-focused on, the US, undoubtedly the centre of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralised”.

The US was among the first of WPP’s markets to face job cuts as part of the restructure of Group M and employees were disgruntled earlier this year by Read’s return-to-office mandate.

Sorrell expressed scepticism over agencies’ ability to build software-as-a-service type businesses, as WPP is attempting to do with Open, in competition with companies like Adobe, which are already dedicated to such a set-up.

He also pointed to client and talent losses as the result of the ""collapse"" of brands, including Wunderman, J Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as a cause for concern.

He said: “WPP has spent over £1.5bn over the last five years below the headline operating profit line on mostly cash restructuring charges and built up multiple levels of overhead at group, sub-group and company levels.

“Under the guise of simplification, the leadership has collapsed storied brands such as J Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, Wunderman, Grey, Hill&Knowlton, losing not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.”

WPP has been approached for comment.

Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley reacted positively to Rose's appointment after WPP announced the news on July 10. However, they flagged up her lack of experience in capital markets and within ad agencies.

Jansen praised Read for his “tireless commitment” and “progress he has made to modernise, simplify and transform the company over the last seven years as CEO” in the statement to the stock market about Rose’s appointment.

She was also optimistic about the agency group's future: “WPP is a company I know and love — not only from my six years on the board [as a WPP non-executive director] but as a client and partner for many years before that — and I couldn't be happier or more excited to be appointed as CEO.”

Rose added, “There are so many opportunities ahead for WPP. We have and continue to build market-leading AI capabilities, alongside an unrivalled reputation for creative excellence and a pre-eminent client list. WPP has the most brilliant, talented, creative people, and I can't wait to write the company's next chapter together.”",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2f20250714015938_Untitled+design+(2).png&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 05:04:10.635547

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels. This follows US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on the European Union. The EU is a major trade partner for the US. The EU is delaying retaliatory tariffs. They hope to reach a trade deal with the US. Negotiations will continue. The EU is also exploring new markets.

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement of 30% tariffs on the European Union.

The EU is America's biggest business partner and the world's largest trading bloc. The U.S. decision will have repercussions for governments, companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

""We shouldn't impose countermeasures at this stage, but we should prepare to be ready to use all the tools in the toolbox,"" said Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, told reporters ahead of the meeting. ""So we want a deal, but there's an old saying: 'If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.'""

The tariffs, also imposed on Mexico, are set to start on Aug. 1 and could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the U.S., and destabilize economies from Portugal to Norway.

Meanwhile, Brussels decided to suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month.

Live Events

The ""countermeasures"" by the EU, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries, will be delayed until Aug. 1.

Trump's letter shows ""that we have until the first of August"" to negotiate, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday.

MaroS Šefčovič, the EU's trade representative in its talks with the U.S., said negotiations would continue

""I'm absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,"" he told reporters in Brussels on Monday.

""I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.""

The letters to the EU and Mexico come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade.

Trump imposed tariffs in April on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, he began sending tariff letters to leaders, but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks.

If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.

In the wake of the new tariffs, European leaders largely closed ranks, calling for unity but also a steady hand to not provoke further acrimony.

Just last week, Europe was cautiously optimistic.

Officials told reporters on Friday they weren't expecting a letter like the one sent Saturday and that a trade deal was to be inked in ""the coming days."" For months, the EU has broadcast that it has strong retaliatory measures ready if talks fail.

Reeling from successive rebukes from Washington, Šefčovič said Monday the EU is ""doubling down on efforts to open new markets"" and pointed to a new economic agreement with Indonesia as one.

The EU top brass will visit Beijing for a summit later this month while courting other Pacific nations like South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia, whose prime minister visited Brussels over the weekend to sign a new economic partnership with the EU. It also has mega-deals in the works with Mexico and a trading bloc of South American nations known as Mercosur.

While meeting with Indonesia's president on Sunday, Von der Leyen said that ""when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together.""

ID23,Kraft Heinz,2025-07-14 07:55:24+00:00,Trellis,How Credo Beauty created new plastic from old bits of packaging - Trellis Group,Elsa Wenzel,,,,,https://trellis.net/article/how-credo-created-new-plastic-from-old-bits-of-beauty-packaging/,"The San Francisco nonprofit has gathered 140 cosmetics makers and retailers — including Sephora, Ulta Beauty and L’Oréal — to attack small-format plastic waste.
Credo Beauty, a founding member of Pact, then used that resin, called NewMatter, to create recyclable pumps for its moisturizer bottles.
The making of the NewMatter pump “We used NewMatter resin for the pump because we wanted to show that beauty packaging can be made from beauty waste,” said Ross of Credo.
“This is a really high value source of plastic.” One pound of plastic waste stays out of landfills or oceans for every 38 pumps that Credo makes, according to Pact.
Next steps Beyond the pump, Pact also turned recycled high-density polyethylene into soap dishes with Terrazzo-like flecks in them.","Less than 10 percent of single-use plastic is recycled, most of it bottles and jugs. That rate is far lower — close to zero, in fact — for smaller bits and pieces of packaging such as bottle caps, straws and coffee pods.

In the cosmetics industry, for example, few of the 120 billion units of lotion pumps, mascara wands and other components made each year are recycled, according to the Pact Collective.

The San Francisco nonprofit has gathered 140 cosmetics makers and retailers — including Sephora, Ulta Beauty and L’Oréal — to attack small-format plastic waste. Pact maintains more than 3,300 bins for spent makeup jars, lids and applicators at North American stores including Nordstrom Rack and Saks Fifth Avenue.

To further its mission, the collective created something new from nearly 232 tons of detritus it has collected since 2022. Last year, as its collection volumes tripled, the organization transformed piles of plastics into a novel resin.

Credo Beauty, a founding member of Pact, then used that resin, called NewMatter, to create recyclable pumps for its moisturizer bottles. Those pumps usually blend several types of plastic with a metal coil, which prevents its recycling. Credo, however, used a single material — polypropylene — to make it easier to recycle later. Now that it has cracked this challenge, Pact seeks to encourage investors and infrastructure builders to support systems to collect, sort and recycle more small-format plastics.

“As the first beauty retailer to co-create a recycled resin from hard-to-recycle empties, we saw an opportunity to show circularity at work,” said Christina Ross, head of science and impact at Credo Beauty, a founding member of the Pact Collective. “This pump became a proof point and we can’t wait to see what brands do with the material next.”

Banding together

As international negotiations continue on a global plastics treaty, Pact isn’t the only corporate collaboration trying to keep packaging components out of landfills and incinerators. In February, the Consortium for Small Formats launched with backing from L’Oréal Groupe, Kraft Heinz and P&G. Individual brands’ efforts at circular packaging include refill programs from the likes of Kiehl’s and customer collection programs run by nonprofit Terracycle for Sephora and MAC.

Members of the U.S. Plastics Pact, meanwhile, have focused on sweeping benchmarks for reducing the proliferation of petroleum-based plastics, but their 2025 and 2030 deadlines are slipping out of reach.

“We are taking a different angle,” said Pact Collective Executive Director Carly Snider. “We’re collecting this material and then proving that it has value.” The initial heavy lift shows that certain cosmetics plastics can be integrated into municipal recycling systems, she added. “I’m hopeful that we can have this case study to show that this material has value, and therefore it’s worth the investment to your infrastructure for us to collect this material curbside.”

Pact’s June 26 impact report described how Credo’s custom pump, announced in September, fit into a busy year of scaling up recycling. Ninety-eight percent of the paper, glass and metal collected by Pact has been recycled. So has 70 percent of sorted, clean plastics.

Retail collection bins are core to Pact’s mission to grow as a household name for consumers, three-quarters of whom care about sustainable packaging, according to the nonprofit. Pact also collected 88,959 pounds of industrial waste of returns and expired or damaged goods last year.

The making of the NewMatter pump

“We used NewMatter resin for the pump because we wanted to show that beauty packaging can be made from beauty waste,” said Ross of Credo. “No one had ever made a high-functioning component from post-consumer beauty packaging before, so we knew the road wouldn’t be easy but also that it mattered.”

The journey to make the recycled pump started as Pact’s consumer-and-industrial packaging streams shipped to a plant in Lake Zurich, Illinois. After being sorted into 14 categories, the would-be trash was sent to mechanical recycling partners.

Next, the plastic recycler shredded and turned the waste into pellets.

The recycler required some 40,000 pounds of incoming material, which Pact’s collections alone did not reach. Therefore, Credo’s fully polypropylene pump blended 84 percent of material from Pact’s collection bins with 16 percent ocean-bound plastic gathered by hand in Malaysia. “It took a lot of work with them to figure out ways that we can get this material in there,” Snider said. “This is a really high value source of plastic.”

One pound of plastic waste stays out of landfills or oceans for every 38 pumps that Credo makes, according to Pact.

Next steps

Beyond the pump, Pact also turned recycled high-density polyethylene into soap dishes with Terrazzo-like flecks in them. “It’s really creating a way that customers can hold circularity in their hands,” Snider said. “It’s not this abstract thing.”

Credo is exploring where else it can use NewMatter resin, such as closures and other components that tend to be hard to recycle.

“Now that the infrastructure is set up to use take-backs on a more circular level, we need to continue to create a demand for post-consumer beauty-grade materials,” Ross said. That includes exploring how extended producer responsibility regulations cropping up in multiple states can help brands to advance innovative packaging, she added.

With the acquisition of Employes, Ageras adds payroll software to its services in the Netherlands.
Ageras aims for more acquisitions Founded in 2012 by Rico Andersen and Martin Hegelund, Ageras operates a software platform that serves over 400,000 small businesses across Europe.
With more than 30 years of combined experience in building internet companies, the founders created Ageras to simplify administration for small businesses.
According to the CEO, Rico Andersen, Ageras plans to continue expanding through further acquisitions to grow its presence in the European market.","Copenhagen-based Ageras, a software platform for accounting, administration, and banking for small businesses, has acquired Amsterdam’s Employes, a payroll software company.

This is Ageras’s second acquisition in 2025 and its eighth overall. The company has expanded its operations in several European markets, including through the 2024 acquisition of Shine from Société Générale. With the acquisition of Employes, Ageras adds payroll software to its services in the Netherlands.

Rico Andersen, CEO and co-founder of Ageras, completed the acquisition of Danish payment reconciliation software company Storebuddy in 2025.

With the latest acquisition, Andersen says, “Employes is a perfect match for Ageras as they too believe in putting business owners first, and building a product that radically simplifies their administration.”

“The acquisition doesn’t just make our Dutch offering much stronger, but also gives us a proven, scalable platform to do even more with payroll – ultimately changing the way small businesses pay their wages and take the pain out of payroll. No doubt, this is our most significant acquisition since Shine joined us last year.”

Payroll administration, simplified

Founded in 2018 by Rob Kroezen and Marius van den Oever, Employes provides a platform that allows businesses in the Netherlands to manage payroll independently within the country’s regulatory framework.

Currently, the company serves over 6,000 businesses and is used or recommended by more than 300 bookkeeping firms.

Co-founder Rob Kroezen, who will stay on the combined journey with Ageras, says, “We started Employes because we were frustrated with how difficult payroll management was for small business owners. Joining Ageras gives us the scale, reach, and resources to bring our product to even more entrepreneurs, and we’re therefore very excited for what’s ahead.”

Ageras has acquired Employes as part of its expansion. Employes’ teams in Amsterdam and Zwolle will now join Ageras’ workforce of approximately 450 people, a number that increased during 2024.

Ageras aims for more acquisitions

Founded in 2012 by Rico Andersen and Martin Hegelund, Ageras operates a software platform that serves over 400,000 small businesses across Europe. With more than 30 years of combined experience in building internet companies, the founders created Ageras to simplify administration for small businesses.

The platform integrates invoicing, accounting, payroll, banking, and financing into one system, enabling business owners to manage their operations more efficiently. Ageras is backed by investors including Investcorp, Coller Capital, Lazard, Rabo Frontier Ventures (Rabobank), and Folketrygdfondet.

In its 2024 annual results, Ageras reported an EBITDA of €8.7M and revenue of €55.5M, reflecting a 114 per cent increase. According to the CEO, Rico Andersen, Ageras plans to continue expanding through further acquisitions to grow its presence in the European market.

Andersen says, “Small businesses across Europe are increasingly looking for all-in-one platforms to run their businesses. Payroll is a crucial piece of that puzzle, however, it does not conclude our vision to empower businesses everywhere to spend less time on admin and more time on what matters. Therefore, we will still be scouting the market for the right opportunities to arise in Europe.”",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Employes-co-founders-Marius-van-den-Oever-and-Rob-Kroezen-Image-credit-Employes.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:07.601062

“From a regional perspective, North America PC shipments declined 0.5% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the same time last year,” said Padhi.
“The total PC market in APAC remained flat year-over-year, which is a slight improvement after consecutive quarters of decline.
Meanwhile, the EMEA PC market grew 5.3% year-over-year.
Lenovo saw the strongest growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9% year-over-year.","Worldwide PC shipments totaled more than 63 million units in the second quarter of 2025, a 4.4% increase from the second quarter of 2024, according to preliminary results by Gartner, Inc.

Expert Take:

“In the second quarter of 2025, enterprise demand outpaced consumer demand, underpinned by Windows 11 migrations and pandemic-era desktop renewals, while consumer refreshes slowed as buyers deferred purchases,” said Rishi Padhi, Research Principal at Gartner. “PC shipments are forecast to rise 2.4% in 2025, propelled by a tariff-driven front-loaded inventory surge in the first half of 2025 in the U.S., and ongoing Windows 11 replacement cycles in the rest of the world. In the second half of 2025, shipment growth is expected to plateau as vendors draw down stock in response to demand, potentially creating excess inventory by year-end.

“From a regional perspective, North America PC shipments declined 0.5% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the same time last year,” said Padhi. “The total PC market in APAC remained flat year-over-year, which is a slight improvement after consecutive quarters of decline. Meanwhile, the EMEA PC market grew 5.3% year-over-year. This illustrates signs of a modest recovery and stronger-than-usual seasonal demand. The Windows 11 refresh cycle remains a key driver, particularly for desktop replacements. However, the expected surge in new device purchases has been subdued, as many organizations opt to update existing PCs to Windows 11 rather than invest in new hardware.”

There were no major changes in the top five vendor rankings worldwide in the second quarter of 2025 (see Table 1). Lenovo saw the strongest growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9% year-over-year.

The round includes £500m in new equity from shareholders, Infrastructure at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Antin Infrastructure Partners, Mubadala Investment Company and Interogo Holding.

CityFibre has also agreed a committed £960m expansion of its existing debt facilities, supported by lenders including ABN AMRO, BBVA, Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo IMI CIB, Lloyds, the National Wealth Fund, NatWest, SEB and Société Générale.

Rounding out the £2.3bn is a further £800m accordion facility to fund future acquisitions.

Greg Mesch, chief executive of CityFibre, said: ""This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre's next phase of growth as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

There are currently no legal requirements in the UK for businesses or organisations to accept cash.","Donald Trump has announced he will impose a 30% tariff on imports from the European Union from 1 August, reports Sky News. The tariffs could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the US. Trump has also imposed a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico, according to a post from his Truth Social account.

Meanwhile the EU’s retaliatory tariffs on US exports have been delayed again, reports the BBC. The countermeasures, which were due to start on Tuesday, came in response to US President Donald Trump’s initial import taxes on steel and aluminium. The EU’s retaliation, which would have hit € 21bn worth of US goods, was first suspended in March. This break has been extended until early August, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a press conference on Sunday.

Morrisons has told ‘idling’ shop floor staff they will no longer be allowed access to stockrooms as the supermarket races to boost customer service ratings, the Telegraph reports. The supermarket has written to staff saying that new restrictions will mandate which of them are allowed in backrooms, to ensure it had “the right colleagues in the right place to deliver the best service to customers at all times”. Only authorised managers and staff will be allowed to enter stores’ warehouse areas from August.

The Bank of England is ready to make larger cuts to interest rates if the jobs market shows signs of a pronounced slowdown, The Times reports. The governor of the bank, Andrew Bailey, told the newspaper there was “consistent” evidence of businesses “adjusting employment” after Rachel Reeves increased employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs). He said Britain’s economy was growing behind its potential, opening up “slack” that would help to bring down ­inflation, which is expected to rise above 3.4% when official figures for June are published this week.

Louis Vuitton has said the data of some UK customers has been stolen, as it became the latest retailer targeted by cyberattackers, reports The Guardian. The retailer said an unauthorised third party had accessed its UK operation’s systems and obtained information such as names, contact details and purchase history. The brand, which last week said its Korean operation had suffered a similar cyber-attack, told customers that no financial data such as bank details had been compromised.

The company behind brands including McVitie’s biscuits and Jacob’s crackers is to pump millions of pounds into its UK operations in an effort to “supercharge” growth, according to The Times. Pladis has revealed it will plough £68 million into its British business, with the bulk to be spent on its manufacturing sites in the northwest, including Stockport, Carlisle and Aintree. Pladis, which owns United Biscuits, said the cash would be used to increase capacity, capability and productivity by modernising infrastructure in its factories and launching more automated production lines.

Kraft Heinz, the US food group, is preparing to break itself up, spinning off a large part of its groceries business into a new entity that could be valued at as much as $20 billion, according to The Times. The remaining company would focus on its faster-growing sauces and condiments brands including Heinz Tomato Ketchup and the Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon.

The decision comes after the company in May said it was considering several options to reverse its persistent underperformance, reports the Financial Times. One of the plans being considered includes spinning off much of its traditional grocery portfolio.

Talks to rescue Britain’s biggest bioethanol plant are on a knife-edge after the government offered only a partial bailout focusing on the production of carbon dioxide used in fizzy drinks and to preserve food, The Times reports. Vivergo, which is owned by FTSE 100 company Associated British Foods (ABF), is set to close in two months unless a taxpayer rescue can be agreed.

More small businesses expect to downsize or shut up shop than grow over the next 12 months, reports The Times, citing a survey by one of the UK’s most influential trade bodies. Of those surveyed, 27% of owners expect their businesses to either close, shrink or be sold in the coming year, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Only 25 per cent believed their businesses would expand.

Britain’s heatwave is ‘burning the economy’, says a piece in The Telegraph, which begins by focusing on Rob Davies’ dairy and arable farm in Herefordshire. “Grass is a very important crop for us, and our grass yields currently are down by about 50pc,” says Davies. “Maize is also looking to be around 50% down.” His struggles are only one example of the many ways hotter temperatures are affecting Britain’s economy, with visits to shops down 1.8% last month.

Shareholders in the owner of Boots have voted overwhelmingly in favour of being taken over by an American private equity firm, creating uncertainty over the future of the high street pharmacy chain, according to The Times. About 96% of votes cast by shareholders approved the takeover of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) by Sycamore Partners in a $10 billion deal, a fraction of the $100 billion the US pharmacy chain was worth a decade ago.

A fried chicken war broke out in the UK after two American restaurant chains hired private detectives and lawyers to fight over Britain’s fast food future, according to the Telegraph. Legal papers seen by the newspaper reveal a bizarre battle in which lawyers grappled with the popularity of “Southern comfort food” and even asked whether “James Bond could become obsessed with Nashville hot chicken”. The dispute was triggered by a “cult” American fast food chain’s recent expansion into the UK to meet the nation’s growing appetite for fatty foods.

The boss of the pub chain Greene King has called for changes to business rates to remedy “unfairness” that he said added to financial pressures on the struggling pubs industry, according to The Guardian. Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive, said the business rates system of property taxes should be changed to a tax on profits. The trade body the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said last week it expected pub closures at a rate of more than one a day during 2025.

Pubs are struggling to turn a profit despite the sunny weather as Labour drags its heels on tax reform, reports the Daily Mail. Drinkers are flocking to beer gardens for a pint but industry leaders say business rates mean takings are being drained away – despite pledges by Labour to change the system. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has piled on further pain with a rise in employer national insurance contributions that took effect in April.

Manufacturing output across all UK regions is back above pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The Times cites a report published on Monday from the manufacturing lobby group Make UK and accountants BDO which underlines the bounce-back from Covid, when grounded airlines, a lack of demand and supply chain disruption brought some factories.

The boss of coffee giant Lavazza has said hedge funds are to blame for pushing up the price of a morning brew, according to the Daily Mail. Giuseppe Lavazza said speculation by the big financial firms was responsible for the vast majority of the surge in prices on wholesale coffee bean markets. He said: ‘Hedge funds are really big players and they make a lot of difference, especially in the volatility of the market and the uncertainty of the market.’

The Bank of England will monitor the use of cash payments amid fears that vulnerable groups risk being excluded, the Telegraph reports. Threadneedle Street officials are set to intervene after MPs warned more checks were needed to ensure people can still pay with cash in public places, such as coffee shops, leisure centres and on public transport. There are currently no legal requirements in the UK for businesses or organisations to accept cash.

Wimbledon has experimented with creating a mocktail in the style of Pimm’s, in response to growing demand for alcohol-free options at the championships, according to The Guardian.

One option on the table for the group is a separation of the groceries part of its portfolio, containing the ready meals and processes cheese products, from the more lucrative sauces and condiments operation, including the Heinz brand.

The potential move comes a decade after Warren Buffett and 3G Capital merged Heinz and Kraft, and it follows an announcement in May that the group was considering a number of options to turn around its performance.

Executives at Kraft Heinz expect splitting the group up will create two companies worth more than the current group market value of $31bn, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal, which first covered the story.

A split could be finalised within the coming weeks but the board has yet to make a final decision, according to people involved in the discussions. There is a still a possibility assets will be sold off instead, with the group remaining as one entity.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” the company told The Financial Times. “Beyond that, we do not comment on rumours or speculation.”

Kraft Heinz’s history as a combined group has been rocky since the 2015 mega-merger, with a hostile $143bn takeover attempt fought off by Unilever in 2017.

India is believed to have doubled crude liftings, partly as a signal to US policymakers amid trade pressures.","New data from S&P Global Commodity Insights cited quoted by Indian media outlets, India has sharply increased its crude oil imports from the United States and Brazil in the first half of 2025.

US crude shipments to India rose 51% year-on-year to 271,000 barrels per day between January and June, up from 180,000 bpd a year earlier, while imports from Brazil surged 80% to 73,000 bpd, compared to 41,000 bpd during the same period in 2024. These were the highest growth rates across India’s import portfolio, underscoring a decisive pivot toward Western Hemisphere barrels.

The increase follows multiple converging developments. India’s state-run refiners have sought to insulate procurement from OPEC+ volatility and disruptions in the Middle East. Reduced Chinese liftings of US crude opened spot-market opportunities, while freight rates from the Atlantic Basin fell, improving arbitrage economics.

Diplomatic engagement also played a role. Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri met with Brazilian energy officials earlier this year, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Washington visit in April included energy cooperation as a key agenda item.

Russia retained its top position with 1.67 million bpd in H1 2025, though growth plateaued. Iraqi and Saudi volumes declined marginally, while Nigerian shipments rose 26% to 158,000 bpd.

The Fair Work Commission (FWC) earlier this month ordered 18 South Australian franchisees of McDonald's to negotiate employee pay and conditions under the government's bargaining reforms.
Gerard Dwyer, National Secretary of the SDA, said the nationwide application is the ""logical next step"" after the success of the SA case.
Willox warned that the application to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers.
""Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission,"" he said.","The Shop, Distributive, and Allied Employees Association (SDA) has lodged an application to extend the bargaining orders to McDonald's franchisees nationwide after a landmark win in South Australia.

Gerard Dwyer, National Secretary of the SDA, said the nationwide application is the ""logical next step"" after the success of the SA case.

""That ruling by the Fair Work Commission confirmed what was always obvious: that McDonald's stores, whether franchisees or corporate – share common interests and that workers should be able to bargain together,"" Dwyer said in a statement.

Dwyer added that it is clear that workers should be able to bargain for improved wages and conditions.

""In short, these young, low-paid workers – many in their first jobs – should be able to say: 'I'll have bargaining with that,'"" he stated.

'Sadly inevitable escalation'

The Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) said the union's win in SA ""emboldened"" it to bargain for a multi-employer agreement across all McDonald's restaurants nationwide.

""The SDA application represents a dramatic and sadly inevitable escalation of the Government's multi-bargaining laws across the economy, well beyond what the Government suggested would occur when it pushed through the laws in late 2022,"" said Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox in a statement.

Willox warned that the application to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers.

According to Willox, the development could expose other employers across the fast-food, retail, hospitality, and numerous other sectors to the risk of being drawn into multi-employer bargaining.

""Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission,"" he said.

""Australian Industry Group urges the Federal Government to introduce urgent amendments to the Fair Work Act to tighten up the scope of the supported bargaining stream, and to address the unintended consequences reflected in the FWC's decision.""

The new ""Strato"" from Starbucks aims to stand out with a layer of cold foam with flavors, according to The Street.
For many consumers, Starbucks becomes the easiest and most reliable option.
With its new Strato Frappuccinos already in stores, Starbucks seeks to attract its most loyal audience again.
The brand is betting on strengthening its leadership in the competitive market for cold and sweet drinks in the United States.","In many cities across the United States, it's easy to notice the dominance of large chains. Small family businesses have closed or have been absorbed by giants. The pandemic accelerated this process and completely changed the commercial landscape up to the present day.

Now, Starbucks announces a move to further consolidate its position. The coffee chain is launching a special line of drinks for the summer, following the strategy of its competitors. On July 8, three new Frappuccinos arrived with a layer of flavored cold foam called ""Strato,"" available only for a limited time.

Starbucks bets on strengthening its presence

The company isn't unfamiliar with the tough competition in the sector. Although it has more than 200 locations just in Manhattan, where millions of tourists and workers pass through each year, it can't rest on its laurels. Starbucks has seen how brands like Chick-fil-A and Wendy's take advantage of the summer to attract customers with sweet and eye-catching new products.

Chick-fil-A, for example, has bet on peach drinks for the season. Wendy's isn't far behind and has launched the new Frosty Swirls with sweet syrups. Faced with this competition, Starbucks is strengthening its offerings to keep its image as the reliable and approachable brand that its customers know.

The new ""Strato"" from Starbucks aims to stand out with a layer of cold foam with flavors, according to The Street. Consumers will be able to choose between Salted Caramel Mocha, Strawberry Matcha, or Brown Sugar. The idea is to replace the classic whipped cream and give an innovative twist to the popular Frappuccinos.

An efficient business model

The success of Starbucks is based on convenience and customer trust. In its locations, consumers know what to expect. Its massive expansion strategy may seem costly or redundant, but it proves effective by ensuring a presence in almost every part of the city.

If one location is full, it's likely to find another just a few blocks away. This model ensures capturing the extra demand that would arise in other smaller coffee shops. For many consumers, Starbucks becomes the easiest and most reliable option.

However, the chain has had to face certain challenges after the pandemic. The return of customers to offices caused unexpected demand. At the same time, there were issues with staff turnover. To solve this, Starbucks has invested in its Siren system, which speeds up the preparation of complicated drinks, although these changes take time to implement.

With its new Strato Frappuccinos already in stores, Starbucks seeks to attract its most loyal audience again. It also wants to win over those looking for something different for the summer.

NOTE: CityFibre is owned by Antin Infrastructure Partners, Goldman Sachs, Mubadala Investment Company, Interogo Holding etc.
The facility will support their “continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers“.
CityFibre’s strategy around this thus remains somewhat unproven, and any new funding deal they strike now will be subject to less favourable conditions than they had before (e.g.
Put another way, this may not be the last funding deal they’ll need, which means that some of the same underlying funding challenges could still resurface again in the future.","Digital infrastructure builder CityFibre has today announced that they’ve reached a crucial UK funding agreement worth £2.3bn (mix of debt and equity). The deal will support the ongoing deployment of their new 10Gbps capable Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) broadband network and also drive a new wave of consolidation.

Just to recap. CityFibre has already deployed their full fibre network to cover around 4.5 million premises (inc. 550k customers) and they’ve long aspired to reach up to 8 million UK premises – representing c.30% of the UK. But their original target of hitting that by the end of 2025 will be missed, and they’ve also been facing some of the same pressures as many other networks (e.g. high interest rates, rising build costs and competition).

NOTE: CityFibre is owned by Antin Infrastructure Partners, Goldman Sachs, Mubadala Investment Company, Interogo Holding etc. The network is supported by UK ISPs such as Vodafone, TalkTalk, Zen Internet, Sky Broadband and more, but they aren’t all live or available in every location yet.

In response, the operator has already made some redundancies and shifted their strategy, which sees them focus less on new network builds and more on growth via mergers and acquisitions (M&A), as reflected by the deals to acquire Connexin (here) and Lit Fibre (here). Not to mention putting more effort into commercialisation in order to encourage take-up by consumers, which is where the recent deal with Sky Broadband may help (here).

According to industry analyst James Ratzer – in 2025 and beyond, it’s expected that CityFibre will likely only build FTTP out to c.300k homes per annum organically, largely to meet their state aid backed Project Gigabit contracts. But the operator still aspires to add around 1 million premises each year, which suggests c.700,000 will be coming from the acquisition of other networks; something they’ve been very vocal about (here).

However, the operator’s existing funding had nearly run out, and they needed more in order to deliver on both their existing network expansion and their new consolidation strategy. Suffice to say that today’s agreement is aimed at tackling both of those issues.

What’s in the funding deal

The new financing includes £500m in new equity secured from CityFibre shareholders – Infrastructure at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Antin Infrastructure Partners, Mubadala Investment Company and Interogo Holding.

On top of that, CityFibre has also agreed a committed £960m expansion of its existing debt facilities, supported by lenders including ABN AMRO, BBVA, Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo IMI CIB, Lloyds, the National Wealth Fund, NatWest, SEB and Société Générale. The facility will support their “continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers“.

Finally, an accordion facility of £800m is also being made available to help drive CityFibre’s continued expansion through the acquisition of full fibre network assets. “This facility will be used to finance the company’s M&A pipeline and cement its position as the sector consolidator,” confirmed the announcement. This is a feature of loan agreements that allows them to increase, as required, the total amount of debt available under an existing facility.

Greg Mesch, CEO of CityFibre, said:

“This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre’s next phase of growth, as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network, for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

There is huge opportunity ahead for CityFibre and it is testament to the success of the company that we have such strong backing from our lenders and shareholders. This multi-billion-pound investment into critical digital infrastructure will deliver significant benefits across the UK, helping to realise potential and unlocking economic growth.”

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

“Today’s announcement shows Britain is attracting billions of pounds of investment, including through the National Wealth Fund, driving growth across British businesses.

Investing in our digital infrastructure is key to ensuring our economy is fit for the future. Through our Plan for Change we’re growing the economy by boosting investment in Britain and working hand in hand with businesses to create jobs, to put more money in working people’s pockets.”

The risk in all this is that consolidating alternative networks tends to be a slow, complex and costly process – particularly with many altnets still holding an inflated idea of their own asset values. CityFibre’s strategy around this thus remains somewhat unproven, and any new funding deal they strike now will be subject to less favourable conditions than they had before (e.g. interest payments will be higher).

Put another way, this may not be the last funding deal they’ll need, which means that some of the same underlying funding challenges could still resurface again in the future. The operator also faces other challenges, such as from the recent instability at one of their largest ISP partners, TalkTalk, which currently accounts for c.150k customers via CityFibre and is struggling in ways that could risk wider harm in the future (here).",https://www.ispreview.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nggallery_import/CityFibre-2025-van-on-suburban-road.webp,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:15.687816

Some six lots of Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf have been recalled as they may contain undeclared hazelnuts, which could cause severe reactions to consumers with nut allergies, according to the company’s statement on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s site.

While the packaging of the recalled lots states ""May Contain Tree Nuts,"" it does not state that it ""Contains Hazelnuts."" An investigation revealed an error in the change of packaging for a hazelnut-containing bread to the implicated white bread product.

The dust has settled on the 2025 Summer Black Friday, and the numbers are staggering: In just four days, US online spending hit $24.1 billion. Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3 percent. Reuters reported that 53.2 percent of orders came from mobile devices, with discounts averaging over 20 percent.

What's clear is this: America's consumer market is in the throes of a seismic shift. The e-commerce surge isn't just a symptom - it's the engine driving this transformation.

Beyond a mere pivot from brick-and-mortar to online, this represents a wholesale rewiring of consumer behavior, supply chains, retail models, and global trade dynamics. And at the heart of it? An ever-deepening connection with Chinese manufacturing.

Dig into the data, and ""Made in China"" emerges as the backbone of this boom. On Amazon, 70 percent of goods are Chinese-made. Walmart clocks in at 60 percent, while Target and Best Buy hover around 30 percent and 30-35 percent, respectively. From electronics to apparel to kitchen gadgets, the low-cost, high-quality output of Chinese factories is the linchpin of US retail giants' supply chains.

This isn't just about numbers - it's about an intricate web of interdependence. Despite corporate buzzwords like ""diversification,"" the reality is stark: China's role on critical product categories is unshakable. High-value, high-volume SKUs - think consumer electronics, clothing, and small appliances - are built on China's unmatched cost efficiency and production flexibility. Alternatives like US or Mexican manufacturing can't match the scale, speed, or price.

The consumer side tells the same story. America's trillion-dollar retail market, supercharged by post-pandemic online adoption, leans heavily on China's ability to churn out goods at breakneck speed to meet the demands of high-stakes sales events. Without China's manufacturing capability, retailers would buckle under the pressure of surging orders, competitive pricing, and tight logistics.

The US faces a stark choice: double down on a lose-lose trade war or preserve a mutually beneficial partnership, thereby advancing the transformation of American consumption. The time for decision is now, and the consequences of inaction could be dire.

If Trump-era tariffs make a comeback, the fallout will be brutal. First, inflation - already a sore spot - will spike, hammering a consumer market mid-transformation and dragging down the broader economy. Second, supply chains will fracture. Retailers have dabbled in sourcing from third countries, but the data doesn't lie: New products and restocks still hinge on Chinese factories, ports, and logistics networks. Shifting to other countries or domestic production isn't a quick fix - it's a three-to-five-year slog, at minimum. Third, as observers noted, tariffs will erode industry revenue and choke investment.

July's e-commerce explosion underscores a simple truth: The US and China are locked in a symbiotic dance. The world's biggest consumer market and its largest manufacturer aren't just linked - they're fused in a complex, interdependent relationship. Tariffs won't ""decouple"" this dynamic - they'll just unleash chaos in the short term and significant losses in the long term. The potential economic fallout is not to be underestimated.

History has shown that tariff wars are reckless, unpopular, and unsustainable. China's position is clear and firm: We do not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. Rational negotiation and a commitment to mutual gain are the only path forward. Washington should continue its efforts to translate the high-level agreement into concrete policies that sustain this e-commerce miracle. The importance of these negotiations and the achievement of win-win outcomes through them cannot be overemphasized.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-07-13/c77d6e6c-7c83-4ca4-b1a8-621dae54e1d3.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 07:08:52.813710

As Jury President for the Creative Business Transformation Lions category at this year’s Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Jane Lin-Baden, CEO Asia Pacific of Publicis Groupe, had a front-row seat to some of the world’s most compelling work. Leading a globally diverse jury of strategists, clients, and business and creative leaders, Lin-Baden oversaw entries that went far beyond traditional advertising to demonstrate how creativity is now central to how businesses operate, adapt, and grow.

“The Creative Business Transformation Lions category recognises the powerful impact of creativity on our clients' businesses,” Lin-Baden explained. “We looked for brilliant creative ideas that are core to business operations, where transformation not only delivers proven results but also shows the potential to scale in future.”

Creativity at the Core of Change

Under her leadership, the jury identified three overarching themes that characterised this year’s strongest entries.

The first was the evolution of purpose. While some brands still use purpose as an add-on to raise awareness for a cause, the most impressive work showcased purpose embedded into the operations of a company, driving both commercial and social value in a sustained way.

Second, there was a clear migration from ads to ecosystems. Lin-Baden noted that today’s most transformative creative ideas are no longer confined to marketing. “They impact everything from commercial models to supply chains, legal contracts, suppliers, patents, and stakeholders,” she said. “In other words, the entire ecosystem that supports products and services.”

Third, truly transformative brands are leading category reinvention. The most impactful ideas didn’t just help brands grow; they fundamentally redefined the playing field. By changing the rules, these brands reshaped entire categories and claimed leadership in doing so.

The work that particularly stood out from this year’s awards was the Grand Prix-winning campaign by AXA: ""Three Words"". The campaign added just three words to a home insurance policy, broadening the definition of household protection to include fire, flood, and even domestic violence. “By redefining the category, AXA now owns ‘household insurance’ , creating business and societal value,” said Lin-Baden.

But what truly impressed the jury was the campaign’s scale. The change was retroactively applied to 2.5 million existing contracts, involving legal, commercial, and operational shifts across AXA’s business. “It is a complete system overhaul that sets the benchmark for organisational change,” Lin-Baden said, noting the campaign’s direct contribution to sales growth and brand impact.

Another strong entry, Heineken’s “Backing the Bars”, demonstrated ecosystem-level thinking. The campaign supported bar owners and distributors - the stakeholders most essential to Heineken’s business. “The Jury appreciated the longevity of Heineken's support for its beer ecosystem,” said Lin-Baden. “Building bars is building Heineken.”

Suncorp’s “Building a More Resilient Australia” also left an indelible mark. Rooted in the brand’s purpose of helping customers prevent household damage from extreme weather, the campaign went beyond insurance to deliver real utility and resilience tools. “It brings value back to the business through increased market share, consideration uplifts, and customer lifetime value,” she noted. The jury was particularly impressed by the brand’s five-year commitment to these resilience initiatives.

While all Cannes Lions categories celebrate creativity, the Creative Business Transformation Lions category requires a higher bar: evidence of enduring business impact.

“Our jury asked whether we should reward proven results, or future potential or both,” Lin-Baden said. “The brands that achieve both deserve higher recognition.”

She also noted that not all longstanding brand platforms made the cut. “We saw some textbook examples that had long-term impact but hadn’t evolved with today’s social and political climate,” she explained. One successful example of evolution came from Cheetos, whose long-running “It’s a Cheetos Thing” platform continues to stay fresh and funny, embracing creativity and humour to remain culturally relevant.

Why business transformation is crucial

In Lin-Baden’s view, creative business transformation has never been more essential. “Agencies are playing a pivotal role in helping brands reshape how their business operates, engage customers and deliver business value,” she said. The days of one-off campaigns are fading. “The most impactful agencies are mobilising entire business ecosystems that are affecting everything from supply chains and legal contracts to company culture and stakeholders.”

She believes this shift reflects broader economic and social realities. “This year’s Cannes winners showed the expanding role of creativity in navigating change and solving business problems in a time of uncertainty.”

At Publicis Groupe, this belief in transformation is not theoretical, it is backed by significant investment. “We’ve invested hundreds of millions of euros into a suite of AI applications and agents, built specifically for marketing intelligence and transformation,” Lin-Baden shared.

At the heart of this ecosystem is CoreAI, a proprietary system that unifies Publicis’ consumer and business data. CoreAI allows trillions of data points to be shared across the Groupe and integrated directly into clients’ own business environments. “It brings our creative solutions even closer to their business outcomes,” she said.

Cultivating a culture of change

“Winning requires bravery,” says Lin-Baden. “I believe there is a creative solution for every universal problem we face today.”

For brands and agencies still hesitant to embrace transformation, her message is direct: “Staying still is no longer an option.”

She believes success comes to those willing to experiment on the road to meaningful change. “Clients are seeking insights, intelligence and creativity to make informed decisions in an increasingly shifting landscape. Agencies must innovate and commit to their clients' success.”

Publicis has continuously innovated though its Power of One model - a unified structure that removes silos across disciplines. “Media and creative capabilities are integrated with data and tech, social, CRM, influence, commerce and performance,” she said. This connected culture ensures a seamless, cross-functional approach to solving complex client problems.

She also highlighted the company’s investment in high-growth areas like influencer marketing, commerce, and social media. “These accelerators allow our teams to leverage data to drive transformation,” she explained.

But above all, Lin-Baden points to people as the true engine of transformation. “When we create a connected ecosystem for our people, they’re equipped with the mindset to grow all aspects of our clients' business.”

Looking ahead: creativity in an AI-induced world

As the industry embraces AI and automation, Lin-Baden is clear-eyed about its role: a powerful enabler and not a replacement.

“From the shortlist of Creative Business Transformation Lions contenders, there were only a few works that used AI,” she observed. “But we saw that AI can change how we evolve from ideas to implementation. The right AI prompt is a form of creativity in itself.”

She believes the ability to ask the right questions is becoming one of the most critical skills in marketing. “AI can enhance solutions with deeper analysis, but it cannot replace the creativity and collaboration between clients and agencies.”

As brands navigate a world of increasing complexity, creativity is no longer a ‘nice to have’, instead, it is the engine that powers business reinvention. This year’s Cannes Lions entries show that the most enduring brands are those that turn creativity from a message into a mechanism, one that rewires their systems, empowers their people, and engages their ecosystems. For Lin-Baden, this isn’t just the future of advertising. It’s the future of business.",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2fIMG_Opt1.JPG&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 03:01:37.532979

Most are said to be seeking a controlling stake in the coffee giant’s second-largest market, intensifying scrutiny over the future of Starbucks’ premium playbook in China.

While the Seattle-based chain has denied rumours of a full exit, it has confirmed it’s evaluating strategic options to Campaign Asia-Pacific.

“We see significant long-term potential in China and are evaluating the best ways to capture the future growth opportunities. We are looking for a strategic partner with like-minded values who shares our vision to provide a premium coffeehouse experience,” a spokesperson told Campaign Asia-Pacific. “We remain committed to China and want to retain a meaningful stake in the business. Any deal must make sense for Starbucks' business and partners.”

According to Chinese business outlet The 21st Century Business Herald, Starbucks may retain around 30% of its China unit, with the remainder potentially split among several investors to ensure that no single buyer holds a dominant share. The business is reportedly valued at around US$10 billion, according to a report in CNBC, with nearly 30 private equity firms expressing interest.

Centurium Capital’s name in the mix has raised eyebrows. The private equity firm, which now chairs Luckin Coffee under founder and CEO David Li, is reportedly among those submitting bids for the Starbucks China stake. If successful, it could mark an extraordinary twist in China’s coffee wars, where a backer of Starbucks’ fiercest competitor gains influence over the legacy brand’s local playbook.

Starbucks' struggles to keep pace with fast-growing, budget-friendly local competitors like Luckin are not new. After four consecutive quarters of sales decline in China, the Seattle-based coffee major saw flat growth in its latest quarter, prompting price cuts, menu localisation, and marketing refreshes, including tie-ins with pop culture brands. But the discounting move, a rare deviation from Starbucks’ premium playbook, sparked backlash on Chinese social media, with netizens criticising the cuts as too shallow to make an impact. The lowest-priced item on the menu now sits at RMB 23 yuan (US$3.20), still higher than most rivals.

Starbucks APAC CMO Samuel Fung stepped down earlier this year in February after a 12-year tenure with the coffee giant. Following this, China CMO Erin Silvoy left the region for a position in Seattle in April.

Starbucks entered China in 1999 and has since expanded to 7,685 stores in the market, according to its Q1 FY2025 results. Globally, the chain operates 40,576 outlets.

But its largest local rival, Luckin Coffee, is outpacing the American brand at breakneck speed. As of Q1, Luckin reported 24,032 stores across China and 65 globally, including new outlets in Singapore, Malaysia and most recently the US, where it opened two stores in New York City this July. The company’s high-volume, low-price strategy has proven effective in luring younger, value-conscious Chinese consumers.

While the deal process is still in early stages, shortlisted bidders are expected to gain access to internal financials as Starbucks weighs its next move. For now, the company insists any transaction must align with its long-term vision and values.",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2f20250714043707_Untitled+design+(13).jpg&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 03:02:00.800584

This was as expectations around profitability deteriorated for the first time since last June, according to S&P Global. Firms expect to raise charges only modestly amid rising competition while managing their costs, including via further reductions in headcounts. That said, R&D spending was projected to continue rising to support sales, albeit at a reduced pace.

The net balance of Chinese firms that expect business activity to expand over the next year fell from 17 per cent in February to 11 per cent in June. This marked the lowest degree of confidence since June 2024 and was among the lowest on record. Additionally, optimism in China was below the global average of 24 per cent and the weakest of the BRICS nations, S&P Global said in its latest China Business Outlook survey.

Chinese business confidence weakened in June 2025, with the net balance for future output falling to 11 per cent—its lowest since June 2024. Firms expect modest price hikes amid rising competition and cost control through staff cuts. Profit outlook turned negative, and capex and R&D projections hit record lows. Despite challenges, growth is still expected, supported by government policies.

Business confidence among Chinese companies has weakened in June 2025, with both manufacturing and services sectors reporting a broad-based easing in positive sentiment. The manufacturing sector posted a net balance of 7 per cent, while services stood at 15 per cent, signalling moderation in expectations for future activity.

Key concerns include global trade policy uncertainty and a subdued economic environment, which companies believe will generate weak demand in the year ahead. Firms also cited intense market competition and rising input costs as major headwinds to growth. Despite this, businesses expect government support and improved financial conditions to aid performance, along with enhanced R&D efforts and a potential recovery in domestic demand.

Employment outlook has deteriorated significantly, with the net balance falling from −1 per cent in February to −3 per cent in June—marking the lowest level since February 2020. Both manufacturers (−3 per cent) and service providers (+3 per cent) expect staff reductions, indicating the first broad-based job shedding forecast in over five years.

Capital expenditure and R&D projections have also hit record lows. The net balance for anticipated capex fell to +2 per cent from +7 per cent in February, the lowest since comparable data began in October 2009. R&D intentions dropped to +5 per cent, the weakest since tracking started in February 2019, added the survey.

Cost pressures, however, are forecast to ease. Input and output prices are still expected to rise, but at slower rates. The net balance of firms expecting higher staffing costs stood at +5 per cent—its lowest since records began in 2019—while non-staff cost expectations fell to a nine-year low of +5 per cent. Selling price expectations have softened considerably, with only a net balance of +1 per cent planning price hikes, the lowest since February 2024.

Profit outlook has turned negative. With limited room to raise selling prices, the net balance for profitability dropped to −1 per cent in June from 5 per cent in February, the weakest reading since June 2024 and well below the global average of 8 per cent.

“A further loss of confidence was observed among Chinese firms at the end of the first half of 2025. Optimism regarding future output slipped to the lowest level since last June, with sentiment among manufacturers at a more subdued level compared to their services counterparts,” said Jingyi Pan, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“Despite expectations for slower cost increases, including via the management of salary outlays by reducing headcounts, Chinese businesses turned pessimistic regarding profitability in the year ahead. This reflected the challenges that companies anticipate regarding global trade and the ensuing impact on demand,” added Pan. “Overall, growth is still expected in the year ahead among Chinese firms as supportive policies and investment into new product launches are forecasted to drive sales. Even as firms planned to lower staffing levels, capital expenditure and R&D spending are reportedly set to continue growing, the latter at a rate that that remains above the global average.”

Speaking with Jon Watts, managing director of the Coalition for Innovation in Media Measurement, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Ng described how identity, data, and AI are reshaping modern marketing.

“Something that Epsilon has done pretty well over the past five-plus years is really our truth set, our identity set from a U.S. perspective,” Ng said. “The reason why Lotame was so critical for us was it was our ability to bring our version of identity to the rest of the world.”

Epsilon recently acquired Lotame, a global data solutions provider, to accelerate its ability to unify identity data across markets like EMEA, APAC and Latin America.

“It’s not just a one-size-fits-all,” Ng said. “We make sure that we kind of evaluate the data set. That was part of the due diligence, part of the M&A process evaluating how identity is done by various companies, not just Lotame.”

Power of connected identity

For Epsilon, identity is the common thread that connects paid, owned, and earned marketing, and it is central to Publicis Groupe’s broader growth strategy.

“Connected identity is kind of the two-word phrase that we use both internally at Publicis and Epsilon, but also externally with our clients,” Ng said. “It’s really the thread that you pull between all forms of marketing.”

Ng explained that understanding consumers at the individual level enables brands to engage more effectively, whether through search, programmatic display, loyalty programs, or email campaigns.

“It’s really how do you know that individual horizontally as well,” he said.

Measurement, Ng emphasized, is what sets Epsilon apart.

“For us, having that measurability at that individual level, we do think differentiates us,” he said. “We do talk about the front and the back end as well.”

One view, one vision, one voice

Epsilon’s approach centers on providing marketers with a holistic understanding of their customers and orchestrating relevant messaging across channels.

“If you’re a financial services client, you might know a very, very deep depth of what your customers spend within that sector,” Ng explained. “But you may not know all the time demographic, zip code. You also may not know what CPG items you’re buying at the supermarket.”

That broader perspective, Ng said, is critical for delivering personalized marketing based on real consumer behavior and life stage. As an example, he shared his own experience shopping for a new television.

“The minute I buy the TV, I’m not looking to buy another TV right away. My wife would kill me,” Ng said. “But I might look at loyalty, I might look at a speaker system, I might look at a warranty.”

For Ng, true marketing harmony comes when brands stitch together the customer view, their purchase journey and real-time media activation.

“Stitching that all together is really where the magic happens,” he said. “It’s the identity and knowing when and where and how to address the consumer at the right place.”

Predictive AI, not just generative AI

While much of the marketing world focuses on flashy generative AI tools, Epsilon’s strength lies in predictive AI capabilities.

“We’re not really in the generative AI space, but we are in the predictive AI space,” Ng said. “It’s really around how do you find and predict the right individual, again around identity, and the right message, and the right context of when to find that person.”

Within Publicis Groupe, generative AI may play a role in creative development, but Ng emphasized that Epsilon complements that by applying predictive AI to improve targeting and message delivery.

“We marry that up on the predictive piece to then serve that and deliver that,” he said.

AI as democratizing force

Ng argued that AI has the potential to empower small and medium-sized businesses, not just large enterprises.

“I’m a big fan of how it democratizes it,” he said, pointing to AI’s role in making identity solutions more accessible. “It’s still first-party data that they own and they operate. How do you then utilize AI? It’s really the ideas that make the most difference.”

He predicted a shift in industry dynamics where creativity becomes an even greater differentiator.

“In the next 10 years, 20 years with AI, the ideas people might actually rise because AI is helping us build things faster,” Ng said. “We may, for the first time in the industry, have a shortage of ideas, not engineers.”

Retail media and the future of the market

Looking ahead to 2030, Ng expects retail media and commerce media to continue their rapid ascent, helping marketers diversify beyond dominant walled gardens.

“It’s almost what’s old is new, just like 90s fashion,” Ng said. “Audience, media identity, data monetization, these are things that happened in the 2000s, 2010s, 2020s went out of vogue, they’re now back in vogue with a different moniker.”

Retail media, Ng believes, represents an opportunity to democratize access to high-quality data and advertising solutions.

“I do hope that retail media kind of democratizes even the ability for more people to kind of fragment or shift budgets away, where it’s not so concentrated to some of the few walled gardens,” he said.

Ng closed the discussion with practical advice for marketers navigating complex technology ecosystems.

“There’s so much Frankensteining, there’s so much identity definition that’s different,” he said, warning against fragmented tech stacks that hinder interoperability. “The future next five years is interoperability of any partner that marketer would look at, because that’s how you actually measure the efficacy better.”

Otherwise, Ng cautioned, marketers risk getting lost in a sea of disconnected data points.

“There’s no unification there,” he said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/98069-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:00:58.031195

The bills would require third-party companies like Instacart and Shipt pay food delivery workers a minimum wage of $21.44 an hour or higher. That's the same rate restaurant delivery workers for apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash are currently paid.

The legislative package also includes making sure delivery workers get paid within seven days of the pay period ending, making sure customers have an opportunity to tip at least 10% before placing the order, and requiring companies pay workers when they log on, even if they aren't making deliveries.

Reactions mixed to grocery delivery worker bills

An Instacart delivery worker named Tommy M. said the bills are a start.

""It's still not enough, but I mean, it gives us hope,"" he said. ""It will be a pay increase, but it's not outrageous.""

Some shoppers outside a Key Food in Park Slope are in support of the bills.

""I think one of the things that's holding everything down is inequality, and so I would be all for it. I would be all for raising the minimum wage,"" shopper David Reed said.

Others worry increasing the minimum wage will increase grocery prices.

""I know it's going to. It's doing it already. Oh, definitely,"" shopper Susan Levy said.

Food delivery companies slam bills

Instacart and Shipt are both opposed to the bill.

An Instacart spokesperson said in a statement:

""It's simply unconscionable that the City Council is considering a bill that would jeopardize a lifeline thousands of New Yorkers rely on — particularly those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges. The city's own data shows that this bill could drive grocery delivery costs up by a staggering 46%, cut off access to work for thousands of NYC delivery workers, and increase fees on local grocers.""

A spokesperson for Shipt said in a statement:

""We urge the Council to reconsider these bills before moving forward. These bills were developed without input from grocery delivery workers about their desire for flexibility and without acknowledgment of their distinct experiences working with platforms like Shipt. Passing these bills as drafted could lead to unintended consequences that hurt both the very workers they aim to protect and families that depend on grocery delivery.""

A spokesperson for Uber said the company would not be commenting on what he called the ""forced tipping bill.""

Dr James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Centre for New York City Affairs at the New School, who consulted with the city on the delivery workers’ pay, said there needed to be more improvement in minimum pay standards.
Council member Sandy Nurse, a Democrat who sponsored the grocery delivery workers Bill, said she had watched delivery companies evolve over the years at the expense of the workers.

A ground-breaking package of Bills passed in 2021 had set a minimum pay and addressed difficult working conditions for app-based food delivery workers, but only for those who delivered food from restaurants through apps such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. The minimum rate was fully implemented from April 1, 2025.

The new legislation will require third-party app companies such as Instacart and Shipt to pay grocery delivery workers a minimum of US$21.44 (S$27.46) an hour to match the increase the food delivery workers received in April.

The Bills, five in total, will also mandate that the companies provide an option in their apps to give at least a 10 per cent tip, before or at the same time an order is placed, and that the companies must pay workers within seven days of the end of a pay period.

The delivery industry, which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, has continued to grow in New York City, with more than 100 million deliveries arranged through third-party apps. According to the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, there are an estimated 60,000 restaurant delivery workers in the city.

“It’s a huge milestone to make app delivery work more dignified, better paid and safer in our streets,” said Ms Ligia Guallpa, a co-founder of the Worker’s Justice Project, a worker centre that organises low-wage, immigrant workers.

Her group organises Los Deliveristas Unidos, an advocacy group for delivery workers.

Dr James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Centre for New York City Affairs at the New School, who consulted with the city on the delivery workers’ pay, said there needed to be more improvement in minimum pay standards.

But, he added, “we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that these pay standards for delivery workers in New York City are the best pay standards that exist in the United States”.

Mr Juan Felipe, 30, a grocery delivery worker, said he had cut back working for Instacart because he was making only about US$2 to US$7 an hour, and he did not plan on rushing back any time soon even if the legislation was passed.

“If we get that rate, that would be amazing,” he said. “But we’ll have to see what it’s going to be like.”

Mr Felipe said he often parks outside big-box retail store Costco in Queens, one of dozens of gig workers waiting for possible jobs to appear in their apps.

Council member Sandy Nurse, a Democrat who sponsored the grocery delivery workers Bill, said she had watched delivery companies evolve over the years at the expense of the workers.

“The apps are creating an environment that is unregulated, that doesn’t have a lot of worker protections,” Ms Nurse said. “Because a lot of these workers are immigrant workers, there’s just a lot of opportunity for exploitation.”

On July 12, Grubhub said in a statement that it was working with advocacy groups and the City Council “to make sure New York’s delivery workforce is protected without sacrificing the flexibility customers expect”.

Instacart said in a statement: “At a time when millions across the city are already struggling with rising costs for food and daily essentials, we urge the City Council to consider the real-world consequences this Bill could have on the families and communities that depend on grocery delivery the most.”

Uber and DoorDash did not reply to a request for comment.

In 2023, Grubhub, along with DoorDash and Uber Eats, filed requests for a temporary restraining order just days before an initial increase of the minimum wage for food delivery workers, to US$17.96 per hour, was to take effect. The requests contended that regulators used inaccurate data to calculate compensation.

A judge ruled against the three food delivery companies, allowing the city to raise the workers’ minimum wage to nearly US$18, and increase it further to US$20 or more in 2025.

The three companies had also filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that the city’s 15 per cent cap on fees charged to restaurants for online orders and 5 per cent cap for other fees was unconstitutional and prevented them from negotiating their own prices with restaurants.

The suit was settled in 2025 after the City Council made adjustments to the law that created some exceptions to the cap.

Although legislation would signify a victory for delivery workers, Council member Shaun Abreu, a Democrat and a sponsor of three Bills in the new package, said he had noticed forms of “retaliation” from third-party apps, like randomly deactivating workers’ accounts and removing the tipping option at checkout.

Mr Abreu said he planned to introduce legislation to prohibit the abrupt deactivation of delivery workers’ accounts by major third-party apps.

Mr William Medina, 37, who delivers for Uber Eats and is a member of Los Deliveristas Unidos, said he was very concerned about the “thousands” of delivery workers whose accounts had recently been deactivated.

“This is a very critical issue,” Mr Medina said. “We just need somebody, a real person who can mediate between the company and the worker on the deactivation process.” NYTIMES",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/554c2a35204da37279e95df54491658a20f554b21226cfe769924874d5514430,N,,2025-07-14 00:58:38.749266

Louisville saw its first Publix store open in 2024, and already, that store is drawing shoppers from 15 of Kroger’s 25 Louisville locations, based on the firm’s shopper data.","Meanwhile, other grocers have announced growth plans on a national scale. Aldi plans to open 225 stores this year, a record for the chain, as part of a five-year strategy. Sprouts has plans for at least 35 new stores this year. Walmart opened its first new Neighborhood Market grocery store in three years in 2024 and its first Supercenter in four years in 2025.

All of this is putting further pressure on Kroger, the largest traditional supermarket operator in the U.S. by revenue — not including Walmart or Costco — according to Deloitte. The company currently lacks the direction of permanent leadership after its longtime CEO Rodney McMullen resigned in March after an investigation of personal conduct. The company is also working to cut costs, closing 60 underperforming stores, after spending more than $1 billion on its failed pursuit of competitor Albertsons. A Kroger spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Additionally, these retailers also beat Kroger in revenue growth, according to the NRF and Kantar’s annual list of the top 100 U.S. retailers by sales. Aldi grew 14% from 2023 to 2024, Sprouts grew 13%, H-E-B grew 7%, and Publix grew 5%, while Kroger grew 2%, per the report.

Erich Kahner, director of strategy and insights in the Americas for Dunnhumby, told Modern Retail that, because of improvements in the consumer and economic environment since the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, grocers now may be more willing to make longer-term bets on expanding their private labels, growing their store count or making acquisitions.

“Compared to the last five years, the past 12 months have been relatively unique in the sense that customers haven’t faced a ton of disruption in their monthly budgets, unemployment has been pretty steady, interest rates have been creeping back down and inflation has been relatively normal,” Kahner said.

‘A key battleground’ for Kroger

A Dunnhumby study measuring both customer perception and financial data found H-E-B to be the No. 1 grocery store in the U.S. in 2024, the fourth time within eight years. Kroger ranked No. 17.

“Given the strength of H-E-B in Texas, I think that’s a key battleground for Kroger that represents the challenge they face in a lot of their frontier markets,” being markets outside of its home region of the Midwest, Kahner said.

He added that the further away grocers get from their home markets, the share of customer grocery budgets they are able to capture erodes. The average Kroger customer in Cincinnati gives about 50% of their grocery budget to Kroger, according to Kahner, based on his firm’s data (which is based on the consumer perception study as well as Placer.ai foot traffic data from cell phones), and in Dallas, it’s 30% of their grocery budget. In Louisville, Publix gets about 20% of the average shopper’s grocery budget, but 40% in Orlando.

Kroger has been in Texas since the ’50s, but Kahner believes its market share is at risk, given H-E-B’s strong perception throughout Texas.

“Each Kroger location only has one or two H-E-Bs [in the Dallas area] to go up against, but we would expect H-E-B to continue to densify in Dallas until that number is more like four or five locations that each Kroger is going up against,” he said.

Kroger versus Publix

On the Publix front, Kahner pointed to Louisville as a model of what could happen in Cincinnati. Louisville saw its first Publix store open in 2024, and already, that store is drawing shoppers from 15 of Kroger’s 25 Louisville locations, based on the firm’s shopper data. “That Publix is definitely a threat to Kroger – just that single Publix alone.”

Dunnhumby found Kroger’s strength lies in its loyalty and personalization capabilities digitally, while H-E-B has the upper hand on private brand quality and its local community connection and, Publix wins on assortment and store experience. Kroger has still improved over the past four or five years, Kahner said.

“Kroger has actually been on an upward journey in the strength of its overall brand equity with customers,” Kahner said. “They haven’t always been in our top quartile; they’ve snuck in the top quartile the last couple of years.”

Ross Cloyd, grocery analyst for Kantar, said he has personally seen changes in Kroger’s merchandising, assortment and store experience from market to market, based on which competitors are nearby. He said he noticed in Georgia that Kroger would have signs in its stores detailing at which local farms and farmers the produce came from, similar to messaging created by Publix. Additionally, in Texas he noticed “Texas proud” signage and dedicated local sections that would remind him of H-E-B — neither of which he would see in his home state of Indiana.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/20231024_HEBManvelVIPOpen033.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 06:06:09.807671

A Capgemini Research Institute report, Future encrypted: Why post-quantum cryptography tops the new cybersecurity agenda, highlights that rapid progress of quantum computing threatens to render current encryption algorithms obsolete. ‘Harvest-now, decrypt-later’³ attacks, together with tightening regulations and the evolving technology landscape, have elevated the importance of quantum safety.

However, despite increasing awareness within the industry, many organizations still underestimate the risks surrounding quantum computing, which could lead to future data breaches and regulatory penalties.

According to the report, around two-thirds (65%) of organizations are concerned about the rise of ‘harvest-now, decrypt-later’ attacks. One in six early adopters believe that ‘Q-day’ will be within five years, while around six in ten believe it will arrive within a decade.

Marco Pereira, Global Head of Cybersecurity, Cloud Infrastructure Services at Capgemini, said, “Quantum readiness isn’t about predicting a date–it’s about managing irreversible risk. Every encrypted asset today could become tomorrow’s breach if organizations delay adopting post-quantum protections. Transitioning early ensures business continuity, regulatory alignment, and long-term trust.

“Quantum safety is not a discretionary spend but a strategic investment, which can turn a looming risk into a competitive advantage. The organizations that recognize this fact early will best insulate themselves against future cyber-attacks,” Pereira said.

While current quantum computers cannot break widely used encryption yet, high-risk industries such as defense and banking are leading the adoption of quantum-safe solutions. In contrast, consumer-focused sectors like consumer products and retail sectors are showing less urgency.

Post-quantum cryptography migration preferred over other quantum-security solutions

Most organizations surveyed (70%) are protecting their systems against emerging quantum threats by adopting the appropriate mix of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms.

They view PQC as the best option to address near-term quantum security risks because it provides a comprehensive approach to securing data. Nearly half of early adopters are already exploring, assessing feasibility, or piloting PQC solutions. For 70% of organizations, regulatory mandates are a key driver behind the shift to PQC.

While the early adopters are working towards quantum safety, a few organizations (30%) are still ignoring the quantum threat. They are struggling to allocate sufficient budget and personnel to cryptographic transition.

Report Methodology: The Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 1,000 organizations with annual revenue of at least $1 billion across 13 sectors and 13 countries in Asia–Pacific, Europe, and North America. The global survey was carried out in April–May 2025. Around 70% of the sample in this report are referred to as ‘early adopters’. This segment is either working on or planning to work on quantum-safe solutions in the next five years. The survey findings were supplemented through in-depth interviews with sixteen industry executives.

The ""Mexican"" chain first embraced crispy chicken in April, adding nuggets to its menu after a hugely successful limited run a few months prior, per Fox Business. ""The demand for our nuggets was off the charts,"" the company's Chief Marketing Officer Taylor Montgomery said, ""which is why we’re looking at making crispy chicken permanent...""

In June, they added the Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos. Although these items will only be available for a limited time, the company promises crispy chicken will become a mainstay on the menu come 2026. ""The craving for crispy chicken is growing every single day and our fans told us loud and clear: give us more,"" food innovation exec Liz Matthews said in a Taco Bell press release. Montgomery added, ""Crispy chicken is having a moment.""",https://parade.com/.image/t_share/ODowMDAwMDAwMDAwODc3Mjg3/sign-for-fast-food-brand-taco-bell.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 02:03:26.239452

FashionNetwork.com: How strong is LVMH in Italy?

Toni Belloni: The group has six Italian houses ( , , Pucci, Loro Piana, and Cova cafés, editor's note). It has 280 boutiques and 66 production workshops, employing more than 18,000 people in the country, while employing nearly 100,000 others through its network of more than 4,000 suppliers and subcontractors. The Italian ecosystem offers a particularly favorable context for the development of luxury brands.

FNW: LVMH invested heavily in Italy last year. Will it continue to do so?

TB: In 2024, we invested around 500 million euros in Italy, as a large number of projects came to fruition over the same period. Previously, we were investing more like 100 million euros, so I don't think we'll be deploying that kind of money again. But it does testify to the fact that the Group is continuing to commit to new, and even major, investments.

FNW: What are LVMH's current projects in Italy?

TB: For 2026, a new workshop dedicated to accessories will be built ex novo in Pontassieve, Tuscany. There's also Loro Piana's major project at Ghemme, in the cashmere district near Novara in Piedmont, which will set up an industrial complex around a historic building, bringing together under one roof its various workshops currently scattered around the valley, as well as other activities. We are also renovating a number of Belmond Group hotels, including the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. In Milan, the three flagships of Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Tiffany & Co. were opened on Via Montenapoleone, followed by the three new openings on the same street of Fendi, and .

FNW: In view of the economic situation, have you reviewed certain investments?

TB: Investment projects are medium-term, and cannot be stopped or restarted from one day to the next. At the very least, we can delay the opening of a store for a few months, or postpone certain investments for the long term, but I think that the strategic commitment is to invest. First of all, on the store front. This year, we plan to open at least five of the six major stores I mentioned in Milan. But also in the supply chain, which I think still needs to be strengthened culturally in terms of training, but also from an infrastructure point of view.

FNW: Have any of the planned investments been postponed?

TB: Our strategic horizon, whether in the retail or industrial sectors, is three to five years. So we have to realize that we're betting on a market that will continue to grow in the medium to long term, while we're more cautious about the next six or even nine months. Clearly, we're not in a glorious market phase. But, as a reminder, the current situation follows a period of almost thirty months, from 2021 to mid-2023, of euphoric growth, which frankly was not sustainable.

""Consistent with the above comments of the Review Panel, now that the FWC has issued its decision in the SDA v McDonald's case, the scope of the supported bargaining laws needs to be reconsidered.
""We always warned from the time leading up to the September 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit that the implementation of radical changes to bargaining laws would be a 'slow burn'.
""The bargaining claim comes on the back of a separate SDA proposal to curtail the capacity of retail and fast food businesses to engage junior employees on discounted rates.
""Employers in the fast food industry, such as McDonald's, are proud to offer thousands of young workers their first employment opportunity but they aren't a magic pudding that can accommodate dramatic cost increases.","""The Fair Work Commission's recent controversial decision to issue a supported bargaining authorisation requiring McDonald's franchisees in South Australia to enter into multi-party bargaining arrangements has undoubtedly emboldened the SDA to bargain for a multi-employer agreement across all McDonald's restaurants,"" said Innes Willox, Chief Executive of the national employer association Australian Industry Group.

""The SDA application represents a dramatic and sadly inevitable escalation of the Government's multi-bargaining laws across the economy, well beyond what the Government suggested would occur when it pushed through the laws in late 2022. Employer warnings at the time of economy-wide implications of the laws on jobs, costs, business confidence and investment are now unfortunately coming to pass.

""An application seeking to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers. Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission.

""As we have previously warned, there is now a clear risk that thousands of employers in the fast food, retail, hospitality and many other sectors, will be dragged into multi-employer bargaining by unions against their will and without the support of the majority of their employees. This includes many small businesses that are struggling to survive in the current difficult trading environment.

""The union-friendly supported bargaining stream was intended to operate in sectors where the employers and employees need a lot of support to bargain, typically because of the Government-funded nature of those sectors.

""There is a real risk that this stream now operates as an unfair mechanism for unions to seek to evade safeguards in the existing bargaining stream that generally require unions to demonstrate that a workforce wants them to bargain with their employers before a business can be forced into bargaining with them.

""Many hundreds of enterprise agreements have been made in the fast food industry and there is no reason why the main enterprise bargaining laws should not apply, including the requirement for a union to establish that the majority of employees support the negotiation of an enterprise agreement.

""In the context of McDonald's there are also real questions about whether the SDA actually represents many employees working in the chain of restaurants, let alone whether the majority of workers who will be impacted by the union bargaining claims support their application.

""Australian Industry Group urges the Federal Government to introduce urgent amendments to the Fair Work Act to tighten up the scope of the supported bargaining stream, and to address the unintended consequences reflected in the FWC's decision.

""The recent Draft Report of the Review Panel that considered whether the bargaining laws were operating as intended, contains the following relevant comments:

'The Review Panel acknowledges that the ongoing matter in relation to McDonald's franchises in South Australia may, in future, require further consideration about the intended scope of the supported bargaining stream. However, until such time as the FWC has considered the evidence in that matter, it is premature to consider further changes.'

""Consistent with the above comments of the Review Panel, now that the FWC has issued its decision in the SDA v McDonald's case, the scope of the supported bargaining laws needs to be reconsidered.

""We always warned from the time leading up to the September 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit that the implementation of radical changes to bargaining laws would be a 'slow burn'. The implications and risk of the amendments are now clearly being demonstrated.

""The bargaining claim comes on the back of a separate SDA proposal to curtail the capacity of retail and fast food businesses to engage junior employees on discounted rates.

""Ultimately, there is a very real risk that unsustainable unions claims, pushed by the SDA through either bargaining or their award case, will undermine the viability of employers in the fast food industry continuing their model of offering employment opportunities to young workers.

""Employers in the fast food industry, such as McDonald's, are proud to offer thousands of young workers their first employment opportunity but they aren't a magic pudding that can accommodate dramatic cost increases. They operate in a highly competitive and cost-sensitive environment.

""Expert evidence advanced in the Award case by Australian Industry Group shows that the SDA's wage claim in the proceedings will cause thousands of young workers to lose their jobs. Efforts to achieve the same increases through bargaining would have similar impacts.

""The SDA seems determined to attack employment opportunities for young people in the fast food and retail sectors, despite there being few other sectors that offer a pathway into employment for these workers. It is a sad day when it is obvious that union claims will potentially deny employment opportunities to thousands of young Australians wanting to get their foot on the job ladder,"" Mr Willox said.",https://www.aigroup.com.au/globalassets/images/aigroup-og-standard.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 02:03:31.760078

Hybrid work could potentially improve productivity, reduce employee turnover, and lower business costs like real estate for as much as 55% according to a survey by the International Workplace Group (IWG) and global engineering consultancy Arup.

Citing a US-modelled survey, the study revealed that hybrid working could generate $282b in Gross Value Added (GVA) annually by 2030 and $729b by 2045, through increased productivity, reduced turnover, lower replacement costs, and portfolio savings.

Productivity could also improve by 11% driven by lower commutes, with employees benefiting from increased focus time and fewer distractions, ultimately spending up to 40% of time saved from travelling on additional work. In fact, the rate of employees reporting their productivity levels as ‘excellent’ in flexible workspaces is 67% higher than those working from home.

The report estimates that this could unlock $54.4b in annual GVA within five years, rising to $140.3b by 2045.

In a previous IWG study, 77% of Gen Z workers in Singapore reported higher job satisfaction under a hybrid model, with 34% saying their work-life balance improved.

IWG estimates that employees working closer to home can save up to $39,400 annually by avoiding daily commutes.

Why Cindy Rose?
All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.
In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft.
This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.","On Thursday this week, British advertising giant WPP announced that it will appoint board member Cindy Rose as the new Chief Executive Officer. According to the relevant announcement, the new CEO will officially take office on September 1st, which means that Mark Read, the current CEO of WPP, will leave his position four months earlier than originally planned.

Notably, one day before the announcement, WPP released an unscheduled financial report update, significantly lowering its full - year performance forecast, which caused the stock price to plummet by 18.09% in a single day, the largest single - day decline since 2020. This is likely to make people have some associations - Mark Read is most likely to be held accountable for WPP's declining performance.

After all, 2025 can almost be said to be a year when WPP's performance suffered an unprecedented setback. First, in March this year, WPP lost Coca - Cola's North American media business. Subsequently, Paramount also announced the end of its 20 - year partnership with WPP. In June this year, Mars, the fast - moving consumer goods giant, also chose to transfer its $1.7 billion advertising business covering more than 70 different markets around the world to Publicis Groupe.

This means that in just one year, WPP has lost several long - term giant clients. This is obviously not a good sign. After all, most brands do not change their agents frequently, which means that WPP may not be able to regain these lost orders for at least the next 3 - 5 years.

In addition to the lost clients, the competitive pressure WPP faces is also increasing. Even if we don't mention the digital advertising sector that has been continuously squeezed by various Internet companies, in the traditional agency field, with the completion of the merger of Omnicom and IPG, WPP will obviously face more challenges in the second half of the year.

At this time, the only good news may be that with WPP's announcement of a leadership change, WPP's stock price immediately rebounded in the short term, rising 3.58% to $30.39 in pre - market trading. This relatively positive signal seems to indicate that the market views this appointment as a relatively positive sign. Of course, from a pessimistic perspective, it may also be that the market believes that WPP's current dilemma has reached its limit, and as long as there is a change, it may be a good thing.

So, who exactly is WPP's new CEO? Why does WPP's board of directors believe that Cindy Rose will be the key leader to pull WPP out of the mire?

Why Cindy Rose?

All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.

In fact, looking at Cindy Rose's entire work experience, we will find that her career path is very different from that of the current CEOs of other 4A groups. Whether it is Arthur Sadoun, the CEO of Publicis Groupe, or John Wren, the CEO of Omnicom Group, they almost all worked in advertising companies before joining their respective groups. Hiroshi Igarashi, the current CEO of Dentsu, has been working at Dentsu since graduation and took over as CEO in 2017.

In contrast, Cindy Rose's work experience is almost entirely cross - industry. After joining Disney in 1995, she spent 15 years working her way up to the senior vice - president of the Interactive Media Group in the EMEA region (a combination of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). In 2010, she joined Virgin Media in the UK and promoted the innovative model of bundling broadband and TV services. Then in 2014, she joined Vodafone, an old rival of Virgin and one of the world's largest mobile communication companies, to be responsible for the transformation of its mobile communication business. In 2016, she joined Microsoft as the president of Western Europe and the CEO of the UK, and in 2023, she became the chief operating officer of its global enterprise business, leading the digital transformation strategy in the European market.

If we analyze further, we will find that whether it is Disney, Vodafone, or Microsoft, these companies seem to be ""digital industrial companies"" in their respective fields. Disney can be said to be the first traditional film and television company to accept and try the streaming media business. Vodafone has the world's most complete enterprise information management system and customer service system. In fact, many people believe that this is the key for Vodafone to maintain its strong competitiveness.

Microsoft is even more of Cindy Rose's career peak. If we organize the relevant information, we will find that from 2020 to 2023, in just three years, Cindy Rose promoted the implementation of the ""cloud - first"" strategy in 17 Western European countries at the strategic level, increasing the market share of Azure cloud services in this region by 8 percentage points in three years. She also established Microsoft's first industrial AI R & D center in Munich.

In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft. On the one hand, she designed a new operating model called ""Customer Success Units"", restructured the global enterprise customer service team into 12 industry vertical units, and promoted the in - depth integration of the sales and technology teams, shortening the solution delivery cycle by 30%. She also participated in optimizing the product roadmap of Azure Stack HCI and designing the architecture of the multi - cloud management solution.

As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said when evaluating her - ""Cindy Rose successfully brought Microsoft's global enterprise business into a new AI - driven stage.""

This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds. So, is this new CEO really suitable for WPP at present? Or why has she become the ""savior"" in the eyes of WPP's board of directors, and why are they so eager to have her become the new captain of WPP, this advertising giant?

Is WPP in a Mess?

Obviously, WPP's current dilemma is exactly the type that Cindy Rose is good at. But to explain this in detail, we need to go back to an earlier time.

In 2018, Martin Sorrell, the founder of WPP, left the advertising empire he built. Mark Read became the second captain of WPP. However, the advertising group he faced at that time was not an aggressive and united one. On the contrary, due to Sorrell's radical merger and expansion strategy in his era, WPP at that time was a huge organization formed through capital integration and mergers, with more than 400 agencies covering multiple marketing fields such as advertising creativity, media placement, public relations, and market research, in different regions and sub - fields.

This made the recognition of the group brand even lower than that of its well - known agencies in many cases. A current executive of WPP once told the American financial media ""Business Insider"": ""WPP has long been regarded as an investment tool aimed at acquiring agencies and rewarding shareholders. To put it bluntly, it has a rather 'dispersed and chaotic' atmosphere.""

Of course, in Sorrell's era, this chaos did not really affect the company's performance. After all, at that time, the clients were also in a state of disunity. Different clients in different industries and fields had almost completely different ideas, which meant that for WPP at that time, even if it could integrate different agencies into a perfect whole, it was still difficult to form effective synergy.

However, with the increasing popularity of digital marketing, especially the rapid maturity of discriminative AI, data - driven digital marketing has gradually become the most important channel in the marketing industry. At this stage, as Internet companies began to build their own walled gardens through data, WPP's traditional decentralized model made it difficult for the group to fully integrate the data and technical capabilities of different agencies. Not to mention the low efficiency in communication and collaboration caused by this traditional decentralized structure.

As the global CMO of Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser, once complained at the American Advertisers Conference:

""Too much management, high rent, and indirect costs of many advertising groups make advertisers feel overwhelmed. The business of agencies has become more complex, with layers of account managers to convey information, resulting in advertising companies no longer focusing on creativity, and spending too much time on phone conferences, off - site activities, business trips, and PPT presentations.""

And this was exactly when Mark Read officially took the helm of WPP in 2018. Perhaps Sorrell realized that he could no longer drive WPP, the world's largest advertising group at that time, into deeper waters with old methods in the new era, so Read became the new captain.

From today's perspective, the strategic approach Read formulated at that time did conform to the direction of market evolution. On the one hand, he promoted in - depth integration within the company, proposing ""One Company, Not a Group"", and merged many well - known agencies except Ogilvy to some extent. He even sold the equity of some agencies and non - core businesses.

In 2025, he restructured the media agency brand GroupM into a unified entity called ""WPP Media"", laid off up to 40% - 45% of the staff, and brought media subsidiaries such as Mindshare and Wavemaker under unified management. At the same time, he began to acquire a large number of technology companies and made heavy investments in the AI field, investing nearly £300 million per day. He built a self - developed intelligent marketing operating system called WPP Open, which integrates the full - link capabilities of creative production, media placement, and data analysis and embeds generative AI tools.

As for the final effect, opinions vary. Many current and former employees of WPP have complained about Read's decision to discontinue many well - known creative brands. For example, in November 2018, Wunderman and JWT (J. Walter Thompson) merged, and the JWT brand became history.

A former employee of Ogilvy told Morketing: ""This move is as ridiculous as deleting Lincoln from American history.""

However, there are also positive aspects. As the most heavily invested intelligent marketing operating system in WPP's history, by March 2025, WPP Open could cover 48,000 employees (60% of the customer service team), generate 130,000 personalized advertisements for Cadbury's Indian market, reach 94 million people, and reduce costs by 90%.

However, Read still failed to solve the old problems of organizational bloating and cumbersome processes caused by WPP's years of mergers. But the era has once again reached a new crossroads. The era of artificial intelligence is just around the corner, and the confrontation between technology giants and advertising groups has reached a critical moment. As a person with rich experience in technology giants and corporate transformation, Cindy Rose, just like Mark Read when he took over the helm from Martin Sorrell in 2018, has become the new helmsman of this huge ship.

And the problems WPP is facing now are exactly what she is good at, just like the work she did during her tenure as the chief operating officer at Microsoft - through organizational structure reform, deeply integrating the sales, technology (and now creativity) teams, and shortening the entire advertising production and delivery cycle. At the same time, truly commercializing AI and integrating it into the group's processes.

Her experience is a key asset that WPP Group urgently needs to cope with industry changes.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250712/v2_50cee8dd35674dea8d0f4e7585adb984@000000@ai_oswg387546oswg1536oswg722_img_000~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 00:00:53.082222

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.","New York: Kraft Heinz Co is looking to spin off a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products, into a new entity that could be valued at as much as US$20bil on its own, the Wall Street Journal reports.

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

News of the potential move was the second effort last week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier last week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a US$3.1bil buyout deal from Italy’s Ferrero.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said.

The company’s shares closed up 2.5%. It currently has a market value of US$31.33bil.

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for the company’s lunch combos and other products.

It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the United States after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

According to the Wall Street Journal report last Friday, a split could be finalised in the coming weeks, but Kraft Heinz has discussed other scenarios with its advisers and its board has not signed off on a final decision.

The company is also working on which brands would be part of the spun-off entity, the report said.

“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.

“As consumer packaged goods makers (CPGs) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to mergers and acquisitions and or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory,” Rattigan said. — Reuters",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/07/14/3415065.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:26.271879

Despite PC market growth in other geographies, the US market is starting to feel the pinch of import tariffs.

“We expected the US market to cool down this quarter given the inventory buildup to begin the year, but what we’re witnessing here might highlight US PC demand slowing down in anticipation of the import tariffs looming deadline,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “Despite a flat US PC market, the rest of the world demonstrated an appetite for PCs, fueled by an aging installed base and by a steady transition to Windows 11.”

“We realize growth in such an indeterminate market seems odd, but many factors come into play supporting the momentum,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers. “The supply side of the industry is doing its best to navigate the unknowns as no one wants to sit on their heels and potentially miss an opportunity, but at the same time it is very risky carrying inventory which is a possibility given the strong first half sell-in. The bigger concern is what overall demand looks like as we get late into Q3 and beyond. Price increases will likely be dispersed over time and geography depending on vendor strategy which can potentially lead to some attractive promotions as a way to clear inventory backups, which seems odd at a time when prices are expected to rise because of tariffs.”

Quartr reports that, in 2023, the stored value of Starbucks cards sat at a whopping $1.6 billion.
So, it's safe to say that, much like the popular practice of customizing your drink order, Starbucks is a big fan of gift card purchases, because all that unspent Starbucks card money is like a loan that the company doesn't have to pay interest on.
Much of the Starbucks stored card value is actually the balance that customers keep on the mobile card on the app.
The Starbucks mobile app has been around for over 15 years now, and it's seen some massive changes.","For a seasoned coffee drinker, a Starbucks gift card is not only thoughtful, it's practical, too. Getting one of those coveted cards from a friend, a job, or even buying one for yourself can come in handy during a caffeine crisis. But for Starbucks, selling credit for its coffee and other offerings ahead of time is big business. We're talking billion-dollar business, because that's what customers routinely leave on their cards at any given time.

Quartr reports that, in 2023, the stored value of Starbucks cards sat at a whopping $1.6 billion. This includes both physical and digital cards, which are stored on the mobile app. So, it's safe to say that, much like the popular practice of customizing your drink order, Starbucks is a big fan of gift card purchases, because all that unspent Starbucks card money is like a loan that the company doesn't have to pay interest on.

The Starbucks Q4 2024 fiscal report put the stored card value at $1.78 billion at the end of 2024, which means that the amount of money held on Starbucks cards has continued to increase every year except for a slight dip in 2019 and 2020 (per Quartr). To put this into perspective, that's enough money on Starbucks cards to buy every single person in the U.S. an Iced Tall Cinnamon Dolce Latte, though they'd have to cover their own tax.

Much of the Starbucks stored card value is actually the balance that customers keep on the mobile card on the app. That way, even if they don't have cash or available money on a debit card, they can still get that coffee fix. The Starbucks mobile app has been around for over 15 years now, and it's seen some massive changes. When it first started, the app could tell customers about store locations, the Starbucks menu, and had a drink builder to assist with ordering. Now, it serves as a mobile Starbucks card that you can use to pay for drinks in the app or in the store. It also tracks Starbucks Rewards that are earned when making purchases.

You can add physical gift cards to the app, too, so that even if the card gets lost, the cash on it doesn't. While it's hard to say how much of Starbucks' stored card value comes from the mobile app, CNN Business reports that 70% of the coffee company's sales come through the mobile app and drive-thru. We can definitely see why using the app to order drinks and other items from Starbucks is so popular. Using the right tips and hacks can lead to more Reward points, which then leads to discounts and even free items.",https://www.tastingtable.com/img/gallery/the-incredible-amount-of-unspent-starbucks-gift-cards-people-are-hanging-on-to/l-intro-1752081002.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:44.163329

The document showcases the Group’s continued evolution of a sustainability-centered management strategy, highlighting measurable achievements across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions.

The report outlines comprehensive progress across key areas, including a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, expanded use of renewable energy, increased adoption of certified materials, enhanced product authentication through blockchain technology, and impactful initiatives in human capital and community engagement.

31% Emissions Reduction and 100% Renewable Energy in Europe and North America

On the environmental front, OTB reported a 31% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) compared to 2023. In addition, all directly managed sites in Europe and North America—including offices and stores—achieved 100% renewable energy usage. Globally, the share of renewable energy reached 70%, and the Group’s emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a global standard for climate action in business.

Expanding the Use of Certified and Low-Impact Materials

Progress was also evident in sustainable sourcing. In 2024, 24% of all raw materials purchased by OTB were certified. Notably, preferred cotton—organic, regenerative, and recycled—accounted for 62% of total cotton use, marking a 31% increase from the previous year. This shift reflects a Group-wide commitment to circularity, transparency, and responsible design embedded across its brand portfolios.

Blockchain-Based Authentication and Anti-Counterfeiting Efforts

OTB has also advanced in its technological initiatives. As a Steering Member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium alongside LVMH, the Prada Group, and Cartier (Richemont), OTB issued over 1.8 million digital certificates of authenticity between 2022 and 2024 for products from Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni. These certificates allow customers to verify product authenticity and trace origins via smartphone.

In parallel, the Group intensified efforts to combat counterfeiting. In 2024 alone, more than 23,000 illicit pieces of content were removed from social media, and over 60,000 counterfeit listings for its brands were taken down from online marketplaces.

Diesel’s Circularity Strategy Earns International Recognition

Diesel continues to lead the charge in circular fashion. Its initiatives—including Diesel Rehab Denim and Diesel Second Hand—along with a recycling collaboration involving its supply chain and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), earned the brand the Circular Economy Award from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation during the 2024 Sustainable Fashion Awards hosted by the National Chamber for Italian Fashion.

Gender Equity, Talent Development, and Corporate Volunteering

OTB’s investment in human capital remains central to its strategy. In 2024, the share of women in managerial roles reached 54.7%, enabling the Group to renew its gender equality certification. Meanwhile, the internal training program “Scuola dei Mestieri” continued to support the next generation of Made in Italy artisans, with over 85% of participants hired by OTB companies.

The newly launched “Brave to Care” corporate volunteering program also saw participation from over 130 employees, who contributed more than 700 hours of service to eight charitable organizations across Italy. The initiative further strengthens the link between the company, its people, and the communities it serves.

Multi-Layered Social Impact through OTB Foundation

The OTB Foundation continued to serve as the cornerstone of the Group’s social responsibility agenda in 2024. Key projects included the “OTB Chiama Alice” free online mental health service for youth, the expansion of support for families in economic hardship, and refugee integration through employment-focused programs.

One standout initiative was “Brave Business in a Bus,” the first mobile incubator supporting female entrepreneurship in Afghanistan. The program enables women in Kabul to launch small businesses from home by providing comprehensive training, business tools, and practical lessons.

OTB Group’s slogan, “Be Responsible. Be Brave,” is more than just a catchphrase—it functions as a core value embedded in the company’s foundation. By driving transformation across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, OTB presents a compelling model for what the next phase of sustainability in the fashion industry can look like.

The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.","(The Hill) — Hospitals are bracing for the impact of the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s sweeping spending and tax cut law.

While most of the cuts won’t happen immediately, rural facilities in particular say they likely will have to make difficult financial decisions about which services they can afford to keep and which may need to be cut.

Hospitals loudly raised alarms about the legislation, but their warnings went unheeded, and now they say they will bear the brunt of the changes.

The new law cuts about $1 trillion from Medicaid, primarily through stringent work requirements as well as reductions to how states can fund their Medicaid programs through provider taxes and state-directed payments.

Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid funding because many of the patients they care for are low-income.

“Restrictions on state-directed payments and provider taxes cut off critical financial lifelines for hospitals,” Bruce Siegel, president and CEO of America’s Essential Hospitals, said in a statement.

“State-directed payments are a critical source of support for hospitals, particularly in rural areas, and provider taxes help reduce the gap between Medicaid and other payers, ensuring that physicians can take Medicaid patients and hospitals can be adequately staffed. Cutting these lifelines is not sustainable, and it will harm patients.”

More than 300 rural hospitals in the U.S. are at risk of closing down because of the bill, according to research conducted by the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center for Health Services Research and released last month by Democratic lawmakers.

Rural hospitals already operate on thin margins. The law’s Medicaid cuts will lead to more uninsured patients, meaning rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients, according to the report. In turn, they will face deeper financial strain.

Medicaid-dependent services — like labor and delivery units, mental health care, and emergency rooms — are some of the least profitable, yet most essential, services that hospitals provide. But experts said those will likely be cut as hospitals try to stay afloat.

In rural communities, Medicaid covers nearly half of all births and one-fifth of inpatient discharges, according to health research group KFF.

Republicans pushed back the start date for the provider tax reductions until 2028, and they won’t be fully phased in until 2031. The bill was only signed into law on July 4, so hospitals said it’s too early for them to know specifics on which services they’ll have to cut back on.

But the discussions are underway because hospitals need to start planning.

“If they see a very negative outlook in terms of Medicaid revenue reductions, increases in uncompensated care costs, I think that will tip the scales towards cutting services, cutting staff, not hiring, not expanding,” said Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

Mark Nantz, president and chief executive officer of Valley Health System, oversees a network that includes six hospitals in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and West Virginia, ranging from a 495-bed regional facility in Winchester to a 36-bed facility in Front Royal, about 70 miles outside of Washington.

Nantz said Medicaid expansion and provider taxes have allowed the system to break even when taking care of Medicaid patients. Previously, they were losing about 25 cents on every dollar.

Once the cuts are fully phased in, Nantz said Valley Health will lose about $50 million a year in revenue for Medicaid patients. The most likely casualty will be new construction and expansion plans, but he said it’s too early to know more.

“We’re not in a situation where we need to knee-jerk because we’re a pretty stable healthcare system, but it’s definitely going to change the way we look at expanding and the types of services that we offer in our six hospitals,” Nantz said.

Valley Health was able to expand the services it offers because it was not losing money on Medicaid, but that may not be able to continue. While hospitals may not close, some types of specialty care may be moved from rural facilities and centralized at the regional facility.

“We’ve got, really, two and a half to three years to make those kinds of decisions and prepare for what we will do. So we’re not threatening to cut jobs or hospitals or service locations or any of that right now,” Nantz said. “But we have to look at whether or not we can continue” offering the same types of services.

Republicans concerned about the impact of the provider tax reduction on rural hospitals inserted a $50 billion relief fund into the law. The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.

The federal government will distribute half of the program’s $50 billion allotment equally among all states with an approved application over the next five years.

But experts said the money isn’t nearly enough to make up for the impact of the cuts. According to a KFF analysis, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas is estimated to decline by $155 billion over a decade.

The states and hospitals that will be hit the hardest will benefit the least, Park said.

He noted the law gives the Trump administration a lot of discretion on how they divide up the funds, so there’s potential for favoritism.

Every state has until the end of 2025 at the latest to apply for funds by submitting a “detailed rural health transformation plan” that addresses the program’s aims, according to the legislation.

But if CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz doesn’t agree with how states are using their funds, the law says he then “may withhold payments to, or reduce payments to, or recover previous payments from, the State.”

“It’s a fig leaf,” Park said. “The fund is temporary. These cuts are permanent.”",https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2025/07/AP25182757035200-e1752430683233.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:04.870775

A grave security bug was discovered in the hiring portal McHire, revealing the sensitive information of around 64 million applicants.

The most surprising aspect of this revelation was that the exceedingly ordinary and foreseeable password '123456' was employed on this system.

Security expert Ian Carroll and Sam Curry uncovered this security flaw. They discovered that there was an option to log in as ""Paradox team members"" on the admin panel of McHire. In it he attempted the default password and username '123456' and got access not only to the test server, but also the actual admin dashboard.

The researchers found an internal API endpoint from which information about any candidate could be obtained by entering only one predictable parameter. Not only this, some tokens were also found with the help of which any person could present himself in the identity of a candidate.

As soon as this report came out on June 30, McDonald's and its AI tech partner Paradox.ai took immediate action. By July 1, the default login credentials were disabled, and the related API was secured.

Maybe you still do.

The bi-weekly pay structure is how millions of Americans get paid, yet this structure is a huge stressor for lots of people.

💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵

With a paycheck always a few days or weeks ahead, one unexpected expense, like a car repair or a medical bill, can mean an overdraft at the bank or a massive credit card bill that is hard to repay.

The bi-weekly pay structure is also one reason companies like Dollar Loan Center, MoneyMutual, and Advance America — businesses that offer short-term “paycheck” loans — have thrived over the years, even though they frequently face accusations of predatory lending practices.

Now, a new study reveals insight that might make employers reconsider how they manage this part of their business.

Bi‑weekly pay leads to chronic stress

The current pay structure has hidden consequences. Workers must manage bill due dates and budget for food, rent, phone, internet, etc., all while wondering whether their next check will cover it.

For hourly workers who don't have much savings, the cycle can create a frenzy of short-term financial triage.

The constant financial juggling can take a toll on mental health, straining relationships and reducing productivity at work — all of which is bad for employers.

In a recent Talker Research-commissioned survey, conducted May 13-21, 2025, among 2,000 U.S. hourly workers, including 1,000 who work in retail, nearly 39% reported that living paycheck to paycheck with a consistent income would be an upgrade compared to their current financial situation — and 44% had recently overdrafted their account.

""For a long time, 'living paycheck to paycheck' was considered to be the lowest tier of financial wellness,"" a Talker Research spokesperson told TheStreet. ""In this tier, people aren't able to put their money into savings or level up financially because all their money is going toward immediate needs like rent and groceries. But now, the data shows that many aren't even able to live paycheck to paycheck, slipping into an even lower tier of financial wellness.""

The survey also found:

38% of hourly workers have less than $1,000 in savings.

19% of hourly workers took out loans in the past year to get through the pay cycle.

34% of hourly workers rely on two or more jobs to stay afloat.

Many resort to extreme measures — selling personal property or even dumpster diving — to survive, according to the survey.

This data suggests that current pay structures are both inconvenient and insufficient.

On‑demand pay is a preference for many, not just a perk

The solution may lie in on-demand pay, also known as “earned wage access” (EWA), where workers can access a portion of their earned wages before designated paydays.

Of course, there are dozens of companies competing for employers’ attention in this sector. DailyPay, Payactiv, Earnin, Branch, ZayZoon, and Wagestream are just a few of the EWA companies that have popped up in the last few years.

The survey found that 78% of workers believe having this option would stabilize their finances.

Among those already receiving on-demand wages, results are promising, per Talker Research:

22% of hourly workers used their wages for groceries and essentials;

20% of hourly workers avoided late or missed bill payments; and

15% of hourly workers reported lower financial stress.

These sorts of changes could also benefit employers. Since financial stress correlates with mental strain, absenteeism, and lower productivity, employers who rethink paydays could be rewarded with a stronger workforce.

While we wait for official numbers to come out for Q2 which just closed last Monday, June 30, the year was off to a stellar start when Q1 buybacks hit a record of $293B, according to S&P Global. The previous record was set in Q1 2022 when buybacks totaled $281B.[1] Analysts have said they expect 2025 to hit $1T in total buybacks.[2]

Buybacks remained top heavy, with the top 20 S&P 500 companies accounting for 48.4% of Q1 2025 buybacks, a slight decrease from 49% in Q4 2024. While the concentration amongst top stock repurchases still exists, more companies within the S&P 500 have been repurchasing stock as of late, and the number purchasing over 1% of their public stock has increased.[3] This story changes slightly when you look globally.

Total Number of Global Companies Announcing Buybacks is Lower

Despite the dollar level of buybacks hitting records, Wall Street Horizon data shows that the actual number of announcements has been relatively low, historically speaking. The second quarter closed out with 164 announcements, that comes after Q1 recorded 168 buyback announcements. The quarterly average over the last five years has been 204 announcements. You can see in the chart below that those numbers are steadily climbing after bottom-ing out in 2023.

An Age-Old Debate: Are Buybacks Good or Bad?

As interest rates fall, as many are expecting at the next Fed meeting on July 30, holding onto cash tends to become less attractive to corporations who want to deploy and put it to work. Typically, buybacks are a good thing for shareholders as well, as they artificially improve earnings per share of a company, if not actually improving earnings. Share repurchases come under fire for this reason as well, with many arguing that companies could have put the money to better use by investing it back into the company. Investors tend to prefer companies that are buying back shares while also investing in growth. A great example is the mega tech names, many of which are the largest buyers of their own stock, but also tend to invest heavily in research and development and AI, among other things.

The Bottom-Line

As the Q2 earnings season begins on Tuesday, July 15th with reports from major banks, investors should closely monitor buyback announcements. An increase in share repurchases would indicate corporate America's renewed willingness to deploy cash, which could have positive implications for the US economy.

For Albertsons Media Collective, the chain’s media arm, the physical store at Cannes, stocked with products ready to be sold, represented the ultimate goal: getting products off the shelves and into customers’ hands.

According to Evan Hovorka, VP, product and innovation, Albertsons Media Collective, their presence in Cannes “really reflects our DNA,” adding, “We exist to provide shoppers with cost-effective food solutions.” Hovorka said that bringing this mission to Cannes completes the circle, encompassing media, merchandising, and product sales.

In-store media network

Also at the festival, Albertsons Media Collective launched an in-store digital display network to provide brands and agencies “a more robust way for them to tell their story directly to our shoppers at the most important point of their decision-making process,” Hovorka said.

The network allows them to present creative media-driven narratives featuring recipes, sustainability programs, or new product launches.

The timing is crucial, said Hovorka. Customers are already in the store and ready to spend, making it an ideal moment to connect brands with shoppers. “There couldn’t be a more beautiful way to connect a brand to the shopper,” Hovorka said.

According to eMarketer, in-store retail media ad spending is projected to exceed $500 million in 2025, which supports the emphasis on connecting with shoppers at the point of sale.

Video ads complete the picture

Hovorka noted that the network features high-resolution video ad units distributed across stores, which he sees as an improvement over static images found in other retailers. While shelf tags and screen prints remain important components of a retail media network, “now we’ve got the most exciting missing piece, which is that inspirational video,” Hovorka said.

He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.” Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund.
I was so surprised as I just wanted to know why it took so long,” Mr Tay said.
When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.","SINGAPORE: McDonald’s Singapore has issued an apology after a customer complained about an unusually long wait time and an unpleasant exchange with a manager at its Hougang 1 outlet.

Mr Tay, who shared his experience with citizen journalism platform Stomp, said he had placed a takeaway order at the restaurant at 10.28pm on June 7. Despite initially waiting patiently, he only received his food at 11.16pm—48 minutes later.

According to Mr Tay, the store was busy when he arrived, so he did not mind waiting at first. However, by 10.55pm, he noticed that other customers who had ordered around the same time were already leaving.

“I asked an auntie at the counter about it. She told me to wait for my order as it was still being prepared,” Mr Tay told Stomp, “After 10 minutes, I asked her again. She told me to wait.”

When his order was eventually ready close to 11.16pm, Mr Tay requested to speak to the duty manager to understand the delay. What followed, he said, was an unpleasant encounter.

“The auntie told him about it, but he turned his head, ignored me and carried on doing his things,” Mr Tay wrote in his feedback to McDonald’s, “After that, the auntie called him again, and he unwillingly came to the counter.”

Mr Tay alleged that the manager’s demeanour quickly turned confrontational when he asked why the food had taken so long.

“He immediately started with a rude attitude, opening his eyes wide and talking like a gangster,” Mr Tay claimed, “He challenged me and asked why I couldn’t see that the store was busy—are the kitchen staff dancing? He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.”

Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund. He also expressed shock when the manager suggested he was being disrespectful.

“I asked him why he was so rude. He told me that I did not give him ‘face’ in front of other customers and staff. I was so surprised as I just wanted to know why it took so long,” Mr Tay said.

When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.

“He threw his name tag on the desk. When I wanted to take a picture of it, he timidly snatched it back and asked me to take a photo of the ‘shift manager on duty’,” Mr Tay recounted, “It was definitely a forgotten order and the manager was not apologetic at all.”

In his feedback, Mr Tay described the manager’s behaviour as “frightening” and said the entire episode left him “a very disappointed customer”.

McDonald’s Singapore has since apologised over the episode. A spokesperson told Stomp, “We’re sorry to hear about what happened and have since reached out to make things right. Consistent service matters to us, and we’ve taken steps—including reinforcing training with our team—to help prevent this from happening again.”

Mr Tay later confirmed that McDonald’s had contacted him, apologised, and refunded the cost of the meal. Reflecting on the outcome, he said: “Social media power is very fantastic.”",https://media.theindependent.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-13-021013.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:05:57.112999

The newsroom approaches each quarter with a nervous energy, but this summer it feels especially heightened. Recent market records in both the U.S. and Europe, alongside an unpredictable economic environment, paint a complicated picture for the second half.

It all kicks off on Tuesday with America's banking behemoths, as attention switches from the White House back to Wall Street.

But U.S. President Donald Trump's policies still loom large, with Goldman Sachs predicting that, this quarter, U.S. earnings will start to show the impact of the tariffs.

The investment bank's economists see ""conflicting messages on the margin outlook"" as companies have only announced modest price increases, despite the cost hikes associated with higher tariffs.

Earnings-per-share growth is also set to come under pressure, with Goldman suggesting, ""the consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies' earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year — down from 12% in the first quarter.""

With the banks set to dominate next week — JPMorgan , Citi , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are all reporting within just two days — maybe Europe can provide some optimism.

As reported by CNBC's Jenni Reid, European banks just recorded their best first half since 1997. Gains were driven by strong investment banking returns — something their U.S. counterparts are also likely to capitalize on — as well as stock rallies based on both deal speculation and actual M&A.

As someone who grew up in Cape Town, seeing this year's G20 meetings take place in South Africa makes me pine for the sunshine of the Southern hemisphere.

Next week's meeting in Durban between finance ministers and central bank governors comes at an interesting time for the country.

An Oval Office meeting between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Trump went spectacularly wrong back in May, when the latter, flanked by his South African (now former) right-hand man Elon Musk, made false claims of a ""white genocide.""

It seems tensions have not abated.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will skip the meeting altogether, opting to head to Japan instead, according to Reuters. South Africa is also subject to a new 30% tariff rate, the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to be singled out in the latest round of announcements.

It does not bode well for the G20 Leaders meeting, due to be held in Gauteng on Nov. 22-23. It remains to be seen if Trump will attend.

Consumer demand and green policies are speeding up the shift to low-carbon steel. Partnerships with officials ensure funding for hydrogen-based tech and carbon capture. It’s a team effort—businesses and lawmakers are driving the change together.

Hybrit

Hybrit already shipped fossil-free steel samples to Volvo, proving green steel can work today. By 2026, this Swedish venture aims to flip the switch to full-scale production, swapping coal for hydrogen in the iron-making process.

The company’s pilot plant runs on clean energy and water electrolysis technology—no blast furnace smokestacks here. If their model catches on, steel could shed its dirty reputation faster than you’d think.

Delivered fossil-free steel prototypes to Volvo

Hybrit made history by delivering the first batch of fossil-free steel to Volvo. The steel was used for prototypes, marking a major step toward cleaner production. Instead of coal, Hybrit uses green hydrogen in its process, cutting carbon emissions drastically.

Volvo aims to build cars with this low-carbon steel by 2026. The shift could reshape auto manufacturing while fighting climate change. No coke oven gas or blast furnaces are needed, just clean electricity and hydrogen-based tech.

A game-changer for heavy industry!

Plans for commercial production by 2026

Hybrit aims to roll out commercial green steel production by 2026. The company already delivered fossil-free steel prototypes to Volvo, proving hydrogen-based reduction works.

This push puts Hybrit ahead of many competitors in the race for low-carbon steel. The shift hinges on scaling hydrogen production and securing clean energy sources. Costs and infrastructure remain hurdles, but the 2026 target shows serious momentum.

Baosteel

Baosteel plans to roll out low-carbon steel for Chinese markets starting in 2024. The company focuses on hydrogen-based tech and cleaner production methods to cut emissions.

Big companies are teaming up to buy green steel, pushing suppliers to go green faster. This buying power acts like a turbo boost for clean steel tech.

Think of it as carmakers and builders joining forces to rewrite the rules of steel shopping—with their wallets doing the talking.

Driving demand for green steel through purchasing power

The First Movers Coalition (FMC) pushes companies to buy green steel early. Over 95 firms, including GM, Ford, and Volvo, joined after COP26 in 2021. Their goal is simple: purchase at least 10% near-zero carbon steel by 2030.

This creates demand for cleaner production methods like hydrogen-based DRI and electric arc furnaces.

Automakers and manufacturers hold major buying power in the steel industry. By committing to low-carbon options, they push suppliers to innovate faster. The FMC proves that collective purchasing can speed up decarbonization efforts without waiting for policy changes alone.

Cost remains a hurdle, but big buyers signal market readiness for greener alternatives like fossil-free steel and recycled materials.

Collaboration between automakers and manufacturers

Big names like GM, Ford, and Volvo are teaming up with steel producers through the First Movers Coalition. Their goal? To boost demand for green steel by using their buying power to push for cleaner options.

Automakers want low-carbon steel for cars, while manufacturers aim to cut emissions. Together, they’re speeding up the shift to hydrogen-based production and electric arc furnaces powered by renewables.

This partnership helps make green steel more affordable and available by 2030.

Innovations Driving Green Steel Production

New tech is shaking up steelmaking, with hydrogen-based DRI and electric arc furnaces stealing the spotlight. Companies are betting big on renewables to power these cleaner methods, turning old-school smelters into lean, green machines.

Hydrogen-based Direct Reduced Iron (H2-DRI)

Hydrogen-based Direct Reduced Iron (H2-DRI) is a game-changer for green steel. It replaces coal with hydrogen to cut emissions. In this process, hydrogen reacts with iron ore in a DRI tower, leaving just water vapor as waste.

Companies like H2 Green Steel use electrolysis to make hydrogen from water and renewable power.

The technology slashes carbon footprints by skipping fossil fuels. Unlike traditional methods, it avoids CO₂-heavy blast furnaces. Renewable energy powers the electric arc furnaces that melt the iron.

This combo—clean hydrogen and green electricity—puts low-carbon steel within reach by 2030.

Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) powered by renewable energy

Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) melt scrap steel using renewable electricity, cutting carbon emissions. Unlike traditional blast furnaces, they don’t burn coal, making them cleaner for green steel production.

H2 Green Steel’s plant in Boden, Sweden, runs entirely on renewable power, showing how EAFs can slash CO₂ emissions.

These furnaces work fast and fit well with wind and solar energy. Paired with hydrogen-based reduction tech or recycled steel, EAFs help create low-carbon steel faster. The challenge? High costs and needing steady clean power.

But as grids go greener, so will the steel industry.

Recycling and circularity initiatives

Steel recycling cuts carbon emissions and boosts the circular economy. KIRCHHOFF and H2 Green Steel plan to feed at least 30% of scrap steel back into electric arc furnaces, slashing waste and energy use.

Old steel gets a second life, reducing the need for new raw materials. This lowers the carbon footprint of production while saving costs. Scrap melts faster in furnaces, needing less power.

It’s a win for green energy goals and cleaner steel manufacturing.

Challenges in Scaling Green Steel

Making green steel isn’t cheap, and high production costs still slow down progress. Finding enough hydrogen and building new infrastructure also stand in the way of scaling up fast.

High production costs

Making green steel isn’t cheap. The tech needed, like hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (H2-DRI) and electric arc furnaces (EAF), costs way more than traditional methods. Clean energy inputs, like green hydrogen or renewable electricity, also drive prices up compared to fossil fuels.

Securing enough low-carbon hydrogen adds another hurdle. Right now, producing it through steam methane reforming with carbon capture or electrolysis is expensive without subsidies.

Smaller firms face tough competition from big players who can afford the high capital expenditure for scaling up fast. The European Green Deal helps but doesn’t erase the gap overnight.

Prices must drop before green steel can compete globally against cheaper, dirtier options tied to volatile oil prices or OPEC+ supply chains.

Infrastructure requirements

Green steel needs big changes in infrastructure. Factories must switch to hydrogen-based reduction tech and electric arc furnaces powered by renewable electricity. New facilities require massive investments, like H2 Green Steel’s $3 billion plant in Sweden.

Transport and storage of green hydrogen add another hurdle. Pipelines and ports must adapt to handle this clean fuel. Countries like Germany and China are already upgrading grids and storage to support low-carbon steel production.

Without these fixes, scaling up remains tough.

Securing hydrogen supply

Hydrogen supply is a major hurdle for green steel production. Making enough hydrogen from renewable energy, like solar or wind power, requires massive investments in electrolyzers and infrastructure.

Without it, companies can’t replace fossil fuels in processes like Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) production.

Countries and firms are racing to scale up green hydrogen projects, but costs remain high. Some producers rely on carbon capture and storage (CCS) with natural gas as a stopgap. The goal? Shift fully to clean hydrogen by 2030 to cut carbon emissions in steelmaking for good.

Takeaways

The race for green steel is heating up, with eight firms leading the charge. These companies use hydrogen, renewable power, and smart tech to slash emissions. Costs remain high, but partnerships and new laws are speeding up progress.

Every ton of green steel cuts global carbon footprints. The shift won’t be easy, but the payoff is huge. The future of steel is green, and it’s coming fast.

To combat slowing sales, Starbucks hired former Chipotle executive Brian Niccol as its chair and CEO in August. Niccol addressed the situation directly at the time, saying, “It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers.""

Niccol named the company's new ""Back to Starbucks"" plan as the key to that change, saying, ""My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back.""

Part of the company's plan is to attract consumers back to Starbucks as a community gathering space, moving away from the quick-speed tweaks it implemented in prior years.

Since announcing the plan, Starbucks has made a variety of other changes, including writing on cups again, bringing back the condiment bar, ditching the non-dairy upcharge, and adding additional coverage hours in 3,000 of its locations.

In addition to all those tweaks, it's also got a new drink coming to weather the hottest part of summer.

Starbucks has a new take on cold brew

Since it's the hottest time of the year, Starbucks has decided it's time to deliver something exciting with a tasty new spin on a coffee classic: the cold brew.

As we reported previously, Starbucks is bringing back a raspberry syrup it originally discontinued in 2023.

“Starbucks will also be bringing back raspberry syrup for a very limited time this July to delight fans, and the company plans to bring more flavor drops in the future,” the company said in a June 10 news release.

However, Starbucks also has a new drink coming, which it hasn't yet revealed: a Raspberry Cream cold brew, as reporter by food blogger Markie Devo via his X account on July 10.

Devo says that several employees have told him the new drink is coming, which is the chain's signature coffee sweetened with vanilla syrup and topped with a raspberry cream cold foam.

Devo originally reported that the drink could come out on July 24 for rewards members and July 29 nationwide, but it looks like those dates have been changed just a bit, as now the new drink drops for a limited time on July 28.

Starbucks employees sound off on the changes

While Niccol promises the Back to Starbucks program will transform the brand, there's one group of people who don't love the changes: the baristas.

The Starbucks subreddit features a fair number of complaints about the new policies, with one focused heavily on the return to writing on cups.

""WRITING ON CUPS IS STUPID. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY. It slows us down, no one likes doing it, being coached for not doing it is ridiculous, the customers don’t f**king care,"" wrote one user, who also claimed the practice was unsanitary.

Another user called out the menu simplification, calling Niccol's ordered changes ""laughable.""

""Sure, he took away some pastries (but added some),"" the user wrote. ""Took away creme based frappuccinos which are still being ordered, which are now simply harder and more time consuming to ring up (which makes it more difficult to meet their strict ""peak"" time crunches).

Soybean oil is being used as a sustainable replacement for petroleum and other oils in tire sidewalls.

Firestone uses racing as a testing ground for new tire technologies before implementing them in consumer tires.

NEWTON—Tires made in part with soybeans grown in Iowa will be coming soon to Firestone stores.

Firestone, IndyCar's tire manufacturer, tests tire technology by using it first in its IndyCar tires before making it more widely available in consumer tires. The company is owned by Bridgestone Americas, which employs 700 people at its Des Moines Agricultural Tire Plant. The plant also makes Firestone tires for tractors.

Cara Krstolic, Firestone race tire engineering and production executive director, said that Firestone's consumer tires — whether manufactured for cars or tractors — share some materials with its racing tires. In 2022, Firestone introduced an alternative tire made from guayule, a plant that grows in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico, to use on street courses. More recently, Firestone added soybean oil to its race tires.

Soybean oil is used in sidewalls of tires, and the company is experimenting with other uses for it, Krstolic said.

""Leftover residual oil from the soybean can be used to replace petroleum,"" Krstolic said. ""And it can also work on reducing some of our other oils in the tires.""

Soybeans are also more renewable than other plants Firestone has experimented with, she said.

""The nice thing about the soybean is that there's enough sources that you can get that (and) you're not competing as food source,"" Krstolic said. ""

Among the products Firestone makes at Bridgestone's Des Moines factory are tractor tires, which sit on a tractor in Victory Lane.

Since its inception, car and tire manufacturers have used racing to test products before rolling sales out to consumers. Firestone founder Harvey Firestone coined the phrase, ""Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.""

Each race weekend Firestone brings about 20 people to mount tires and six engineers to monitor tire temperatures and other data on tires. Eventually all of this work at Iowa Speedway and IndyCar's 15 other tracks makes it into consumer tires, Krstolic said.

""Racing is a mobile lab,"" Krstolic said. ""Where else can you see the extremes of heat and durability and performance than on race tracks?... So there are materials that we'll put into this race and other races that we can prove out at speeds of 200 mph.""

The bank's Q2 2025 earnings, to be released on July 17, will offer critical insights into its ability to navigate challenges such as declining interest rates and rising costs while maintaining peer-leading returns. Under CEO Gunjan Kedia's leadership, the bank is executing a multi-pronged strategy to enhance profitability, expand digitally, and capitalize on partnerships—all hallmarks of a resilient outperformer.

Leadership Transition Fuels Strategic Focus

Kedia's April 2025 appointment as CEO marked a pivotal shift. A veteran of the bank's corporate and investment divisions, she has prioritized operational discipline and growth through technology and partnerships. Alongside CFO John Stern, she has outlined ambitious targets: boosting the net interest margin (NIM) to over 3% from 2.72% in Q1 2025 and cutting costs via four new initiatives. These moves align with her vision to balance risk management with aggressive pursuit of revenue synergies from the Union Bank acquisition. Analysts note her potential to accelerate digital transformation, a critical edge in an industry increasingly defined by fintech disruption.

Strategic Initiatives: Efficiency and Digital Growth

U.S. Bancorp's Q2 focus hinges on two pillars: optimizing its existing customer base and leveraging partnerships to drive capital-light growth. The bank's Q1 ROTCE of 17.5%—up from 16.5% in Q1 2024—demonstrates operational leverage, but sustaining this will require execution on cost-saving measures and NIM expansion.

The partnership with Fiserv, announced in June, is a case in point. Integrating U.S. Bank's Elan credit card program into Fiserv's Credit Choice platform creates a seamless digital experience for consumers and small businesses. This collaboration, set to fully convert by year-end, reduces operational friction and expands U.S. Bancorp's reach without physical branch investments. Similarly, its long-running partnership with State Farm—now offering co-branded credit cards and loans—has generated 120,000 accounts in 2023 alone, showcasing the power of third-party networks to scale efficiently.

Navigating Challenges: Cost Discipline and Interest Rate Headwinds

The bank faces headwinds, including gradual interest rate cuts and rising expenses. U.S. Bancorp's Q1 noninterest expense rose 3.5% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, a trend it aims to reverse through cost-saving measures. The goal is an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s by 2026-2027, down from 60.8% in Q1 2025.

On NIM, the bank is countering rate pressures through loan growth (up 0.9% Q/Q to $381.8 billion) and deposit optimization. Its strategy to reduce reliance on high-cost deposits and favor loan growth—particularly in commercial and corporate segments—should help achieve the 3% NIM target. However, the Federal Reserve's potential cuts later this year could test this approach.

Valuation and Investment Considerations

At current levels, U.S. Bancorp's stock trades at 1.6x tangible book value, below its five-year average of 1.8x, suggesting undervaluation relative to peers. Its dividend yield of 2.8%—supported by a strong capital position (Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.8% in Q1)—offers stability.

Investors should monitor Q2 results for progress on:

1. NIM expansion and cost-saving execution.

2. Noninterest income growth (targeted at 5% annually).

3. Loan growth trends and credit quality metrics.

Risks include prolonged rate cuts, which could pressure NII, and execution delays in digital partnerships. Yet, the bank's fortress balance sheet (nonperforming assets at 0.45% in Q1) and ethical reputation—ranked among the 2025 World's Most Ethical Companies—provide a safety net.

Conclusion: A Resilient Outperformer

U.S. Bancorp's strategic moves under Kedia position it as a resilient competitor in an evolving banking landscape. Its focus on digital innovation, cost discipline, and partnerships reduces reliance on traditional branch expansion, while its financial metrics—ROTEC and efficiency ratio—signal operational strength. While challenges remain, the bank's execution could validate its undervalued stock, making it a compelling pick for investors seeking stability in a volatile sector.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:02:58.975268

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future.","The retail landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by rising theft, evolving consumer expectations, and the relentless march of e-commerce. At the epicenter of this transformation stands Walmart, whose bold moves to combat theft and dominate online grocery sales offer a blueprint for retailers navigating today's challenges. By integrating physical and digital strategies while addressing loss prevention, Walmart is redefining the rules of the game—and investors would be wise to take note.

The Anti-Theft Tightrope: Balancing Security and Trust

Walmart's recent anti-theft initiatives—locking meats in tamper-resistant cages, deploying AI-driven checkout systems, and embedding hidden barcodes—aim to stem losses that cost U.S. retailers $61 billion annually. These measures have sparked public outcry, with critics calling Walmart's “imprisoned” food displays a betrayal of its value-driven ethos. TikTok users and consumer advocacy groups have amplified concerns, citing a 16.5% rise in discrimination complaints linked to intrusive security practices.

Yet, Walmart's actions are strategic. Theft at self-checkouts has surged by 30% since 2020, and the company cannot afford to cede ground to competitors or erode margins further. The operational costs of these changes—new technologies, staff training, and potential declines in customer convenience—are substantial. However, Walmart's scale and infrastructure (e.g., 4,700 U.S. stores) allow it to absorb these expenses while maintaining its dominance.

The E-Commerce Edge: Walmart's 31.6% Market Share Lead

Walmart's true advantage lies in its omnichannel strategy. With 31.6% of the U.S. online grocery market—$63.79 billion in projected 2025 sales—the company outpaces Amazon (22.6%) and Instacart (21.6%) by prioritizing value, convenience, and integration. Its Walmart+ membership program, which offers free delivery and cash-back incentives, has driven a 21% year-over-year global e-commerce sales growth. Meanwhile, delivery costs per order have dropped nearly 40%, thanks to AI-optimized logistics and store-fulfilled orders.

The data underscores Walmart's resilience:

While Amazon's Prime ecosystem and Instacart's delivery network remain formidable, Walmart's physical-digital hybrid model—where 72.2% of its online sales flow directly through its own platform—gives it an edge in controlling pricing, inventory, and customer experience. Shoppers, particularly cost-conscious families, reward this integration: Walmart's average order value exceeds competitors' by 20%.

Competitive Dynamics: Why Walmart's Playbook Works

Amazon and Instacart face structural limitations. Amazon's grocery sales, though growing, rely heavily on one-off purchases (e.g., toiletries), whereas Walmart dominates full-basket shopping. Instacart, while the top delivery intermediary (57.7% of U.S. delivery sales), struggles as retailers like Walmart and Kroger build in-house logistics to reduce reliance on third parties.

Walmart's strategy also addresses a key consumer shift: the demand for seamless omnichannel experiences. Its 2025 delivery share rose nearly 8 percentage points year-over-year, and its pickup services remain preferred by 45.5% of shoppers. By leveraging generative AI for dynamic pricing and personalized recommendations, Walmart is not just keeping pace but setting the pace.

Investment Implications: Betting on Loss Prevention and Omnichannel Mastery

Walmart's moves signal a broader industry trend: retailers must prioritize loss prevention and omnichannel integration to thrive. Investors should favor companies that:

1. Control the end-to-end customer journey (e.g., Walmart's integrated stores and apps).

2. Invest in AI and automation to reduce costs and enhance customer experience.

3. Maintain low prices without sacrificing margins through supply chain efficiency.

Walmart's stock, currently trading at $152.30 (as of July 2025), offers a compelling entry point. Its dividend yield of 1.2% and consistent e-commerce growth (outpacing overall revenue) make it a defensive play in a volatile market. Meanwhile, Amazon's reliance on high-margin digital services and Instacart's dependency on retailer partnerships leave them exposed to margin pressures and competition.

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail

Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future. By balancing security with convenience, leveraging scale to absorb costs, and owning the customer experience from shelf to doorstep, Walmart is proving that the winners of the retail revolution will be those who master both physical and digital worlds. For investors, this is a signal to back retailers with similar strategies: those who innovate without losing sight of their core values.

In a sector where theft, convenience, and trust are existential battlegrounds, Walmart's resilience is a harbinger of things to come. The question isn't whether the retail revolution will succeed—it's already here. The answer is who will lead it. For now, the answer is Walmart.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 12:09:56.415167

Because the researchers who found these vulnerabilities, Ian Carroll and Sam Curry, were able to guess the password used by ""Paradox team members"" to access McHire: ""123456."" That's slightly better than the password I used, I guess, but not enough to justify its use decades after most people realized that using weak passwords is a bad idea.

There is some good news: ""It turned out we had become the administrator of a test restaurant inside the McHire system,"" Carroll and Curry wrote. ""We could see all of the employees of the restaurant were simply employees of Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire. This was great because we could now see how the app worked, but annoying because we had still not demonstrated any actual confidentiality or integrity impact.""

That's where the second vulnerability comes in. (Or the first, depending on whether or not you count the embarrassingly bad password as a true vuln.) An insecure direct object reference (IDOR) flaw in the McHire API allowed Carroll and Curry to gain access to the following information from ""every chat interaction [from anyone who] ever applied for a job at McDonald’s"":

Name, email address, phone number, address

Candidacy state and every state change/form input the candidate had submitted (shifts they could work, etc)

Auth token to log into the consumer UI as that user, leaking their raw chat messages and presumably other information

Carroll and Curry noted that Paradox had previously bragged that 90% of McDonald's franchises were using McHire as part of their hiring practices. (That link still leads to the appropriate post on Paradox's blog, but the section related to McDonald's has been removed, and neither the Wayback Machine nor Google's cache has saved old versions of the post. Weird!)

So let's compare and contrast. I secured a forum account with the password ""1234"" when I was a teenager; that account's compromise was ultimately meaningless. Paradox raised $200 million in 2020, McDonald's has a $213 billion market cap, and McHire's flaws exposed information about tens of millions of people. But at least their password was two characters longer!

Perhaps the only bright side is that Carroll and Curry said the McHire vulnerabilities were addressed a day after their disclosure. Hopefully the companies involved will hold themselves to a McHigher standard now.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBqPkqxoqRvnkMAvWbk3JD.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:10:59.921501

Recognized as Africa’s largest airline and one of the fastest-growing global aviation brands, Ethiopian Airlines continues to embody an African success story — one that has translated a bold vision into a world-class reality over the past eight decades. The airline currently serves over 160 passenger and cargo destinations across five continents.

More than just a carrier, Ethiopian plays a strategic role in connecting Africa to the rest of the world.

Vision 2035 is rooted in a commitment to safe, secure, market-responsive, and customer-focused services across a diverse portfolio that includes passenger and cargo operations, logistics, aviation training, airport management, ground handling, aircraft maintenance (MRO), aerospace manufacturing, and travel and tourism.

CEO Mesfin stated that the airline is implementing the roadmap with an emphasis on “fast and profitable growth.” Key components of this effort include network expansion, fleet modernization, and enhanced operational efficiency.

“As part of this strategy, we’ve continued to open new routes,” he said, citing recent additions such as Sharjah (UAE), Hyderabad (India), Oporto (Portugal), and Hanoi (Vietnam). He noted that Ethiopian inaugurated its Hanoi route this Thursday, underscoring its ongoing global expansion.

Increasing the frequency of flights to existing destinations also remains a key focus, Mesfin added. He revealed that the airline is actively exploring new long-haul opportunities, including a potential launch of services to Australia. A feasibility study for that route is currently underway.

On fleet development, Mesfin confirmed that Ethiopian has placed orders for approximately 120 new aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus. These include Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the next-generation 777X, along with Airbus A350s. The airline is also currently receiving deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX, with two aircraft received last month and more scheduled for arrival.

To enhance its regional capacity, the airline is evaluating options for acquiring additional 100-seat aircraft, with new orders expected to be placed soon.

Beyond fleet and route expansion, Ethiopian is also deepening its global footprint through strategic partnerships. The CEO disclosed that the airline is currently collaborating with four foreign carriers and remains open to additional joint ventures.

“Several countries have expressed interest in partnering with us to establish their own national carriers,” he told local news agency ENA. “Our approach typically begins with a feasibility study to assess the viability of such initiatives.”

Ethiopian Airlines’ strategic momentum signals a continued rise as a global aviation leader, firmly anchored in its African identity and driven by innovation, connectivity, and resilience.",https://www.fanamc.com/english/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1752393614098-1024x585.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:09:23.491334

In a shocking cybersecurity lapse, McDonald’s AI-powered hiring tool reportedly exposed the personal data of more than 64 million job applicants — all because it was secured with the world’s most infamous password: “123456”.

The vulnerability was discovered last month by security researchers who, out of curiosity, decided to probe the fast food giant’s recruitment chatbot after a Reddit thread highlighted how poorly it was responding to job seekers.

According to WIRED, they shared the details of the breach on Wednesday (9 July), and McDonald’s has also confirmed that they have patched the security risk.

Researcher gains access to personal data using default login credentials

Security expert Ian Carroll detailed the breach in a blog post, explaining that he was drawn to investigate McHire, McDonald’s AI recruitment system, after seeing a Reddit post about its chatbot, Olivia.

The Reddit post shared a frustrating interaction between a job applicant and the AI chatbot, with the bot giving nonsensical answers.

After just a few hours, he and fellow researcher Sam Curry stumbled upon a serious flaw — they could log in using default admin credentials, where both the username and password were simply “123456”.

This granted them full access to a database containing the private information of more than 64 million applicants, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

Breach reported, vulnerability fixed within hours

Upon discovering the flaw, the researchers immediately contacted Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire, and McDonald’s. The alert was sent on 30 June, prompting swift action.

Paradox.ai patched the vulnerability within hours, later confirming in a blog post that no unauthorised parties accessed the system, and that the only individuals who did were the two ethical researchers.

They also pledged to launch a bug bounty programme to catch such issues in future.

“We do not take this matter lightly, even though it was resolved swiftly and effectively,” they told WIRED. “We own this.”

Meanwhile, McDonald’s agreed that Paradox.ai were to blame.

“We’re disappointed by this unacceptable vulnerability from a third-party provider, Paradox.ai. As soon as we learned of the issue, we mandated Paradox.ai to remediate the issue immediately, and it was resolved on the same day it was reported to us,” the fast food chain said.

This week, Wall Street is gearing up for the second-quarter earnings season, with major banks and household names like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, and Netflix set to report their financials. Amidst the earnings releases, trade developments, including President Donald Trump's tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, will continue to draw significant attention from investors and financial professionals. The economic calendar is also busy, with inflation and retail sales reports scheduled for release.

Second-Quarter Earnings Season

The earnings season is expected to kick off with a bang, as major U.S. corporations, including banks and pharmaceutical companies, are set to release their financial results. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, among other major banks, will report their earnings, providing insights into the financial health of the banking sector. Johnson & Johnson, a leading pharmaceutical company, is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.66 per share, indicating a decline of 5.7% compared to the year-ago period [3]. Analysts forecast revenues of $22.79 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% year over year.

Trade Developments

The ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump will continue to be a focal point for investors. The U.S. has implemented tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, which have the potential to disrupt global supply chains and impact corporate earnings. The impact of these tariffs will be closely watched by investors and financial analysts, as they could influence the performance of companies and sectors that are heavily exposed to international trade.

Economic Calendar

The economic calendar is packed with important releases this week. On Tuesday, July 15, the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released, which could provide clues about the future of interest rates. The CPI is expected to show a monthly rise of 0.23% and a year-over-year increase of 2.6% [2]. Additionally, retail sales data will be released on Wednesday, July 16, which will give insights into consumer spending habits.

Conclusion

This week promises to be a busy one for Wall Street, with second-quarter earnings season in full swing and a packed economic calendar. Investors and financial professionals will be closely monitoring the earnings reports and economic data releases to gauge the health of the economy and make informed investment decisions.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate.

“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.","The U.S. will implement 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective Aug. 1, according to letters President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday morning.

The announcements come amid a rush of country-specific duty proclamations from Trump, covering many of the country's top trading partners, including Canada, Brazil, Japan and South Korea. All tariffs are slated to start Aug. 1.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate. He also called attention to security topics, like cartel activity within Mexico and its link to U.S. fentanyl trafficking within the letter.

Since early March, imports from Mexico, like those from Canada, have been subject to a 25% tariff unless they qualify for United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement treatment.

The Saturday letter to Mexico does not clarify whether the USMCA exemption will continue under the new tariff rate, nor whether the 35% duty will replace the original 25% levy.

Since the country-specific tariffs were first announced, officials from Mexico have often sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship and secure preferential treatment on tariffs, rather than retaliate. To that end, officials from Mexico met with U.S. counterparts on Friday to establish a permanent working group that would allow the countries to consistently discuss key issues, including flashpoints like security, migration, water management and the economy, according to a press release Saturday.

During that meeting, the U.S. informed Mexico it would send a letter setting new tariffs on Aug. 1, according to the press release, which was issued jointly by Mexico's economy and foreign affairs ministries. Mexico's officials called the action unfair and said they did not agree, but established that one of the working group's first goals would be to seek an alternative prior to the implementation date, according to the release.

“It is highly relevant to have established, since July 11, the necessary channels and space to resolve any possibility of new tariffs going into effect on August 1,” the release says in Spanish. “In other words, Mexico is already in negotiations.”

Trump’s missive to EU President Ursula von der Leyen is also mostly identical to other versions he has shared this week but features a line not included in any previously posted version.

“The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large trade deficit,” the letter says. It is unclear if this is a provision to which the EU has agreed or a request from the president.

EU imports currently face a 10% baseline duty for entering the U.S. The bloc is one of many U.S. trading partners attempting to navigate Trump's tariff-heavy trade policy and negotiate with the White House for reduced duties.

“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic. We will continue working towards an agreement by August 1,” von der Leyen said in a post on X Saturday. “At the same time, we are ready to safeguard EU interests on the basis of proportionate countermeasures.”

In May, Trump said talks with the EU ""are going nowhere"" and recommended a 50% tariff on imports from the bloc starting July 9. The president has also threatened tariffs on specific EU-origin products — including wine and champagne — and levied duties targeting major sectors like steel, aluminum and the automotive industry.

Since February, the barrage of U.S.-imposed tariffs have impacted 70% of total EU trade with the U.S., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech Tuesday.

""The scale and the scope of these measures is unprecedented,"" von der Leyen said. ""Our line has been clear. We will be firm. We do prefer a negotiated solution. This is why we are working closely with the US administration to get an agreement.""

The EU has been preparing its own countermeasures if ongoing tariff negotiations fall short of the bloc's goals. The retaliatory actions would impact more than $100 billion worth of imports and apply to a range of industrial and agricultural products.

Key Highlights:

1. JPMorgan Chase: The bank is expected to report on its bond portfolio, which has seen significant unrealized losses due to the high interest rate environment. According to S&P Global, JPMorgan Chase holds $22.91 billion in unrealized losses on its held-to-maturity (HTM) securities as of March 31 [3].

5. American Express: The company reported a quarterly revenue of $18.93 billion and a net profit of $2.58 billion. Analysts from Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating, while Truist Financial's Brian Foran also issued a Buy rating [1].

Wednesday, July 16:

1. Bank of America: The bank is expected to report on its net interest income (NII) and revenue. Bank of America's NII was $13.7 billion in the second quarter, with optimistic guidance for the latter half of 2024 [2].

2. Goldman Sachs: The investment bank reported a 150% year-over-year increase in second-quarter profits, driven by strong performance in its global banking & markets and asset & wealth management divisions [2].

3. Morgan Stanley: The bank saw a 41% increase in second-quarter profits, with revenue climbing 12% [2].

Thursday, July 17:

1. Netflix: The company is expected to report on its subscriber growth and revenue. Analysts are closely watching for any changes in subscriber numbers and growth projections.

2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): The company is expected to report on its chip production and revenue. TSMC is a key player in the semiconductor industry, and its earnings report will provide insights into the global chip market.

2. Charles Schwab: The brokerage firm is expected to report on its client activity and revenue. Schwab's earnings report will provide insights into the retail brokerage market.

Market Implications:

The upcoming earnings reports will provide valuable information on the financial health of these companies. For instance, the bond portfolios of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America will be closely scrutinized for any signs of improvement or continued losses. Additionally, the NII and revenue reports from Bank of America will offer insights into the bank's consumer banking business. The strong performance of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley indicates a rebound in investment banking activity, which could have broader implications for the financial sector.

Investors should closely monitor these reports and analyze the companies' performance relative to their peers and market expectations. The earnings reports will likely influence market sentiment and could lead to significant price movements in the stocks of these companies.

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

The 30% tariffs were announced by US President Donald Trump in letters sent to the presidents of Mexico and the EU, which he posted on Truth Social July 12.

The EU and Mexico are the leading trade partners of the US.

The US is the EU's second-largest export market for steel, while Mexico leads exports of automotive products to the US.

In the letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said Mexico ""still has not stopped the cartels,"" and as a result, the US will start levying the tariffs. However, he added there will be no tariffs on Mexico if it builds or manufactures products in the US.

Similarly, Trump in his letter to EU President Ursula von der Leyen said the US had decided to end its trade deficit with the bloc and would go ahead with the tariffs, unless the EU decides to build or manufacture products in the US.

It was not clear if the current tariffs on Mexico would conflict with exemptions on trade of goods signed under the USMCA trade agreement.

Both letters mentioned that these tariffs are separate from the ""sectoral tariffs"" and any ""good transhipped to evade this higher tariff will be subjected to that higher tariff.""

In the week starting July 7, Trump sent letters to several countries imposing a varied range of tariffs on its key trade partners, including Canada, another key supplier of commodities such as steel, natural gas, and beef.

Metals sector uncertainty

From a metals perspective, the change in tariffs brings uncertainty to steel, aluminum and copper markets, as the US already has a separate 50% tariff on each of these commodities, considered critical for the economy and energy transition.

The 50% tariffs on steel imports and reciprocal tariff threats have led the US construction industry to postpone projects due to uncertainty about prices.

Since the start of 2025, Platts-assessed TSI US HRC EXW Indiana reached a year-to-date high of $950/st on March 12, the day when Trump announced the first round of tariffs. However, prices since those highs have fallen 8.4%, reaching $870/st July 11. Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The EU exported about 17% of its exportable finished steel products to the US in 2024, according to Comex data.

EU steel product exports remained steady in 2024 year over year, according to S&P Global Commodities at Sea data.

From an agricultural perspective, markets in Mexico will be watching for the next developments as the country is a key importer of US corn, pork, chicken and beef.

Mexico also supplies crude oil to the US, while the US is a major supplier of refined products to Mexico.

The US runs its highest trade deficit with Mexico, according to the US Census Bureau.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-13 12:11:08.545014
