And as it turns out, the retail juggernaut's scale and reach are proving to be tremendous assets in the AI race.

That's because most top AI companies — like OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, or Meta — operate in a primarily virtual space, processing unfathomably complex rivers of information into more digital information. AI-adjacent companies like Nvidia, Intel, and Oracle focus on providing the physical infrastructure upon which the AI machines function. Then there are the companies that are using digital intelligence to deliver physical results through automation and augmented experiences, like Tesla and Amazon.

Walmart, by contrast, has a vast and complicated set of physical challenges to solve as the largest retailer in the US — and the world. Those include everything from cleaning up spills in the dairy aisle to stocking shelves.

""We move billions of items around every month, every year,"" Walmart US CEO John Furner said Tuesday at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference. He said the company has been developing machine learning tools and other automation projects since around 2015.

Furner said that the company's AI models and supply chain automation help plan inventory to arrive at the right aisle at the right time, for example. One technique involves creating ""digital twins"" of each facility to model the movement of merchandise through the system on its way to customers.

Furner also said store associates increasingly have an AI chatbot handy via their handheld devices to help them better set priorities and help customers.

""It's a combination of people being powered by technology. There's a lot of judgment to retail and decision-making. And we're in a very dynamic industry,"" he said. ""We think this next phase of physical AI in combination with Gen AI is going to be really helpful.""

The company's head of e-commerce, David Guggina, told the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech conference last week how AI is helping his team run experiments and fulfill orders at an increasingly rapid rate.

Guggina said his team is now able to work at breathtaking speed behind the scenes, too.

""What took a data scientist days or weeks before can now be done in minutes,"" he said.

AI also helps ensure that each of the company's 4,700 stores has the kinds of products best suited to their local markets, slashing delivery times to minutes after a customer places an order.

""We've just completed the third inning,"" he said by way of the classic baseball game analogy. ""So we're still early with regard to our automation journey in the fulfillment network.""

These digital-to-physical uses of AI are also complemented by a myriad of ""micro agents"" that handle tasks like tracking local event calendars or monitoring inventory levels.

Walmart, of course, is still fine-tuning its AI approach, and there have been hiccups.

The proliferation of bespoke Walmart-made AI agents eventually started to confuse users, the company told the Wall Street Journal.

The company has rolled many of those micro agents into four ""super agents"" designed to assist shoppers, merchandisers, programmers, and third-party marketplace sellers.

Still, because Walmart's 20,000-strong global tech team builds so many of these digital and physical solutions in-house, the company is emerging as an unexpected AI powerhouse.

The company snagged former Instacart exec Daniel Danker in July to accelerate its AI efforts.

The analyst anticipates Tesla deliveries in the three months through the end of September to be around 465,000 units, above the consensus estimate of about 430,000 units.

Notably, in the third quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 462,890 vehicle deliveries. Tesla is experiencing a flow of positive data points, which will likely support the stock's recent strength, the analyst told investors in a research note, as per TheFly. The firm sees potential for the share strength to continue with a Q3 deliveries beat.

However, Barclays believes investors may also consider Tesla's weaker expected volume outlook for Q4 and beyond, especially in the U.S., where the firm predicts a significant decline in electric vehicle demand after the expiration of the EV tax credit on September 30.

Barclays keeps an ‘Equal Weight’ rating on Tesla with a $275 price target.

Separately, Tesla CEO Elon Musk acquired 2.57 million Tesla shares in multiple tranches on Friday, with the acquisition price ranging between $371 and $396.

A Stocktwits user opined that Musk's purchase of nearly $1 billion worth of Tesla shares was “down payment to get shareholders to approve his new pay package.” The Tesla board proposed a $1 trillion pay package for Musk over the next decade earlier this month. The proposed package will be put to shareholder approval in November.

Another user highlighted Tesla’s strong rally despite the pessimism.

Happy Labor Day Weekend! For me, this holiday brings a much-anticipated trip to the lake with loved ones—and I hope it brings rest and relaxation for you, too.

But before we clock out to enjoy the last few days of summer, let's reflect on the reason for the season. Labor Day recognizes workers' contributions to America's ""strength, prosperity and well-being,"" according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

In order to be strong, prosperous and well, we need health care workers—as reflected in the most recent data from the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA). The health care industry employed 17 million people in 2023, topping the charts as the largest employment sector in the U.S.

Still, it's no secret that the health care workforce is struggling. NCHWA predicts that by 2037, the country will be short 187,130 full-time equivalent physicians. In rural areas, the gap between supply and demand will be worse.

The greatest puzzle of the health care workforce shortage is that we can't just hire our way out of it. The U.S. population is rapidly aging and will require more services in the coming years than we're currently equipped to provide.

While there's no way to prevent the incoming crisis, there are some things that health systems can do to cushion the blow. And they're doing them. In the past several months, I've covered health care high schools that aim to start training the next generation early; a new medical school that is waiving tuition; virtual care initiatives that can extend the reach of a single physician across state lines; and AI tools that are working alongside (and in some cases, independent of) clinicians to lighten their load.

There is a lot to be hopeful about. But when I spoke to physicians about this topic in the spring, they pointed to a place where we could still do better.

Dr. Harry Severance, a member of the board of directors at Duke University School of Medicine's Collaborative Cardiovascular Society and Research Network and a member of the Tennessee Medical Association's wellbeing committee, told me that physicians will not remain in jobs where they do not feel respected. For many, the corporatization of the health care system has reduced their sense of agency. The current payer model has put checks and balances on hard-earned medical knowledge that many doctors find excessive. The administrative burden has contributed to record-high levels of burnout.

""You can recruit people in, but after a while—especially younger, more flexible people—they're going to turn around and leave,"" Severance told me. ""Why should they put up with all this abuse when they've got alternatives?""

I'll leave you with a quote from Dr. Laura Jett, a retired family medicine physician, who shared her reflections on the profession with me earlier this year.

""I've had time to think about what it means to be a doctor,"" Jett said. ""What is the service? What do we do with our lives? Nothing but work.

""It's a tremendous offering,"" she continued. ""It's devalued a lot. The mechanization or the industrialization of the medical practices, the delivery of health care, diminishes that sense of feeling like you're valued. ""

Major health care headlines from the week

Eighty-three percent of physician informatics officers have reported expanded responsibilities over the past two years, according to a new survey from WittKieffer—the largest of its kind. I spoke with the report's authors, CMIOs and CNIOs to understand how the role is shifting and what that means for health systems. Click here for the scoop.

The House Committee on Energy and Commerce plans to host a hearing on AI use and integration in the nation's health systems, examining how the new technology is improving care delivery for patients and providers. The event will take place on Wednesday, September 3 at 10:15 a.m. EST and will be livestreamed on the committee's website.

The American Medical Association (AMA) is pushing back against CMS' proposed Medicare physician payment rule for 2026, calling it ""flawed"" and ""faulty."" Specifically, the AMA raised concerns about CMS' proposed 2.5 percent cut to work relative-value units (RVUs) and physician intraservice time for most services, which would affect more than 95 percent of the services doctors provide,according to an analysis by the professional organization.The AMA also said that CMS' proposed reduction in practice-expense RVUs could drop overall physician payment by seven percent at certain facilities,including hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers.CMS is accepting comments on the proposed rule now through September 12. You can submit a public comment here (more than 4,400 comments had been received at the time of writing on Wednesday).

Workers at HCA Healthcare's Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center held an informational picket on Monday, alleging that the health care giant has allowed understaffing and turnover that perpetuates burnout amidst ""skyrocketing CEO compensation."" The Las Vegas hospital workers, represented by SEIU Local 1107, said ""the CEO made more in a single day than most workers made in an entire year."" HCA CEO Samuel Hagen made nearly $23.8 million in 2024, according to SEC filings reviewed by the Nevada Current.

Pulse Check

Executive perspectives on key industry issues

Merriam-Webster doesn't release their ""word of the year"" until December, but if I had to bet on one, it would be ""tariff.""

President Donald Trump and his administration have been clear about their goal to shift manufacturing to the United States from overseas, placing tariffs on other countries' exports and sparking negotiations with a handful.

It has been less clear, however, how these plans could impact the health care industry.

That's why I spoke with Jeff DiLullo, CEO of Philips North America, for this week's Pulse Check feature. Philips announced a $150 million investment in U.S. manufacturing, research and development this month: including the expansion of its Reedsville, Pennsylvania, manufacturing facility, which produces AI-enabled ultrasounds systems.

I asked DiLullo about the timing of this announcement, exploring how Trump's ""America First"" policies could impact U.S. health care systems. Below, find a portion of our conversation:

Editor's Note: Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

What is it about this moment that inspired the $150 million commitment to U.S. manufacturing, research and development? Why now?

I'll take you on a very quick journey. Number one, [during] the first Trump administration, we saw localization was needing to be more of a thing, right? It was just very clear. So we started things in motion way back then, eight or so years ago.

Now, if you can think back that far, the pandemic had a pretty sizable impact across the industry, our supply chain. You saw health care systems really struggling to get supplies, and so all of us sort of had this massive wake up moment that we needed to be much more local in our sourcing. That takes time in an FDA-cleared environment, so we've been working toward these things for years.

I do think the current administration, their focus on investment in the U.S., their desire to get manufacturing back here, makes it very easy to reduce some hurdles, to get back into a larger [U.S.-based] footprint that we want to have.

Why now? The U.S. health care market is growing. The cost of health care is growing at twice the pace of inflation. So that's not good, but this is a growing health care market, the most [rapidly] growing market in the world in terms of health care delivery as a percentage of per capita [spending]. So we absolutely want to be growing here. And we want to invest and make sure we have more agile, shorter supply chains, easier response to customers and the health systems we serve. That's why we're doubling down here.

You mentioned that the current administration has reduced some of those hurdles to expansion in the United States. What are those hurdles, specifically?

First of all, I want to applaud the administration and recognize what they're doing to try and reshape balance of trade. I think that has been a major point of the administration from day one, and we support that effort to do it. Practically speaking, this medtech business is largely a U.S. industry. About 70 percent of manufacturing, broadly speaking, across our industry, is done here in the U.S. About 90-plus percent of the research and development is in the U.S.

We're not quite that way [at Philips]. Our roots are in in the Netherlands, but we've continued to grow and invest and expand here in the U.S., as we've seen this as a market. So the industry itself, is very much an American industry, and I think we're already accomplishing many things the administration wants to do. We're doubling down where the growth is. Investment is key, and I think the more you can invest, the more likely it is to be able to grow your business here in what I would consider a reasonably-friendly regulatory environment, very specific on the FDA side of that regulation, I'm just talking in terms of the ability to move quickly.

For example, we wanted to get this facility up and running in six months. Nobody thought we could do it [because of] the bureaucracy at the state level and some of the construction. We sat and talked with our partners, Congressman Dr. John Joyce, Senator Dave McCormick, other local officials that were instrumental in helping us move the paperwork and [have] the ability to get all the approvals we need so that we can construct. We got it done in the time we said—actually under budget, under time—and now we have a new facility in Reedsville that's shipping U.S.-made product to the U.S. and across the globe. That's how we clear barriers. We partner with the folks that want to help us get rid of the non-value added work and helps us speed the production.

One of the concerns I've heard coming out of other industries as they look to move more manufacturing to the United States is that prices could go up as a result of the higher labor costs here. How are you managing costs at Philips and in the med tech industry, while operating largely in the U.S.?

That's partly true, if everything stays the same as what we're doing today. Although, for example, at Philips, we have a huge software and AI part of our business. About 50 percent of the code that's written today for Philips is written by AI. So we're actually deploying capabilities within our own organization to lower our cost structure, to be able to be more competitive.

That doesn't necessarily mean we're taking away American jobs, but we're putting jobs where people need to do the thought work. We're putting jobs where people do the physical manufacturing. And I think from our standpoint, we we're finding a way to absorb the impact of tariffs today. We're also finding very creative ways to automate our own processes and systems so that we're allowing people to focus on things they're best utilized to do. So bringing manufacturing back here is only part of the discussion. It's how else we're taking out cost in development and coding and other things that are allowing us to put resources where we want to grow up.

Our labor rate probably does go up. That's an isolated view of a business. And so we're kind of taking a much more holistic view of the total value. If I'm manufacturing here, and if I can get my product sooner and get it to my customers sooner and get it installed sooner, I'm going to get paid sooner. I actually have an incentive to move faster and deliver this capability to customers faster to allow me to offset some of that potential labor cost.

Why is it so important to have these capabilities in the United States as opposed to overseas?

There are always some things that impact the ability to deliver care. Cost is continuing to go up. The fact that I can actually start to build and deploy systems in days much closer to where my customers consume the technology—that is lifesaving in just about every case. I'm actually getting lifesaving capability in the hands of health care providers much sooner and ultimately at a lower cost, as I continue to develop more electronically or digitally capable tools. And the more I can deploy in some of these virtual or digital ways, or AI-enabled workflows, I'm actually allowing people to work wherever they're at. They can interact with radiology studies or diagnostics from their home, from their laptop.

I'm making the whole process much, much faster. I don't have to deal with privacy laws. Everything I do is embedded here in the United States. I don't have to deal with transatlantic privacy. I'm compliant here in the U.S. for all our cybersecurity requirements. It's faster, much more effective, to be able to get it into the market sooner, and completely compliant with laws and regulations that we don't have to satisfy outside of the U.S.

And the side note is, we're the most stringent regulatory environment in the world. So if we can do it right here, we can do it anywhere.

Executive Edge

How health care leaders are managing their own health

This week, I spoke with Suzen Heeley, executive director of design and construction at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She's the head designer on their new Kenneth C. Griffin Pavillion—a high-rise patient care tower that will soon be added to that famous Big Apple skyline.

Heeley described how the design of a space can influence human psychology, proactively contributing to (or detracting from) our sense of safety.

I'm cooking up a feature article on the Pavillion, which you can expect next month—but for now, here's a sneak peek at how Heely and her team are considering nurse wellbeing in their design:

Editor's Note: Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

""We're really trying to use research to develop the design as opposed to just making a beautiful space, and thinking about how it can impact not just the patients, but certainly the staff as well. We want to think about them and the pressures and the stress that they're under every day.

""One of the things we heard [from staff], which I thought was fascinating, was that there are periods where they want to be joyful. Somebody's getting engaged or having a baby or whatever, and they feel like they don't have a space where they can express their emotions in that way, because patients are maybe not in a place where they feel joy. We need to create those kind of off-stage spaces for staff to be in to express those emotions, whether they're joy or sorrow. You know, there's a lot of emotion that happens in these spaces on a day-to-day basis. So that was really kind of the foundation of the work that we were doing. We wanted to, of course, build that into our thinking and the way we were creating the design for the space.

""We have things like respite spaces, so places for them to have a private moment when they need it for emotional release, respite, refuge or renewal. And then we think about what those spaces could be, giving the staff the ability to control the temperature, lighting, sound if they want to play their music (or if they want to just sit and feel the quiet, they can do that). But these are spaces where staff can just step away. Unfortunately, on these nursing units, oftentimes they can't walk away too far because they're needed there. So we will have these respite spaces embedded in the patient units to take care of them and be there for them.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2722880/jeff-dilullo.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 15:11:44.911648

WMT is at the forefront, betting big on artificial intelligence. WMT is accelerating its push into artificial intelligence with the rollout of AI super agents that could redefine how the retail industry currently operates. CEO Douglas McMillon emphasized that artificial intelligence plays a vital role in enhancing both customer and employee experiences, with Walmart’s AI efforts built around four super agents designed to handle different aspects of the business.

Leading the charge is Sparky, the smiling digital assistant in Walmart’s app. Sparky is already shifting the experience from search-based navigation to AI-powered assistance and is set to become the primary tool for product discovery, reorders and returns. Early feedback has been positive, and Walmart plans to scale Sparky into a more intelligent and personalized companion for shoppers.

Complementing Sparky are three more super agents. Starting with the associate agent, which will consolidate key functions such as scheduling and sales data into one hub. For suppliers and advertisers, another agent will simplify onboarding, order management and campaign execution, enhancing efficiency across Walmart’s ecosystem. The final developer agent is designed to accelerate innovation by improving how Walmart tests and launches new products.

Walmart has created leadership roles focused solely on artificial intelligence. WMT is exploring AI-powered digital twins of facilities that can predict or prevent issues and provide more accurate delivery windows covering 95% of U.S. households by the end of the year. By embedding artificial intelligence, Walmart is signaling that the next era of retail will be shaped as much by intelligent agents as by physical stores.

Colgate-Palmolive Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Colgate-Palmolive, you need to believe in the ongoing resilience of its global brands across consumer health and pet nutrition, especially as the company steps up investment in productivity. The recent dividend announcement combined with a US$200 million to US$300 million productivity initiative does not substantially change the near-term catalyst around margin pressures from raw material costs, nor does it greatly mitigate the key risk of prolonged consumer caution in major markets.

Among all recent announcements, the board’s decision to maintain the quarterly cash dividend at US$0.52 per share stands out as especially relevant, reinforcing confidence in steady shareholder returns despite ongoing economic challenges. This consistency may continue to support investor sentiment as the company pursues its 2030 goals, though actual topline acceleration still hinges on category recovery and relief in raw material input costs.

However, it is important to remember that ongoing volatility in raw material and packaging expenses remains a risk investors should not ignore, especially when...

Colgate-Palmolive's outlook anticipates $22.4 billion in revenue and $3.5 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection is based on 3.8% annual revenue growth and a $0.6 billion increase in earnings from the current $2.9 billion level.

Keeping costs down for consumers is paramount as the grocery industry ramps up e-commerce, Instacart CEO Chris Rogers said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Wednesday.

“Affordability is probably the biggest unlock to online grocery adoption. We know that it’s the No. 1 reason that people churn off of Instacart,” Rogers said, noting that affordability will be a “key lever” in retaining more consumers.

To that end, Instacart is working with its retail partners on their pricing strategies as well as integrating retailers’ loyalty programs and offering weekly flyers, said Rogers, who became CEO in mid-August after nearly six years with the grocery technology company, including three as its chief business officer.

While retailers decide how to price on Instacart, the grocery technology company is urging them to price at or just above in-store prices, Rogers said, noting that retailers that offer price parity outperform those that mark up prices on the Instacart platform.

“We’re going to really show the business case to retailers and show them the compelling reasons why they should do this and also just make sure that we’re educating them on the broader digital landscape,” Rogers said.

During the past 12 months, sales among price-parity retailers have grown, on average, 10 percentage points faster than among marked-up retailers, he noted.

“We’re also seeing on our platform that users that are shopping on price-parity retailers are retaining better, so the data is suggesting that this is a strategic move for our retail partners,” he said.

Earlier this year, Instacart announced that Schnuck Markets, Heritage Grocers Group and home improvement chain Lowe’s switched to price parity. Walmart Canada lowered its markup, as did Costco on its same-day delivery websites for the U.S. and Canada.

Instacart is testing merchandising tools within its app that highlight price-parity retailers, Rogers added.

The company is also focused on continuing the momentum with its enterprise platform. Instacart sees the opportunity to expand its tools for retailers’ sites beyond North America, Rogers said. The company’s acquisition earlier this year of e-commerce solutions provider Wynshop “kind of exposed the fact that there is real product market fit for our enterprise suite of products beyond [North America],” he said.

The final priority Rogers outlined for the company is accelerating its ads and data revenue as well as ramping up monetization of data through its newly launched Consumer Insights Portal.

“I had a retailer recently tell me that the amount that I’m writing them a check for the ads business is larger than the SaaS fee that they’re paying us for the storefront,” Rogers said, referring to the acronym for Software as a Service.

Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Medtronic.

Simply Wall St performs a valuation analysis on every stock in the world every day (check out Medtronic's valuation analysis). We show the entire calculation in full. You can track the result in your watchlist or portfolio and be alerted when this changes.

Approach 2: Medtronic Price vs Earnings

For a consistently profitable company like Medtronic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used and meaningful valuation metrics. It helps investors assess how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of Medtronic's earnings, providing a snapshot of both value and growth expectations.

Growth prospects and business risks play a significant role in determining what a ""normal"" PE ratio should be. Companies with strong growth and stable earnings often command higher PE multiples because investors anticipate future profits. On the other hand, when risks are elevated or future growth appears limited, the fair PE typically decreases.

Medtronic currently trades at a PE ratio of 25.9x. For context, the average PE ratio among its medical equipment peers is 47.4x, while the broader industry average is 29.1x. This suggests Medtronic is being valued more conservatively than many of its peers.

Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio calculation provides a more nuanced view by considering Medtronic's specific growth rates, risk profile, profit margins, and market cap. This tailored approach avoids the limitations of simple peer comparison and takes into account factors unique to Medtronic rather than relying on broad industry averages. Based on these inputs, Medtronic’s Fair Ratio is 27.5x.

With an actual PE of 25.9x and a Fair Ratio of 27.5x, Medtronic's valuation aligns closely with expectations for a business of its quality, growth, and risk.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Medtronic Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. Put simply, a Narrative is your personal story about Medtronic, combining what you think about its future (like expected revenue, margin, and risks) with how those beliefs translate into a fair value for the stock.

With Narratives, you move beyond just tracking numbers. You actually link the company’s business story, such as why it will succeed or struggle, to concrete financial forecasts and arrive at a price you believe is justified. Narratives are easy to create and update right inside Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share and discuss their perspectives.

This approach is practical too: you can quickly compare your fair value with the market price to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell. Because Narratives update when fresh news or earnings arrive, your view stays relevant and informed. For example, some Medtronic Narratives currently see fair value as high as $112 if innovation and robotics outpace expectations, while others see value closer to $82 amid execution and margin concerns. This shows that what you believe about the business really can shape your investment choices.

People without smart glasses may one day be at a “significant cognitive disadvantage” compared to those who do use the tech, he told analysts.

That vision for the company’s future could come into focus this week during the Meta Connect conference, where the tech giant outlines its next steps and announces new products. Reports suggest Meta will announce a new pair of AI-powered smart glasses to follow its relatively successful Ray-Ban spectacles, which can analyze a wearer’s environment and answer questions about their surroundings.

The smart glasses have been a bright spot in Meta’s largely lackluster attempts to bet early on disruptive technologies. It missed out on the smartphone in the early 2000s. Then in 2021, the company tried to reorient its brand around the metaverse, which failed to reshape the internet in the way Zuckerberg had envisioned.

But Meta’s glasses appear to be catching on with consumers; Ray-Ban parent EssilorLuxottica said in July that revenue from its Meta glasses more than tripled year-over-year. And market research indicates Meta is the leading smart glasses brand by far.

Smart glasses aren’t likely to become as ubiquitous as smartphones anytime soon. But they could allow Meta to reach consumers directly, potentially reducing reliance on smartphones. That could be critical as Meta seeks to develop “personal superintelligence” — a vague term Zuckerberg has used to describe AI that “knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.”

The pressure is on as a wave of tech giants including Samsung, Google and Meta’s longtime social media rival Snap prepare to launch new smart glasses. Amazon is also developing new glasses with augmented reality, a technology that places computer graphics over real-world surroundings, according to The Information.

Meta’s AI glasses push

Meta and Ray-Ban partnered on a pair of glasses in 2021 called the Ray-Ban Stories that were primarily designed for capturing photos and videos hands-free. But Meta was far from the first to explore using glasses for tasks like snapping photos, making calls and listening to music without reaching for your phone.

Snap and Amazon, in addition to a wave of smaller tech firms, have all released smart glasses for these purposes. Google was an early entrant in 2013 with Google Glass, although that device was unpopular with consumers because of its high price, unfashionable look, limited functionality and short battery life.

Tech giants believe this new wave of smart glasses will be different. The technologies required to power the glasses – like processors, batteries and cameras – are now easier to fit in smaller, more lightweight designs at a much lower price than Google Glass.

But AI advancements have been primarily driving these new smart glasses. Virtual assistants that can answer questions based on a user’s surroundings nearly instantly have made smart glasses much more practical. With Meta’s eyewear, for example, a user can look at a pepper and ask whether it’s spicy, or read a sign and ask Meta’s AI assistant to translate it into a different language.

Meta is said to be developing new smart glasses that include a display for viewing apps and notifications and a wristband for easier gesture control, according to Bloomberg. Meta will likely announce these spectacles at the Connect conference, which it said will focus on the “latest innovations in AI glasses,” among other things. Last year, the company announced a prototype for its Orion augmented reality glasses.

Meta declined to comment on potential plans to announce new glasses at this week’s event.

The current Ray-Ban Meta glasses don’t display anything on the lenses, meaning wearers rely on audio feedback or Meta’s phone app. That could put them at a disadvantage compared to upcoming glasses like those from Google, which have a display for showing information along with providing verbal answers.

“That’s going to be another challenge,” said Guillaume Chansin, an analyst with market research firm Counterpoint Research. “Like if you want to replace a smartphone, can you really do that without having some kind of visual feedback?”

Why Meta cares so much about smart glasses

The AI boom has led to a tech industry frenzy to capitalize on the technology, as companies fear being perceived as behind the potential next big thing.

“Everybody is looking for what’s coming after the smartphone,” said Chansin.

The success of Apple’s AirPods and other wireless earbuds could strengthen the case for smart glasses. While the devices are inherently different, they serve some of the same purposes, like making calls and communicating with digital assistants without pulling out your phone.

“As we look forward, maybe smart glasses are going to evolve into the AirPods of the future,” said Melissa Otto, head of research at investment research provider S&P Global Visible Alpha.

Meta faces an uphill battle. While demand for smart glasses seems to be growing fast (ABI Research predicts the market will ship 13 million units in 2026, up from 3.3 million in 2024), they’re still a niche product. Hundreds of millions of smartphones are shipped in one quarter alone, and there’s little indication that smart glasses will ever be nearly as widely adopted.

Reality Labs, the division of Meta responsible for the company’s AI glasses and Quest virtual reality headsets, saw a $4.5 billion operating loss in the company’s fiscal second quarter of 2025. By comparison, Meta’s apps generated $583 million in revenue.

So what’s really in it for Meta? While smart glasses may not be a revenue driver right now, they could potentially set the stage for a future in which Meta is less reliant on hardware makers like Apple and Google to distribute its apps.

Meta has previously butted heads with Apple over policies related to the iPhone maker’s App Store, and Zuckerberg has previously criticized the iPhone maker’s App Store dominance.

“Apple’s (app store) stands out as the only one where one company can control what apps get on the device,” Zuckerberg said during the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit in 2022.

If glasses become the primary way people video chat and browse social media feeds, selling its own eyewear could give Meta more control over the experience.

“I look at Facebook, look at Instagram, look at Reels, Threads through my iPhone,” said Otto. “I don’t do it through a laptop. I don’t do it through smart glasses. I do it through my iPhone.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-09-25t204232z-1101917728-rc2u7aaqtwho-rtrmadp-3-meta-platforms-virtual-reality-zuckerberg.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-15 08:07:04.817467

Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) has dropped -6.58% in recent trading, painting a weak picture on the technical charts, and analysts suggest caution. With seven bearish indicators outweighing the single bullish one, the stock is under pressure, and our internal diagnostic score (0-10) for technicals stands at just 2.41.

News Highlights

Recent headlines in the food sector offer mixed signals for KHC:

DoorDash's aggressive consolidation in the food delivery market could reshape industry dynamics. DoorDash's $3.9 billion acquisition of Deliveroo highlights a growing trend of scale and tech-driven logistics—both of which could indirectly pressure traditional packaged goods players like .

Global food labeling reforms are gaining traction, with India and the US tightening standards for nutritional transparency. While this is a long-term trend, it may affect KHC's product positioning and marketing strategies, especially in emerging markets.

India's reliance on imported food processing machinery highlights potential vulnerabilities in global supply chains—KHC's exposure to international manufacturing could be a risk to monitor, especially with rising trade tensions and inflationary pressures.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Analyst sentiment for KHC remains neutral, with five recent ratings all at ""Neutral."" The simple average rating is 3.00, while the performance-weighted rating is 2.64. This slight divergence shows analysts are cautious but not entirely bearish, though their recommendations are not aligned with the current -6.58% price decline.

On the fundamental side, here are the key metrics and their internal diagnostic scores (0-10):

EV/EBIT: -3.53 (score 3.00) – A relatively bearish signal as the company's enterprise value is not well supported by its earnings.

Net income / Revenue: -7.93% (score 3.00) – Indicates a shrinking profit margin, which is a red flag for investors.

ROA: -0.96% (score 1.00) – A weak return on assets highlights concerns about asset utilization and profitability.

Rate of return on total assets: -7.86% (score 1.00) – Suggests the company is struggling to generate returns from its asset base.

Annualized return on total assets: -15.73% (score 1.00) – A severe underperformance in asset returns, worsening on an annualized basis.

While some factors are positive, like the Net profit attributable to parent company shareholders / Net profit: 100.04% (score 3.00), the overall score for fundamentals is 7.21, suggesting there is underlying strength, but it is not enough to offset the bearish technical and flow signals.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows suggest a nuanced picture for KHC. Big-money (institutional) flows are trending positive, with an inflow ratio of 50.75% and a positive block trend. In contrast, retail (small) flows are negative, with a 48.07% inflow ratio, indicating that retail investors are pulling back. Our internal diagnostic score for fund flows is 7.76 (good), showing a strong institutional presence but caution for smaller investors.

Key Technical Signals

The technical outlook for KHC is bleak, with seven bearish signals versus one bullish one. Here are the key internal diagnostic scores (0-10) for recent indicators:

Bullish Engulfing: 8.08 – A rare positive signal, but it was countered by more bearish patterns.

WR Overbought: 1.00 – Suggests the stock is in an overbought range, a precursor to a sell-off.

MACD Death Cross: 2.62 – A bearish momentum signal, suggesting the downward trend may persist.

Ex-Dividend Date: 1.00 – Historically weak, with a 25% win rate and average -3.03% returns in the past.

MACD Golden Cross: 1.00 – A typically bullish signal but here it scored poorly, indicating a bearish trap.

On September 28, the stock saw a Bearish Engulfing pattern, and on August 29, multiple signals—WR Overbought, MACD Golden Cross, Ex-Dividend Date, and Bullish Engulfing—appeared simultaneously, suggesting a volatile phase in the chart. The key takeaway is that the stock is in a weak technical state, and the bearish indicators heavily outnumber the bullish ones.

Meanwhile, Costco has begun strictly enforcing early shopping hours exclusively for Executive Members. Together, these moves highlight two very different approaches to driving value in membership models — one focused on added choice, the other on enforced exclusivity.

Walmart: Bundling Through Choice

Walmart announced that Walmart+ members will soon be able to select either the ad-supported Paramount+ Essential plan or Peacock Premium as part of their membership. Subscribers may switch between the two streaming services once every 90 days.

The new option marks Walmart+’s fifth anniversary and expands on a bundle that previously only offered Paramount+. Importantly, pricing remains unchanged at $12.95 per month or $98 per year.

The service continues to include other core benefits, such as free grocery delivery, free shipping with no minimum order, fuel discounts, and prescription savings. By adding flexibility without raising prices, Walmart is clearly aiming to boost engagement and retention.

Costco: Exclusivity Through Enforcement

Costco, by contrast, has taken a harder line. As of September 1, only Executive Members — who pay $130 annually versus $65 for Gold Star or Business memberships — can enter warehouses during early access hours. Gold Star and Business members are now restricted to regular opening times.

The rule was introduced earlier this summer but was loosely enforced during a grace period. September marked the beginning of strict enforcement at warehouse doors, with non-Executive members turned away if they attempt early entry.

Executive Members represent nearly half of Costco’s subscriber base but deliver a disproportionate share of sales, making enforcement a strategic push to strengthen tier economics and encourage upgrades.

Industry Context

The two announcements underscore diverging strategies in subscription and membership design:

Walmart+ is layering in additive value, expanding its bundle by giving all members access to more choice and flexibility.

Costco is enforcing exclusivity, drawing sharper lines between tiers and requiring staff intervention to uphold the policy.

Both approaches highlight how subscription and membership businesses are experimenting with levers of retention and monetization. Where Walmart is betting that flexibility deepens engagement, Costco is relying on exclusivity to push upgrades and reinforce premium tiers.

INSIDER TAKE

For subscription executives, these developments illustrate critical strategic contrasts:

Flexibility vs. Restriction: Walmart’s quarterly streaming switch is designed to feel empowering, while Costco’s early-access rule creates a clear sense of exclusion. Both approaches can drive results, but they trigger very different customer emotions.

Perceived Value vs. Perceived Penalty: Walmart enhances value without changing price, framing the perk as a reward. Costco introduces friction for lower-tier members, risking pushback but betting the exclusivity will drive upgrades.

Tier Management Lessons: Costco demonstrates the revenue potential of enforcing premium tiers — but also the reputational risk. Walmart shows how a flat membership can still grow stickier through partnerships and flexible benefits.

The Bundling Imperative: Walmart’s partnership with both Paramount+ and Peacock reflects a larger trend: cross-industry alliances are becoming table stakes in consumer membership models. For subscription leaders, the lesson is to evaluate not just what’s bundled, but how much flexibility customers have in consuming those bundles.

The takeaway: loyalty programs and memberships are evolving in two distinct directions — additive flexibility and enforced exclusivity. Both can work, but each carries very different risks and rewards.",https://www.subscriptioninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Walmart-2-1920-x-1670.png,N,,2025-09-14 17:06:14.292857

Bullish and bearish indicators are in a standoff, with a weak technical outlook and mixed price momentum.

(BSX) is currently down 2.64%, trading in a volatile pattern that suggests investors should be cautious and watch for clearer signals.

News Highlights

Recent news in the healthcare sector has been mixed, but here are a few key stories worth noting:

Healthcare Infrastructure Financing: Stanford Health Care announced a $424.9 million municipal bond sale to fund projects and refund debt. While this doesn’t directly affect , it shows continued investment in the healthcare infrastructure, which could bode well for long-term demand.

AI in Healthcare Billing: Healthpoint Ventures, a Tennessee-based startup, is using AI to streamline healthcare billing, partnering with regional providers like Williamson Health. Innovations like this could indirectly benefit medical device companies like Boston Scientific by boosting overall sector efficiency and growth.

Competitive Moves in Medical Devices: saw a price uptick after Boston Scientific announced the discontinuation of its rival heart-valve replacement systems. This kind of competitive shift can impact market sentiment and stock performance.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Analysts remain divided but leaning toward optimism, with a simple average rating of 4.50 and a performance-weighted rating of 5.62. However, this optimism contrasts with the current price drop, which shows the market's expectations are not fully aligned with near-term stock performance.

Fundamental Highlights

Price-to-Sales (PS) ratio: 28.90 (value: 28.89) with an internal diagnostic score of 1. High PS may signal overvaluation or strong revenue expectations.

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 15.71% (value: 0.1571) with a strong internal diagnostic score of 3. Healthy profitability remains a key strength.

Return on Assets (ROA): 1.91% (value: 0.0191) with a moderate internal diagnostic score of 2. Suggests decent but not exceptional asset utilization.

Return on Equity (ROE): 3.51% (value: 0.0351) with a moderate internal diagnostic score of 1. ROE is relatively low, indicating room for improvement in shareholder returns.

Cash flow from operations to assets (Cash-UP): 90.37% (value: 0.9037) with a strong internal diagnostic score of 3. Strong operational cash flow is a positive sign.

Money-Flow Trends

Big-money investors and institutional flows are showing a negative trend, with all sizes of inflows—small, medium, large, and extra-large—slightly below 50%. The fund-flow score of 7.59 (good) indicates that while large-scale investors are pulling back, the overall flow still shows some strength in retail and smaller institutional buying.

Key Technical Signals

The technical outlook for BSX remains weak and volatile, with more bearish indicators than bullish ones active in the last five days.

Internal Diagnostic Scores

Williams %R Overbought: internal diagnostic score of 3.2 — suggesting limited upside potential.

MACD Death Cross: internal diagnostic score of 2.2 — bearish momentum is gaining strength.

Bullish Engulfing: internal diagnostic score of 2.67 — typically a bullish candlestick pattern but currently leaning bearish.

Shooting Star: internal diagnostic score of 7.27 — a strong bearish reversal signal.

Hanging Man: internal diagnostic score of 7.17 — also a bearish top reversal pattern.

Recent Chart Patterns

2025-09-03: Hanging Man and WR Overbought signals suggest a potential top in the short term.

2025-09-09: A Shooting Star pattern appears — a red flag for bearish reversal.

2025-09-11: WR Oversold and MACD Death Cross signals suggest the stock is overextended and likely to correct.

Technical Summary

The overall technical score is 4.37, with 4 bearish and only 2 bullish indicators active in the last five days. The key insight is that the market is in a volatile state with no clear directional bias, and investors are advised to monitor market changes closely.

Headline Takeaway:

(ECL) is in a technical neutral zone, with no strong directional signal from recent indicators. The price has fallen by 1.60% recently, which contrasts with a relatively balanced analyst sentiment.

News Highlights

Recent news highlights include significant policy shifts in the U.S. regarding Covid-19 vaccines, the Trump administration’s push to fast-track uranium mining in Utah, and developments around Ethereum and

ETFs by REX Shares. These events reflect broader market uncertainty, especially around regulatory and policy changes, which may indirectly affect Ecolab’s operations in the industrial and healthcare sectors.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab has received a simple average analyst rating of 3.67 and a performance-weighted rating of 3.26. The ratings are relatively neutral to slightly positive, but there is notable dispersion in analyst views, with one ""Neutral"" and two ""Buy"" ratings over the past 20 days. This divergence doesn’t strongly align with the recent price drop of 1.60%, indicating mixed expectations among market participants.

Key fundamental factors include:

Price-to-Earnings (PE): 148.64 – Score: 0.00 (internal diagnostic score). High valuation relative to earnings.

Cost of sales ratio: 55.48% – Score: 1.00. Suggests moderate cost burden.

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities per Share YoY): -14.74% – Score: 2.00. Indicates a sharp decline in operating cash flow.

Fixed assets turnover ratio: 2.01 – Score: 1.00. Suggests efficient use of fixed assets.

Cash-UP (Cash to Market Value): 0.65 – Score: 3.00. Indicates a moderate liquidity position.

Money-Flow Trends

Big-money and retail flow patterns for Ecolab show a negative overall trend, with all major investor categories (Large, Extra-large,

.) showing outflows. The overall inflow ratio is 47.43%, which suggests that even within the negative trend, some inflows are happening, but not enough to reverse the pattern. This could indicate cautious positioning by institutional players and retreating confidence from smaller investors.

Key Technical Signals

From a technical perspective, Ecolab’s chart shows no bullish signals, but one bearish signal and one neutral signal. The most recent indicators include:

WR Oversold – Internal diagnostic score: 3.71 (neutral rise, 53.66% win rate, avg. return: 0.33%).

Bearish Engulfing – Internal diagnostic score: 6.56 (neutral rise, 62.5% win rate, avg. return: 0.84%).

Recent chart patterns over the last 5 days show multiple instances of WR Oversold (on 9/10, 9/03, 9/02, 9/09) and one Bearish Engulfing on 9/05. These suggest that while the market is not decisively bearish, volatility and lack of direction are key features of the current technical landscape. The overall trend is neutral, and traders are advised to wait for a clearer signal before committing to a position.

Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point Corteva's potential split represents more than a corporate restructuring—it is a recalibration of risk and growth in an industry at a crossroads.","Corporate restructuring has long served as a catalyst for unlocking value in capital-intensive industries, and agribusiness is no exception.

Agriscience, the $50-billion agribusiness giant formed from the 2019 merger of Dow and DuPont's agricultural divisions, is reportedly exploring a strategic split of its seed and pesticide operations into two distinct entities Report: Corteva Agriscience is Looking to Breakup Its Seed[ 5 ]. This move, if executed, would align with broader industry trends toward specialization, ESG compliance, and liability mitigation while addressing investor demands for clarity in an increasingly fragmented market.

Industry Trends: Specialization and ESG-Driven Restructuring

The agribusiness sector has seen a surge in corporate restructurings in 2025, driven by the need to address climate risks, regulatory pressures, and evolving investor expectations. Companies like

and have similarly pursued spin-offs or divestitures to streamline operations and focus on core competencies . For Corteva, separating its seed and pesticide businesses could insulate its high-growth seed division from potential liabilities tied to crop protection products, a strategy mirrored by Bayer AG's earlier restructuring efforts Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ].

This shift reflects a broader industry pivot toward specialization. Precision agriculture, biotechnology, and sustainable practices are redefining competitive advantages, with investors increasingly favoring companies that demonstrate clear ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) progress. Corteva's 2024 Impact Report underscores this trend, highlighting innovations such as drought-resistant seeds and biocontrol agents that align with global sustainability goals Report: Corteva Agriscience is Looking to Breakup Its Seed[ 5 ]. By isolating its seed business, Corteva could amplify its ESG narrative, a critical factor in attracting capital amid heightened scrutiny of agricultural chemical footprints.

Financial Implications: Sharper Focus, Enhanced Returns

Corteva's financial framework through 2027 emphasizes cost reductions, productivity gains, and $4.5 billion in shareholder returns Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. A split could accelerate these objectives by allowing each business unit to optimize capital allocation. For instance, the seed division—responsible for $9.5 billion of Corteva's 2024 sales—might reinvest more aggressively in gene editing and biologicals, while the pesticide unit could prioritize compliance with tightening regulations on chemical usage.

Historical case studies reinforce this logic. Bayer's separation of its crop science division in 2018, though later merged again, initially boosted investor confidence by clarifying operational risks and growth prospects Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. Similarly, Corteva's proposed split could create two distinct investment vehicles: a pure-play seed company with recurring revenue streams and a crop protection firm focused on innovation in low-impact solutions. This duality may appeal to a broader range of investors, from those prioritizing long-term agricultural resilience to those seeking short-term gains in high-margin chemical markets.

ESG Compliance: A Dual-Track Strategy for Sustainability

Environmental liabilities have become a defining challenge for agribusinesses. Corteva's pesticide division, while profitable, faces mounting pressure from regulators and advocacy groups over the ecological impacts of synthetic chemicals. By decoupling this unit, the company could redirect resources toward its seed business, which is central to addressing food security and climate adaptation.

The split also aligns with Corteva's 2027 ESG targets, including $1 billion in cost savings from sustainable practices Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. For example, its advancements in bee vectoring technology and biofertilizers—highlighted in the 2024 Investor Day presentation—position the seed division as a leader in regenerative agriculture Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the pesticide unit could adopt stricter compliance protocols, such as those seen in Bayer's recent herbicide innovations, to mitigate reputational risks Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. This dual-track approach ensures both units contribute to ESG goals without diluting their core missions.

Investor Confidence: Balancing Risk and Reward

Investor sentiment toward agribusiness has grown more nuanced in recent years. While commodity prices and weather volatility remain concerns, stakeholders now prioritize companies that demonstrate adaptability to systemic risks. Corteva's proposed split addresses this by reducing ambiguity around liability exposure—a critical factor in a sector where litigation over chemical safety has cost firms billions.

Data from Corteva's 2024 financials reveals a 40% revenue split between seeds ($9.5 billion) and pesticides ($7.4 billion) . A separation would allow each unit to be valued independently, potentially unlocking hidden equity value. For instance, the seed business's recurring revenue model and R&D pipeline in gene editing could command a premium valuation, while the pesticide unit's focus on compliance-driven innovation might attract investors seeking stable cash flows in a regulated environment.

Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point

Corteva's potential split represents more than a corporate restructuring—it is a recalibration of risk and growth in an industry at a crossroads. By aligning with ESG imperatives, embracing specialization, and addressing liability concerns, the company could position itself as a leader in the next phase of agribusiness evolution. For investors, the move offers a clearer lens to assess value creation in two distinct but complementary markets. As the agribusiness sector navigates the dual pressures of climate change and technological disruption, Corteva's decision may well set a precedent for how legacy firms adapt to secure long-term relevance.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757739219976.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-13 21:02:40.669310

Separating its crop-seed unit from its pesticide business could help shield its seeds from any potential future liabilities associated with its pest and weed-killing chemicals, the report said, adding that the company is expected to reveal plans soon, barring any last-minute snags.

Corteva, spun off from chemical conglomerate DowDuPont in 2019, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Shares of the company rose 1.6 per cent in extended trading and it had a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion (C$69.2 billion) as of Friday.

Dive Brief:

Kroger will fuel modernization with AI as it deploys use cases to operate more efficiently, improve customer experience and boost sales, executives said during the grocer’s Q2 2025 earnings call Thursday.

“Accelerating our AI efforts is a natural step for Kroger, given our long history of leadership in data and machine learning,” Chairman and interim CEO Ron Sargent said Thursday. “Where we’ve implemented AI in different parts of the organization, we’re seeing results with more competitive pricing, shrink improvements and faster fulfillment.”

Cost optimization and operational efficiencies are top priorities for the grocer as it looks to move forward from its failed merger with Albertsons. Same-store sales excluding fuel rose 3.4%during the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of increase for this metric. The company also raised its identical sales growth forecast for the 2025 fiscal year.

Dive Insight:

Grocers, like other retailers, have increased their appetite for emerging technologies as leaders look to alleviate the effects of economic headwinds and add a competitive edge.

In April, Albertsons executives said the company was strengthening its data capabilities in pursuit of AI adoption. Walmart and Instacart have also worked to scale AI capabilities.

Kroger credits its “couple decades worth” of loyalty program data, a “deep bench of data science capability” and its 84.51° division for laying the foundation for its AI efforts, EVP and CFO David Kennerley said during the call Thursday.

Despite the focus on modernization, Kroger has reduced staff in related departments. In August, workers in Kroger’s Technology and Digital division were impacted. The company also laid off employees in 84.51°, the grocer’s retail analytics subsidiary, in March. The reduction in staff was an effort to “focus on the key priorities that power our go-to-market strategy,” a spokesperson told Grocery Dive.

Looking forward, Kroger plans to examine “all aspects” of its business to drive efficiencies, including a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfillment network, Sargent said during the latest earnings call.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/DPPUFEmJwyzXrW2tAT8kv6PfEIptANymLaTNFlzmgCo/g:nowe:0:0/c:2027:1145/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMzQ0My5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-12 16:09:19.858098

Zacks Investment Research","Colgate-Palmolive Company’s CL newly announced productivity program reflects its commitment to building a “future-fit” organization as part of its 2030 strategic plan. Even amid a challenging operating environment characterized by high raw material and packaging costs, tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty, Colgate has continued to deliver solid growth in net sales, organic sales and earnings per share. The program targets $300–$400 million in incremental savings by 2025, designed to complement ongoing revenue growth management (RGM) and funding-the-growth initiatives, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently while maintaining focus on long-term brand and category development.

The core strategy of the productivity program revolves around cost-saving and efficiency initiatives that strengthen Colgate’s operational foundation. These include optimizing the global supply chain for greater agility and resilience, leveraging AI and data analytics to enhance portfolio and promotional decisions, and prioritizing investments in high-return areas. By streamlining processes, improving pricing and mix strategies, and reducing overhead, Colgate aims to generate incremental savings that can either be reinvested in innovation and brand-building or applied directly to the bottom line. The program also emphasizes strategic use of price pack architecture, such as multipacks and smaller sizes, to meet evolving consumer needs while enhancing profitability.

Colgate’s productivity initiative is expected to drive long-term growth and efficiency by enabling it to navigate volatile markets while sustaining organic sales momentum. By combining cost discipline with strategic investment in core innovation, AI-driven RGM and digital capabilities, Colgate can enhance household penetration, maintain brand health and support consistent compounded earnings per share growth. If executed effectively, this program positions Colgate not only to weather near-term challenges but also to strengthen its competitive advantage and long-term profitability.

GIS is likely to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Sept. 17.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 81 cents per share, indicating a decrease of 24.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average.

The consensus estimate for General Mills’ quarterly revenues is pegged at $4.50 billion, which indicates a 7.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter.

Things to Know About GIS’ Q1 Earnings

General Mills operates in a highly competitive and price-sensitive food industry, where grocery inflation is weighing heavily on consumer spending. Reduced discretionary food spending by budget-conscious consumers remains a major obstacle to volume recovery. The company is also grappling with macroeconomic and operational headwinds across international markets, especially in China, where consumer demand remains subdued.

Additionally, sluggish trends in the U.S. snacking categories and softer demand in the away-from-home foodservice channel have further added to the company’s challenges. Persistence of such trends remains a concern for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We expect price/mix to drop 1.8% and volume to decline 1.2% in the fiscal first quarter.

However, General Mills is leveraging brand strength, innovation, cost savings and portfolio reshaping to enhance market share. The company has unveiled a multi-year global transformation initiative, part of its Accelerate strategy, to fuel growth. While General Mills has implemented cost-saving initiatives under its Holistic Margin Management strategy, persistent inflationary pressures continue to impact its performance. These broad-based cost challenges, combined with weakening consumer demand and tariff woes, underscore the tough landscape facing General Mills in the near term.

Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE: BDX) is a heavyweight in the global medical technology game. The business is split into three key segments: BD Medical (think syringes, needles, and devices that keep hospitals humming), BD Life Sciences (diagnostics and biosciences kits), and BD Interventional (surgical and critical care gadgets). BD gets its products into the hands of hospitals, clinical labs, pharma companies, and more, using a mix of direct sales teams in big markets and distributors everywhere else. Revenue comes from items you buy often (like disposable needles), big-ticket machines (such as infusion pumps and diagnostic analyzers), and extra services (analytics, consulting). The medtech and diagnostics space is built on steady demand from aging populations, rising chronic illness, and constant innovation. BD’s main rivals include Medtronic, Abbott, Baxter, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Stryker, and Edwards Lifesciences. Thanks to its diverse lineup and global reach, BD has a solid competitive moat—recurring sales, close ties with customers, and enough scale to hold onto pricing power in a lot of product lines.

Recent Performance

From September 2024 to September 11, 2025, BD's shares fell by 17.89%, while the S&P 500 rose 14.92%. This slump mainly comes down to shrinking valuation multiples and worries about near-term growth, especially in BD’s Life Sciences unit (with rumors of a possible divestiture swirling around). Tech stocks and growth names have been in vogue, widening the gap even further.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

BD’s revenue isn’t exactly sprinting—it’s grown a modest 4.8% over the past year, lagging behind the broader market’s 8.7%. The Medical segment is the bright spot, riding a rebound in elective procedures, with third quarter sales up 5.1% year-over-year. BD’s poised to boost its intensive care unit presence with the $900 million-a-year Critical Care business from Edwards Lifesciences (deal expected to close by end-2024). Meanwhile, BD’s looking to offload its $21 billion biosciences and diagnostics business—a move that could free up capital for faster-growing areas, with a deal targeted for late 2025.

Quality & Moat

BD’s operating margin stands at 11.3%—a bit higher than its five-year average (10.5%) but trailing the market’s 18.2%. Returns are modest: return on invested capital (ROIC) is 4.8%, just above BD’s past five-year average but well below the market’s 11.1%. The consumables franchise keeps recurring cash flowing, but free cash flow yield has dipped to –4.1% (historic average is +1.4%), mainly due to inventory build-up and working capital needs. CEO Tom Polen has kept a tight rein, returning around $1.1 billion through dividends and $0.5 billion via buybacks in 2024, while still investing in research and strategic deals.

Valuation

BD trades at a forward P/E of 31.1×—a premium over the market’s 26.0×—thanks to its defensive business model and reliable cash flow, though there’s not much room for near-term upside. The EV/Sales ratio is 3.2×, below both BD’s five-year average (4.1×) and the market’s (4.6×), hinting at some valuation cushion if growth picks up. The high earnings multiple is partly justified by BD’s low beta (0.55) and steady revenues, but negative free cash flow puts a question mark on margins and capital efficiency.

Market Sentiment

Analyst opinion is split: most stick to ‘Hold,’ with average price targets about 5% above the current share price. Short interest is tame at 2% of float, so there’s not much bearish betting. Big institutions own around 85% of the shares, and insider buying has been quiet. News about the potential Life Sciences divestiture has kept the stock in check, though if management executes cleanly, investors see the move as adding value.

Key Risks

High leverage and working capital strain: BDX’s net debt sits at 3.8× EBITDA—much higher than the market average of 1.4×. That eats into financial flexibility and ups the refinancing risk if interest rates stay high.

Moderate profitability metrics: ROIC of 4.8% and operating margins of about 11.3% don’t stack up well next to medtech peers (averaging around 18%), so free cash flow will probably stay muted until margins improve.

Execution risk on divestitures: Spinning off the Life Sciences business won’t be easy. Tax-friendly structures like a reverse Morris trust could complicate things, dragging out timelines and drawing management’s eye from the core business.

Competitive pressures and pricing: Fierce competition from heavyweights like Medtronic, Abbott, Thermo Fisher—and upstarts too—could put pressure on prices for BD’s bread-and-butter products.

Regulatory and litigation exposure: BD is in a tightly regulated industry. Product recalls, legal battles, or new healthcare rules could inflate costs and ding the company’s reputation.

Bull Case

Defensive, recurring revenue base: A big chunk of sales comes from consumables and disposables—which keeps cash coming in, even when the economy wobbles.

Strategic M&A and portfolio optimization: Adding Edwards’ Critical Care business should strengthen growth. Shedding slower-growing assets could unlock value and sharpen BD’s focus on its core medtech strengths.

Operational improvement initiatives: Management’s ‘grow, simplify, empower’ strategy is underway, aiming to fatten up margins by streamlining manufacturing and tightening up the supply chain.

Shareholder returns: BD keeps shareholders sweet with dividends and buybacks. If it pockets extra cash from asset sales, expect more buybacks.

Valuation support: With the EV/Sales ratio below its own history and the broader market average, there’s a potential cushion if growth stabilizes.

Bear Case

Valuation premium: A forward P/E of 31× is steep — even if EV/Sales looks cheap by comparison. Unless the multiple expands, there’s a ceiling on upside.

Negative free cash flow: Building up working capital and snapping up new businesses has pushed cash flow into the red, raising doubts about how sustainable BD’s cash generation really is.

Execution risks on divestitures: If spinning off the Life Sciences unit drags on or gets muddled, BD could stay stuck in the slow lane with too much complexity.

Margin pressure: Underwhelming profits from diagnostics and biosciences may need a restructuring—and that could mean spending cuts that crimp future growth.

High debt burden: At roughly 4× EBITDA, BD’s leverage magnifies risks from higher interest rates and ties its hands on new investments.

On Our Radar

Q4 FY 2025 earnings release: Expected in late November 2025. Investors will be keen to see how organic growth and margin guidance are shaping up during BD’s ongoing portfolio shakeup.

Life Sciences divestiture decision: Due by the end of 2025. How BD chooses to spin off, sell, or structure its Life Sciences business will play a huge role in shaping capital allocation and valuation.

Waters Corporation merger close: Watch for the sale of BD’s biosciences division to Waters for $17.5 billion—expected by the first quarter of 2026. Keep an eye on deal progress and how the proceeds get used.

FDA approvals for new devices: Clearances for new infusion pumps and diagnostics, expected late in 2025, could give BD some extra sales momentum.

Investment Conclusion

BDX stands out as a defensive medtech player, anchored by steady consumables revenue and a history of disciplined capital returns. But growth has cooled off, and the balance sheet carries a heavy load—negative free cash flow and profitability that trails the peer group. Long-term investors might see potential for value if management nails its next round of acquisitions in critical care and successfully sheds slower-growing assets. Near-term, though, there’s no escaping the risks tied to portfolio moves and premium price tags. Patient, risk-aware investors might want to wait for a clearer path—possibly accumulating shares on dips, once BD’s portfolio puzzle pieces have locked into place, balancing the company’s steady income stream against its debt and slimmer margins.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-12 12:26:18.613126

Takeaway:

(ECL) shows signs of technical neutrality with a wait-and-see stance, and recent price action has fallen by -4.03%. While bullish and bearish indicators are nearly balanced, investors are advised to monitor market changes closely.

News Highlights

Recent global and economic developments could influence Ecolab’s performance. Here are a few highlights:

U.S. vaccine policy changes are expected to impact public health and healthcare sectors. While not directly related to Ecolab, these shifts may influence overall market sentiment.

Trump’s fast-tracking of a Utah uranium mine signals a potential shift in energy policy and resource development, which may indirectly affect Ecolab’s industrial and environmental clients.

China’s factory activity contracted in May, but signs of recovery are emerging. A slowdown in global manufacturing could affect Ecolab’s international business operations.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab’s recent analyst ratings are mixed, with three institutions offering differing perspectives:

Simple average rating: 3.67 (indicating a cautiously bullish bias)

Performance-weighted rating: 3.26 (showing analysts with stronger historical performance have slightly more bearish expectations)

Rating consistency: Analysts are not aligned—two “Buy” ratings and one “Neutral” rating are currently active.

This mixed analyst sentiment contrasts with the recent 4.03% price decline, suggesting a misalignment between market expectations and current price movements.

Key fundamental values and scores:

Return on Assets (ROA): 2.23% (internal diagnostic score: 3.0)

Cash flow from operations (CFOA): 2.96% (score: 3.0)

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 31.89% (score: 2.0)

Current assets turnover ratio: 1.18x (score: 3.0)

Non-current liabilities / Total liabilities: 65.88% (score: 2.0)

Ecolab’s fundamentals are mixed, with stronger performance in operating cash flow and turnover, but moderate profitability and heavy long-term liabilities.

Money-Flow Trends

Ecolab has experienced negative fund-flow trends across all investor categories, with retail investors (small) contributing the least inflow at 48.57% and large and extra-large investors contributing 47.46% and 46.25% respectively. The overall inflow ratio stands at 46.91%, suggesting a cautious stance among big players. The negative trend in all categories reinforces the idea that investors are taking a wait-and-see approach, especially with mixed technical and fundamental signals.

Key Technical Signals

Technical analysis reveals a complex and neutral setup for Ecolab:

WR Oversold: Shows an internal diagnostic score of 3.94—a moderate strength signal with a 55.0% win rate and an average return of 0.38% over historical signals.

Bearish Engulfing: This pattern shows a stronger bullish bias with a 7.82 score—a 71.43% win rate and an average return of 1.17% when activated.

Looking at recent patterns, the Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern was activated on 2025-09-05, alongside a recurring WR Oversold signal. These signals have appeared frequently in the past five days, indicating a volatile but indecisive market.

Key insight: Technical indicators are showing a balanced mix of long and short signals, with no clear trend emerging. Investors are advised to monitor developments closely and be ready for sudden swings.

Companies (EL) has embarked on a bold transformation under its newly appointed leadership team, with innovation at the core of its ""Beauty Reimagined"" strategy. This strategic pivot, introduced in February 2025, aims to restore sustainable sales growth and rebuild stakeholder confidence after years of declining performance. For investors, the question is whether this leadership evolution—marked by a focus on disruptive technologies, agile execution, and consumer-centric innovation—can translate into long-term shareholder value.

Leadership Realignment: A Foundation for Change

The appointment of Stéphane de La Faverie as CEO in January 2025 signaled a decisive shift in EL's corporate direction. De La Faverie, a veteran of LVMH and L'Oréal, brings a track record of scaling luxury beauty brands. His leadership has been paired with the hiring of René Lammers, Ph.D., as Executive Vice President and Chief Research & Innovation Officer, a role critical to advancing EL's innovation agendaRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ]. Lammers' expertise in science-based platforms and global R&D partnerships aligns with the company's goal of accelerating product development cycles and capturing emerging trendsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ].

This leadership realignment has already yielded tangible results. For fiscal 2025, equity awards tied to performance metrics were earned at 70.1% of the target, reflecting progress toward strategic goals despite a challenging operating environment[PRE 14A] The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Preliminary Proxy Statement[ 2 ]. While this fell short of the initial 100% target, it underscores the performance-based nature of leadership incentives and the company's commitment to accountability.

Innovation-Driven Growth: From Lab to Market

EL's innovation strategy under ""Beauty Reimagined"" is not just about product launches—it's about redefining the beauty industry's relationship with consumers. In fiscal 2025, the company rolled out breakthrough products such as La Mer's Night Recovery Concentrate and the M·A·C Nudes Collection, both designed to address evolving consumer preferences for personalized, science-backed solutionsThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ]. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to expand ""consumer coverage"" through digital platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon's U.S. and Canadian Premium Beauty storesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ].

is prioritizing long-term innovation over short-term profitability—a risky but potentially rewarding bet.

Strategic Risks and Rewards

The path to restoring growth is fraught with challenges. EL's fiscal 2025 results highlight the difficulty of competing in a saturated beauty market, where consumer spending remains fragmented across categories. Yet the company's focus on ""disruptive technologies"" and collaborations with academic institutionsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ] suggests a willingness to invest in high-impact R&D. This approach mirrors successful models in tech and pharma, where breakthrough innovation drives decades of value.

A critical test will be the execution of ""Beauty Reimagined"" in fiscal 2026. The company has signaled optimism about returning to positive sales growth after three years of declinesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ], but this will require not only compelling products but also disciplined cost management.

The Bottom Line for Investors

For long-term investors, Estee Lauder's leadership evolution presents a compelling case study in balancing innovation with accountability. While fiscal 2025 results were lackluster, the company's strategic pivot—led by a seasoned CEO and a visionary R&D leader—positions it to capitalize on the $500 billion global beauty market's next wave of disruption. The success of this strategy will hinge on two factors: the ability to translate lab innovations into commercial hits and the discipline to avoid the operational missteps that have plagued the company in recent years.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757637947360.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-12 02:01:33.042858

However, this breakneck expansion is creating significant challenges, including a pervasive trust deficit, rising operational costs, and critical governance gaps that organizations are struggling to address.

“As organizations scale Agentic AI, they need to focus on priorities that deliver meaningful value with non-regrettable risk. This requires a unified enterprise framework that ensures consistent standards for ethics, access, orchestration, and observability,” said Craig Suckling, Chief AI Officer of Capgemini Europe.

Generative AI adoption reaches global scale

Generative AI has transitioned from experimental pilots to core business operations at a remarkable pace. Adoption has surged from a mere 6% of organizations in 2023 to 30% in 2025, representing a fivefold increase in just two years.

Currently, a significant percentage, which is 93% of companies, are actively investigating, experimenting with, or deploying GenAI capabilities in their operations. Industries such as telecommunications, consumer goods, and aerospace and defense are leaders in customer operations, marketing, and IT.

This is being driven by substantial and increasing investment, and most organizations report tangible benefits. Eighty-eight percent of organizations are spending more on GenAI, on average, 9% more investments in the last year, with 12% of the total IT budget allocated to the technology.

The returns are also evident, with 79% of organizations expressing satisfaction with their Gen AI results, citing increased innovation and productivity benefits.

Trust and governance gaps threaten AI scaling

Despite rapid adoption, a significant trust barrier prevents the full-scale deployment of autonomous AI systems.

Only 71% of organizations claim to be able to trust autonomous AI agents to be used in the enterprise to the full extent. It is due to security worries of 65%, the risk of privacy of 62%, and the threat of biased results of 51% that this skepticism is based on the deeper fear of relinquishing control without any verifiable assurances.

The lack of trust is complicated by a general inability to introduce efficient governance structures. Although almost half, which is 46% of organizations, have developed AI governance policies, nearly half of them, which is 47% are concerned that their employees rarely adhere to them.

Furthermore, governance is inconsistently applied across business functions in 47% of organizations, and dedicated oversight bodies, like a Chief AI Officer or an ethics committee, are found in only a minority of firms, leaving AI systems without adequate guardrails or accountability.

This project lays the foundation for further growth throughout Asia, which could prove to be a significant long-term growth engine and revenue diversification opportunity for Chipotle.

Chipotle’s Footprint Expansion Initiatives

Chipotle continues to execute on its long-term growth strategy by delivering exceptional food and hospitality as well as minimizing its expenses. It remains committed to improving the guest experience, emphasizing value and strengthening brand relevance in a challenging consumer environment. Looking ahead, the company plans to further highlight its value proposition by introducing new menu innovations, expanding its loyalty program and rolling out targeted marketing campaigns.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Chipotle advanced its expansion strategy by opening 61 new restaurants across the United States and Canada, including 47 Chipotlanes, and reaffirmed its target of 315 to 345 new openings for the year. The company is also deepening its international presence through strategic partnerships. In Mexico, Chipotle is collaborating with Alsea, a leading restaurant operator in Latin America and Europe, with the debut location expected to open in early 2026. In the Middle East, its partnership with Alshaya Group is set to accelerate development in the back half of 2025. Together, these initiatives provide a gateway into high-potential growth markets and strengthen Chipotle’s ability to extend its brand globally.

Shares of CMG have declined 22.7% in the past six months against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 12.7% rise. Also, weakening consumer confidence, tariff pressures and high expenses are a concern. Going forward, Chipotle intends to leverage digital programs to expand access and customer convenience.

So maybe it should not have been a surprise that just over two weeks after she wore a black-and-white striped Ralph Lauren sundress for her flower-festooned engagement shoot — one that sold out almost immediately — Ralph Lauren himself opened New York Fashion Week with a collection almost entirely black and white. And red.

After more than 50 years in business, he understands how to up the ante. And so he did, with volume and celebrities and some very, very wide-brimmed straw hats.

The show was held in the Lauren headquarters on Madison Avenue, in a room transformed for the day into a summery lounge with cushioned white couches, black wicker chandeliers and a curvy staircase at one end. The intimacy of the site only served to highlight the big picture view.

Nick Jonas sat with a hand on his wife Priyanka Chopra’s knee, each in matching shades of Ralph Lauren brown. Mindy Kaling, in a bronze suit, Naomi Watts, in a frilly shell, and Jessica Chastain, in black lace, whispered into one another’s ears and giggled. At the last minute, Oprah made her entrance with Gayle King. And all of them applauded the acres of material in Mr. Lauren’s generous trousers, sweeping skirts and halter tent gowns.

The palette may have been limited, but there was nothing constricting about the clothes — a relief at a time when the corset has been making a comeback, body-con is a trend and skinny trousers abound. There was even a very fancy pair of satiny white overalls, worn over a crystal-bedecked white tank, in case someone wanted to go straight from the garden to the gala.

Rather than looking blousey, or even bombastic, the effect was easy. Especially because all the swishiness at the bottom was balanced by bandeau tops, neatly tailored jackets and the occasional pair of shorts. Also, statement silver jewelry in organic shapes and some floppy bows.

These were pared-down pieces for someone who believes that harmony can be found in oppositions and is confident enough not to try too hard. That’s the essence of sportswear, which is itself part of the essence of American fashion, and Mr. Lauren understands it as well as anyone.

In any case, if Mr. Lauren was channeling a growth mind-set, it made sense. The only thing bigger than his pants and hats was his last few weeks, between Ms. Swift’s surprise announcement and the U.S. Open, where he celebrated 20 years as official outfitter and dressed a plethora of high-profile attendees.

Meantime, he introduced a new A.I. tool that can help customers style their Polo looks (the company had reportedly been working on it for a year, in conjunction with Microsoft), and on the day of his show news came that he was nominated for a Council of Fashion Designers of America award as women’s wear designer of the year. This after already winning in the category nine times.

As to whether he was also looking forward to creating Ms. Swift’s wedding dress, a spokeswoman smiled, shrugged and remained mum.

No matter.

Kroger Co. raised its full-year sales forecast, illustrating that the grocer is attracting value-seeking consumers who are opting to eat at home.

The company said it now expects comparable sales, excluding fuel, to gain as much as 3.4%, versus its previous guidance calling for a high of 3.25% increase.

Kroger’s shares rose as much as 4.4% in premarket trading.

Kroger ranks No. 31 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest private carriers in North America, and No. 3 on the TT grocery list.

Food retailers have posted steady sales in recent years, benefiting from shoppers prioritizing necessities even as they cut spending elsewhere. People are staying cautious overall, buying things on sale or purchasing cheaper items.

The grocery chain’s comparable sales and adjusted earnings beat expectations during the latest quarter, driven by higher sales of fresh food, e-commerce and pharmacy.

Kroger is seeking to establish a new chapter of growth after calling off a $24.6 billion deal with rival Albertsons Cos., a fight that’s now unfolding in court. Kroger’s former chief executive abruptly resigned earlier this year, replaced by industry veteran Ron Sargent until a permanent CEO is named.

Albertsons ranks No. 5 on the grocery carriers list.

Under Sargent, the Cincinnati company has been sharpening focus on the core retail business. It’s accelerating new store openings while closing underperforming ones. Improving e-commerce profitability is another priority, as Kroger works to reduce wait times and move online orders faster. Kroger said in August that it would lay off nearly 1,000 corporate employees to cut costs.

While Kroger has less exposure to tariffs than competitors selling clothes and other general merchandise, the retailer is diversifying sourcing and discontinuing some items in response. The grocer is also emphasizing value, offering promotions, lowering prices and expanding store brands that continue to grow faster than national names. Still, competition has been growing as Walmart Inc. offers more food discounts and Amazon.com Inc. plans to expand grocery delivery offerings.

Browne, an early beta tester of the new Digital Landscapes experience, was able to do.
Insights Designed to Drive Business Results Suppliers can view aggregate metrics on their full Walmart product slate or drill down to the single UPC level.
What’s not available are competitors’ metrics, for obvious reasons, but Lomelino said that with the new search insights, brands will be able to learn a lot about category-level behavior.
“They can allocate their digital spend more effectively, because they understand the digital journey much better with the insights that we provide,” said Lomelino.","There’s been talk for some time about the collapse of the traditional “funnel.” Consumers no longer move along a linear path from awareness to consideration to purchase, and they haven’t for years. Now, with the rise of AI-powered search and discovery, that path to purchase is becoming even more fragmented and variable. But regardless of how ecommerce evolves from here, core hubs of commerce activity and intel will remain — and one of those hubs is the app and website of the world’s largest retailer, Walmart.

Walmart’s digital platforms feature 20 million first-party items that are shopped by millions of consumers every week. That’s a lot of insight into what consumers are looking for and ultimately buying. For years now, Walmart has been working to coalesce that data and make it accessible to its suppliers through the Scintilla suite of insights tools, to help improve not only sales performance but also the customer experience.

“The customer journey is really not linear, and with that level of assortment and all the different entry points into our site and our app, we wanted to provide a product that delivers really robust insights around the digital shopping journey,” said Linda Lomelino, Group Director at Walmart Data Ventures in an interview with Retail TouchPoints. That way, “both suppliers and internal users alike can understand how customers are shopping our site and app, as well as [determining] what these pre-purchase behaviors are so that we can make the customer experience even better going forward.”

Now that data is getting an upgrade with a series of enhancements to Scintilla’s Digital Landscapes tool, including the addition of 15 new metrics and a revamped user experience.

“We see the priorities in the [Walmart] business, and we hear from our suppliers all day,” Lomelino said. “As a product person, you want to make sure that you’re delivering exactly the value that you hope to deliver, and a lot of that [right now] is driven by an increased importance of the PDP [product detail page], but also making sure that we can cater to things like viral moments. And the piece that is really critical is being able to see the metric and then pivot strategy quickly.”

That’s exactly what skin and haircare brand E.T. Browne, an early beta tester of the new Digital Landscapes experience, was able to do. The company noticed a massive surge in transactions for its Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Firming Formula lotion, and using insights from Walmart shopping sessions was able to track the upswing back to a viral moment on TikTok.

“Once they understood what was actually happening, they capitalized on that moment and adjusted their forecasting and replenishment strategy to accommodate the increased traffic coming to that product,” said Lomelino. “They took what could have been a pretty large supply chain challenge and used it to really drive sustained growth going forward.”

What’s New in Digital Landscapes

The Digital Landscapes product launched last June and has been available to Charter members of Scintilla — who pay a subscription fee for enhanced data access and tools — for over a year now. E.T. Browne isn’t alone in finding the enhanced tool useful, with Lomelino saying that the response from beta testers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” Now the experience is live for all Charter members.

Enhancements include a complete redesign of the user experience aimed at making the insights “super consumable,” so that both data experts and non-experts can “visualize the insights in a more effective way and understand what a metric means and how it drives the business,” said Lomelino. “You’ll see things like a Sankey chart [a type of flow diagram] that really beautifully describes how traffic is both coming in and exiting our site and our app, to help [suppliers] understand if there are improvements they can make to drive traffic to their product page or drive conversion.”

The update also includes the addition of 15 incremental metrics, including:

Enhanced traffic insights to show where customers started their journey, whether it be from a social media platform, a search engine, coming directly to the Walmart site or app or any other online channel;

Enhanced conversion insights to visualize how many visitors are actually converting;

The new Digital Basket metric, which shows what customers are adding to their cart and what they are they leaving behind, informing abandonment rates and insights to drive conversion;

New metrics around search, including the keywords customers are using to search a particular category or product, so suppliers can better understand what’s trending, but also what the customer’s frame of mind is as they’re searching; and

The new Content Quality Score metric, which helps suppliers understand the quality of their product content. “As you can imagine, this one is very tactical in terms of places where content can be improved — replace the hero image, add better descriptions, etc.,” said Lomelino.

Insights Designed to Drive Business Results

Suppliers can view aggregate metrics on their full Walmart product slate or drill down to the single UPC level. What’s not available are competitors’ metrics, for obvious reasons, but Lomelino said that with the new search insights, brands will be able to learn a lot about category-level behavior.

“These enhancements can really drive improved digital strategies, whether it’s advertising or supply chain or just a better understanding of how customers search for the category,” Lomelino added. “What we’re trying to drive on our side is improved discoverability, improved product conversion, increased purchases and loyalty over time, which fits in really nicely with the larger mission of becoming America’s favorite place to shop.”

Data Helps Refine Advertising Campaigns

Of course, one of the most important ways suppliers will use this data is to inform their advertising strategies, which at Walmart means the Connect retail media business.

“They can allocate their digital spend more effectively, because they understand the digital journey much better with the insights that we provide,” said Lomelino. “Not only that, but then in real time they can optimize campaigns that are in flight by understanding if the campaign is driving the behaviors they expect it to be driving.”

And of course, given that one of Walmart’s biggest strengths is its physical store network, other Scintilla modules offer omnichannel insights into shopper behavior and product sales performance.

“What we have heard from our suppliers very broadly is that they’re triangulating the Digital Landscapes data with all of the other transactional data so they can optimize for broader messaging,” said Lomelino. “So if you see keyword searches that point to something very specific or something viral, suppliers are obviously going to be able to capitalize on some of those signals and then leverage them, whether it’s in-store or online, through Walmart Connect or their traditional marketing assets.",https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_285824992-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 13:16:16.847921

(NYSE: HPSE) is poised for accelerated growth in 2025 as it integrates Juniper Networks and taps rising demand for AI-powered and hybrid cloud solutions. In its recent third quarter earnings, the company reported net revenue of $9.1 billion, up 18% year-on-year, fueled by strong momentum in AI systems and resilient server demand.

According to Visible Alpha consensus estimates, HPE’s net revenue is forecast to climb 15% year-on-year to $34.5 billion in 2025, followed by a further 17% increase to $40.2 billion in 2026. This compares with a modest 3% rise in 2024.

Hewlett Packard’s acquisition of Juniper Networks, completed in July, is a key driver of this growth as the company repositions itself for the AI and hybrid-cloud era. Analysts expect Juniper to contribute $2 billion in sales in 2025, almost tripling to $5.9 billion in 2026.

Hewlett Packard’s hybrid-cloud business is also gaining traction, buoyed by demand for its GreenLake platform, Alletra MP storage systems, and private-cloud AI deployments. The segment expanded 14% in the third quarter and is forecast to grow 7% to $5.8 billion in 2025, a turnaround from a 1% contraction last year.

Headline Takeaway:

(KHC.O) is in a weak technical position with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 2.61, suggesting investors should exercise caution. Meanwhile, fundamentals show strong signs with a score of 8.72.

News Highlights

Here’s what’s shaping the broader market and industry landscape:

DoorDash CEO Tony Xu’s Aggressive Expansion: DoorDash’s recent $3.9 billion acquisition of Deliveroo highlights the competitive nature of food delivery. While this doesn’t directly affect , it underscores shifting consumer behaviors and growing delivery infrastructure that may impact food brands.

India’s Food Labeling Push: The Indian Supreme Court’s directive to finalize food labeling regulations could influence global food safety expectations, potentially affecting how products like KHC are marketed and perceived.

Food Inflation and Tariffs: The ongoing U.S. tariff debates and food inflation trends suggest potential cost pressures for food producers, which could affect KHC's margins and pricing strategy in the long term.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Five institutions have weighed in recently, with a simple average rating of 3.00 and a performance-weighted rating of 2.64. The ratings show mixed consistency — all five analysts issued a Neutral rating, which aligns with the stock's recent price decline of -3.72%.

Internal diagnostic scores (0-10) for key fundamental metrics and values include:

EV/EBIT: 2.62 — Value: -3.53 times

Net Profit Margin (%): 1.00 — Value: -57.56%

Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (YoY %): 8.72 — Value: 12.61%

Net Profit / Total Operating Revenue (%): 1.00 — Value: -57.56%

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities): 8.08 — Value: 1.48

Annualized Return on Total Assets (%): 1.00 — Value: -15.73%

These metrics reflect a mixed fundamental outlook — strong cash flow and revenue performance clash with weak profit margins and return on assets. Investors should closely watch KHC’s ability to manage costs and maintain profitability amid rising food inflation.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows suggest positive movement overall, with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 7.71 and a rating of “good”. Large and extra-large investors are showing positive trends, with inflow ratios of 48.86% and 52.50%, respectively. In contrast, small investors remain bearish, with a 48.37% inflow ratio but a negative trend.

This divergence highlights that institutional money is flowing in while retail traders are cautious. It suggests a potential setup for a long-term trade if fundamentals and sentiment continue to align.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, The Kraft Heinz is in a weak position, with a internal diagnostic score (0-10) of 2.61 and a clear avoid recommendation. Of the seven indicators analyzed:

Bullish Engulfing (8.08) — A strong bullish candlestick pattern.

MACD Golden Cross (1.00) — A bearish divergence signal.

WR Overbought (1.00) — Suggests overbought conditions, typically a sell signal.

Dividend Record Date (1.00) — History shows a drop of -3.03% after such dates.

MACD Death Cross (2.62) — Suggests a bearish trend.

Recent patterns include a bullish engulfing on 2025-08-29 and a MACD golden cross on 2025-08-27, but these were quickly overwhelmed by bearish signals like the WR overbought and dividend record date.

Overall, the key insights show 6 bearish vs 1 bullish signals. Momentum is weak, and the trend quality is poor — a clear warning sign for technical traders.

Conclusion

While The Kraft Heinz shows strong fundamental performance and positive fund flows, the technical outlook remains bearish with a weak trend and a score of 2.61. Analyst sentiment is neutral, and recent price action supports caution.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363a0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-11 04:00:36.840669

Evercore ISI stated that much of the recent strength in HP’s PC unit could be temporary, driven by tariff worries. The firm pointed out that while the PC market is expected to expand, there is offsetting weakness in printing. HP has guided for fourth-quarter earnings of 87 to 97 cents a share, in line with consensus estimates, and maintained its annual free cash flow outlook of $2.6 billion to $3 billion for fiscal 2025. Management also expects PC margins to remain within the 5% to 7% range, supported by a shift toward AI-enabled PCs that could represent half of shipments within the next two years.

Evercore ISI left its price target unchanged at $29, reflecting its view that the stock is trading around its price target and that further upside is unlikely in the near term. The firm noted that it sees a host of cross currents that could cloud the path to higher EPS/FCF numbers.

This downgrade reflects Evercore ISI’s cautious stance on HP Inc’s earnings prospects, given the potential impact of tariffs on PC demand and the offsetting weakness in the printing segment.

While the company's leadership touts this as a bold step toward long-term value creation, the market has responded with skepticism, slashing KDP's stock price by over 18% in early trading and erasing $8 billion in market valueKeurig Dr Pepper stock downgraded by HSBC on JDE Peet's acquisition[ 3 ]. This divergence between strategic ambition and investor sentiment raises critical questions: Can KDP's high-leverage bet on the global coffee market deliver sustainable growth, or is the company overreaching in a bid to replicate past successes?

Strategic Moves for Long-Term Growth

KDP's 2025 strategy is anchored in three pillars: innovation, diversification, and scale. The company reported robust Q1 2025 results, with net sales rising 4.8% to $3.6 billion and operating income up 4.7% to $801 millionKeurig Dr Pepper Reports Q1 2025 Results and Reaffirms Guidance for 2025[ 1 ]. These figures underscore KDP's ability to execute disciplined cost management and capitalize on high-growth categories like energy drinks, which now generate over $1 billion in annual salesKeurig Dr Pepper stock downgraded by HSBC on JDE Peet's acquisition[ 3 ]. However, the acquisition of JDE Peet's represents a quantum leap in ambition. By merging KDP's single-serve coffee dominance with JDE's global portfolio (including brands like

and Lavazza), the company aims to create a $16 billion annual revenue stream under a new Global Coffee Co. spin-offKeurig Dr Pepper to acquire JDE Peet's[ 4 ].

The rationale for this move is compelling. Coffee consumption is projected to grow at a 4% CAGR through 2030, driven by premiumization and convenience trendsKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) — $18.4B JDE Peet's Deal[ 2 ]. KDP's CEO, Tim Cofer, has emphasized that the acquisition will unlock $400 million in annual cost synergies and drive EPS accretion, while the separation of the coffee and North American beverage businesses is expected to enhance operational clarityKeurig Dr Pepper to acquire JDE Peet's[ 4 ].

Market Skepticism and Risks

Despite these strategic justifications, investors remain wary. The acquisition's all-cash structure and $18.4 billion price tag have pushed KDP's pro-forma net-debt/EBITDA ratio into the mid-to-high-5x range—a level that raises red flags for leveraged buyout specialists and value investors alikeKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) — $18.4B JDE Peet's Deal[ 2 ].

Reconciling the Two Sides

The key to evaluating KDP's strategy lies in reconciling its long-term vision with short-term execution risks. On one hand, the company's free cash flow generation—$1.2 billion in 2024—provides a buffer for debt servicingKeurig Dr Pepper Reports Q1 2025 Results and Reaffirms Guidance for 2025[ 1 ].

Conclusion

Keurig Dr Pepper's JDE Peet's acquisition is a high-stakes gamble that could redefine its trajectory. While the company's Q1 2025 results and energy drink growth demonstrate operational strength, the market's skepticism is warranted given the leverage and integration risks. For long-term value creation to materialize, KDP must execute flawlessly: delivering synergies, separating the businesses cleanly, and navigating the debt burden without sacrificing innovation.

Dive Brief:

Boston Scientific has agreed to buy Elutia’s two bioenvelope products for $88 million, the companies said Tuesday.

The agreement will give Boston Scientific control of Elupro and Cangaroo, devices designed to promote wound healing to prevent complications after pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.

Elupro and Cangaroo compete with Medtronic’s TYRX. BTIG analysts said in a note to investors that they believe “the Elupro bioenvelope may offer clinical and handling advantages over TYRX.”

Dive Insight:

Elutia received clearance for Elupro in June 2024 and began a full commercial launch at the start of 2025. The device has an extracellular matrix to support wound healing and potentially facilitate re-operative procedures by reducing scar formation and fibrosis. Elupro gradually releases the antibiotics rifampin and minocycline into the surrounding tissue to provide antimicrobial protection after the procedure.

Cangaroo is a first-generation version of the product that lacks antibiotics. Elutia made Elupro the focus of its business after securing clearance to sell the bioenvelope in the U.S., telling investors last month that its success is highly dependent on the commercialization, marketing and sale of the device.

Elutia enlisted Boston Scientific to support the launch. Boston Scientific acts as a sales agent for Elutia, giving the company access to around 900 sales representatives and clinical specialists to complement its own direct sales force. The deal is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter. When that happens, Boston Scientific will take over commercialization of the bioenvelopes.

BTIG analysts said they expect the bioenvelopes to be “a relatively low-effort product sale” for Boston Scientific’s sales reps. The technology can be used with many of Boston Scientific’s implantable devices, the analysts said, and will compete with Medtronic’s TYRX. Medtronic’s device is synthetic and lacks the antibiotic-eluting feature of Elupro. The Elutia devices are biomatrices.

The analysts estimate Elupro and TYRX are competing for a $600 million opportunity in the U.S. cardiac rhythm management sector. Bioenvelope revenue was $3.5 million in the second quarter, the analysts said. Elupro, months into its launch, contributed around two-thirds of the sales.

Boston Scientific is paying a valuation multiple that is roughly in line with the historical average for sales of fast-growing businesses, the analysts said. While the bioenvelopes could be of interest to any company that sells pacemakers or defibrillators, the analysts do not expect additional bidders for the assets because Boston Scientific and Elutia already have a close partnership.

As part of the deal, Elutia has agreed to comply with non-competition restrictions for five years. Elutia is shifting its focus to its Simpliderm cellular dermal matrix devices and drug-eluting pipeline in the $1.5 billion U.S. breast reconstruction market.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6HstwfRH3JkbjCoBzgIkxHTrtBKig-09eqcgppOPJ1U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yRk5CNzJYLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-10 11:17:51.016760

“If CVS bought Bartell and Rite Aid stores, they now are owned by CVS,” said Dima Mazen Qato, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.
That’s what happened recently to Nicole J., a Shoreline resident whose prescription file moved from Rite Aid to CVS.
She believes the pharmacy counted CVS’ acquisition of her file from Rite Aid as a transfer.
CVS acquired 49 Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations in Washington this year, as well as the prescription files from 61 others.","After pharmacy chain Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy in May, CVS bought some of its stores, including the Bartell Drugs locations it owned, and patient records across the Pacific Northwest.

For some, the switch has been messy.

Many insurance plans classify pharmacies as either in-network or out-of-network, the same way they do for doctors and medical facilities.

That means some people who have been picking up their medications from their neighborhood pharmacy for years may no longer be able to do so.

“If CVS bought Bartell and Rite Aid stores, they now are owned by CVS,” said Dima Mazen Qato, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California. “CVS is probably not the preferred pharmacy for the same plans for which Rite Aid and Bartell were preferred or in-network.”

Whether a pharmacy falls within an individual’s insurance network varies by plan. At out-of-network pharmacies, people generally must pay full price for their medication, meaning they could face bills in the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

That’s what happened recently to Nicole J., a Shoreline resident whose prescription file moved from Rite Aid to CVS. Nicole asked to be identified by her first name and middle initial to protect her sensitive medical details.

Nicole is on Medicaid, commonly known in Washington as Apple Health, and gets health coverage through the Community Health Plan of Washington. Late last month, she called her new CVS pharmacy for a medication refill. It wasn’t until the prescription was ready for pickup that she learned that CVS isn’t among her plan’s network pharmacies. Out of pocket, she would have had to pay $800 for a month’s supply — a sum she would not have been able to afford.

Her experience is not uncommon. In fact, it happens regularly when pharmacies get bought out or shut down, said Qato.

On social media, Washington residents have complained about long wait times and dead ends when calling to get their records sent from CVS to an in-network pharmacy.

To address potential delays, the state Department of Health in July urged former Rite Aid customers to request refills early so that pharmacies have “ample time” to process them.

CVS acknowledged this week that people might run into issues getting their prescriptions as the pharmacy continues to integrate prescription files from former Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations.

“CVS Pharmacy may be excluded from some payer networks in Washington,” wrote Amy Thibault, executive director of corporate communications. “If that’s the case, the pharmacy team will work with the patient to transfer their prescriptions to an in-network pharmacy, if requested.”

Delays in prescription refills can be problematic.

“Patients that are dealing with disruptions of pharmacy access — whether it’s a closure or basically not being able to go to a pharmacy because it doesn’t cover the cost of your drugs — they’re less likely to fill or adhere to their medication regimens, which has health implications,” said Qato, who is a senior scholar at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC.

Nicole’s issue was compounded by difficulties she had in transferring a controlled drug prescription out of CVS.

Her medication is a Schedule III controlled substance. Under federal drug regulations, patients can only transfer prescriptions for such medications between pharmacies once before they need a new prescription.

Nicole said the pharmacy team at CVS refused to transfer her prescription on the basis that she’d already reached her transfer limit. She believes the pharmacy counted CVS’ acquisition of her file from Rite Aid as a transfer. (A CVS spokesperson wrote in an email that acquisitions of patient files do not count as transfers.)

Ultimately, Nicole reached out to her doctor, who wrote her a new prescription. By the time she finally received her medication, almost a week had lapsed.

“It was just really frustrating,” she said. “You don’t want to have interruptions in medication that you’re trying to take regularly.”

CVS’ takeover comes during a prolonged stretch of difficulty for the pharmacy business. Washington is among the states that has been hardest hit by industrywide closures, which make pharmacies more scarce and difficult for residents to access.

CVS acquired 49 Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations in Washington this year, as well as the prescription files from 61 others.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09082025_CVS_tzr_100506.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-09-10 10:12:24.220889

At the same time, the Google and Criteo deal has the potential to further commoditize sponsored product ads, especially if Google extends its retail media demand partnership to Criteo’s competitors, said one retail media source.
That could push ad serving prices down across the board, forcing adtech players including Criteo to settle for a smaller share of revenue for each retail media ad sold.

The new offering is kicking off during the fourth quarter with a limited beta test in the Americas, but Criteo plans to extend it to any of its more than 200 retail partners globally that show interest, said Sherry Smith, president of retail media at the company.

“Retailers can opt in to receive this demand,” Smith explained. “Every single retailer that we work with, they all want more demand.”

These efforts to funnel new ad dollars into retail media networks through Google could sweeten the pot for Criteo’s retailer clients at a moment when Criteo is facing increasingly fierce competition from a group of smaller competitors vying for market share.

At the same time, the Google and Criteo deal has the potential to further commoditize sponsored product ads, especially if Google extends its retail media demand partnership to Criteo’s competitors, said one retail media source. That could push ad serving prices down across the board, forcing adtech players including Criteo to settle for a smaller share of revenue for each retail media ad sold.

Overall, though, it’s likely beneficial for Criteo as well as the retailers selling ads and the brands buying them, the source said.

“We’re helping advertisers connect with customers at a critical moment in their shopping journey: onsite, through sponsored product ads,” Bill Reardon, general manager of enterprise platform at Google, said in a statement. “Coupled with our existing suite of offsite solutions in Performance Max and Shopping Ads, our goal is to empower advertisers and agencies with a more complete view of their advertising performance, enabling smarter decisions and more effective campaigns.”

By opening up retailer inventory to ad buyers already using Google’s ad management platform, Criteo is effectively lowering the logistical barrier to buying retail ads. Smaller brands and agencies that lack resources might not have the bandwidth to develop relationships with individual retailers—or even with retail media-specific adtech companies like Criteo. Connecting those ad slots to Google makes it possible.

The move builds upon Criteo’s partnership with Mirakl, announced in July, which makes it easier for third-party sellers to buy ads on retail marketplaces.

For retailers aiming to strike a delicate balance between preserving customers’ experience while attracting high-quality ads and cashing in on their high-margin revenue, more demand means more ways to fill ad space left over after whatever gets allotted to major partners during joint-business planning negotiations.

“It is a very big step in unlocking scale for our retail partners to be more efficient—to bring better and more unified measurement,” Smith said. “The intent is to make sure it’s very efficient, it’s very transparent, and that it’s incredibly flexible.”

After the beta test with sponsored product ads, Smith said the goal is to make additional ad formats like onsite display and video available through Google as well.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/large-Criteo-Google_Webart.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-09-10 10:13:04.809916

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., September 10, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In an innovative initiative to improve disaster preparedness and response, Philips, Philips Foundation, and nonprofit MedShare International are collaborating to tackle the healthcare challenges caused by natural disasters.

Unlike traditional reactive disaster response programs, this initiative prioritizes disaster preparedness as a strategy to save lives and create continuity of care. MedShare will have Philips medical equipment and other essential products on hand, ensuring these resources are available for rapid deployment when natural disasters disrupt access to healthcare. Prompted by the critical need highlighted during Hurricane Helene in 2024 [1], this strategic partnership has been designed to supply essential medical equipment and supplies to enable continuity of care to people and communities in need during times of crisis.

""By working hand-in-hand with Philips and the Philips Foundation, we’re not only staging life-saving medical equipment for rapid deployment following disasters, but we’re also reimagining sustainability in emergency response,"" said Stacey Koehnke, CEO and Executive Director of MedShare International. ""Together, we’re building an innovative, resilient, forward-looking system that saves lives today and strengthens response capacity for the challenges of tomorrow.""

The need for a proactive and sustainable approach to disaster response has never been more urgent. Natural disasters are increasingly compromising access to healthcare across the United States, with nearly 400 climate disasters causing over $1 billion in damages each in the past 45 years [2], causing severe damage to so many families and communities.

Philips North America is contributing ultrasound systems capable of cardiac, vascular, obstetric and gynecological imaging. These technologies, to be staged and deployed by MedShare, are supported by field service engineers for installation, maintenance and de-installation to ensure effective deployment in challenging environments. Additionally, the donation of essential mother-and-child care products such as feeding bottles and pacifiers will help to address urgent needs in disaster-affected areas.

""Every human life holds immeasurable value, and that belief drives everything we do,"" said Jeff DiLullo, Chief Region Leader, Philips North America. ""In times of crisis, access to quality healthcare becomes even more critical. Our partnership with MedShare and the Philips Foundation reflects our deep commitment to using innovation and collaboration to protect and uplift vulnerable communities when they need us most.""

Philips Foundation will provide financial aid and strategic guidance, drawing on over a decade of experience in disaster relief. In 2024 alone, the Foundation helped respond to major crises across the world, including the Noto Peninsula Earthquake in Japan and the devastating floods in Brazil, Poland, and Spain, by ensuring the rapid delivery of critical medical equipment and services.

Eddine Sarroukh, Head of the Philips Foundation, stated: ""By combining Philips’ healthcare expertise with MedShare’s extensive network, we are responding to disasters and building a resilient system that supports continuity of care for the most vulnerable communities. It's great that we are teaming up with a like-minded partner to establish a disaster-preparedness model for rapid response and continuity during emergencies, we hope to see scaled.""

This two-year pilot program will serve as a model for future expansion, with a focus on durability and scalability. A key component of the program is the reusability of the donated medical equipment, which will be shipped back to MedShare for reprocessing and redeployment after each emergency. This approach not only maximizes the impact of each device but also sets a new standard, supporting reuse and encouraging environmentally practices in disaster response.

HARTFORD, CT, September 10, 2025 — CVS Health® (NYSE: CVS) Foundation announced today that it is awarding $1 million in general operating grants through its Hometown Fund to 20 organizations surrounding the Hartford area.

TWi reached a settlement with Takeda 10 years ago, which delayed the entry of its Dexilant generic into the U.S. market until January 2022. In the lawsuit, CVS said that based on applicable patent expirations, TWi could have reached the market in June 2020.

The arrangement also allowed the Japanese pharma giant and Taiwan-based TWi to avoid competition from other generic drug makers even after Takeda’s patent protection for Dexilant had expired, according to the lawsuit.

Like the other retailers, CVS called the deal a “reverse payment"" agreement in which Takeda paid TWi to keep its generic off the market. Such settlements are often referred to as ""pay-for-delay"" agreements.

CVS alleges that the companies’ collusion increased its expenses in purchasing Dexilant for sales to its customers. In the March lawsuit, Walgreens made the same argument, joined by other retailers Kroger, Albertsons and H-E-B.

The CVS lawsuit also names TWi's new parent company, Bora Pharmaceuticals, and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, another Bora subsidiary that merged with and succeeded TWi. Bora acquired TWi in 2022 and Upsher-Smith Laboratories in 2024.

Q3 2024: A Turnaround Driven by Strategic Execution

By Q3 2024, Aramark had not only recovered but exceeded expectations. The company reported record revenue of $4.4 billion, with organic growth of 11% year-over-year across all business lines and geographiesWhat You Need to Know About Aramark's Q3 Earnings[ 3 ]. This performance was underpinned by three key factors:

Cost Management and Supply Chain Efficiency: Aramark's global supply chain team optimized spend, contributing to a 22% year-over-year increase in operating incomeARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ]. The company also anticipates surpassing $20 billion in global supply chain and GPO network spend by fiscal year-endARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ], a testament to its ability to scale efficiencies.

New Client Acquisition: A robust sales pipeline and strategic client wins, particularly in corporate catering and institutional food services, drove volume growthARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ].

Innovation and Partnerships: The collaboration with Michelin-starred chef Daniel Boulud to enhance culinary offerings exemplifies Aramark's focus on differentiationAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ]. This move targets high-margin segments like special events and premium corporate catering, aligning with broader trends in experiential dining.

Navigating Macroeconomic Headwinds: Pricing and Domestic Sourcing

Despite these successes, macroeconomic challenges persist. Inflation and potential tariffs remain risks, yet management has adopted a proactive stance. By leveraging pricing strategies and increasing domestic sourcingAramark (ARMK) Stock Price, Market Cap, Segmented ...[ 4 ], Aramark aims to mitigate input cost volatility. This approach mirrors broader industry trends, where companies are reconfiguring supply chains to reduce reliance on globalized networks.

The Uniform Services spin-off, now largely completed, further insulates the core business from cyclical fluctuations in uniform demandAramark Q3 2023 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. This structural change enhances focus on higher-growth areas, such as food services, which are less susceptible to macroeconomic shocks.

Assessing Sustainability: A Balancing Act

The sustainability of Aramark's growth hinges on its ability to maintain operational discipline while scaling innovation. The Q3 2024 results demonstrate that the company can execute under pressure, but long-term success will depend on:

- Continued Cost Optimization: Sustaining supply chain efficiencies in a volatile environment.

- Strategic Partnerships: Leveraging collaborations like the one with Boulud to capture premium pricing.

- Geographic Diversification: The international segment's 16% organic growth in Q3 2023ARAMARK Earnings Call Transcript FY24 Q3[ 1 ] suggests that expanding into emerging markets could buffer against U.S.-centric risks.

Conclusion: A Transient Setback, Not a Structural Crisis

Aramark's Q3 2023 revenue miss was a transient setback, not a sign of systemic weakness. The company's subsequent performance, coupled with strategic initiatives to address macroeconomic risks, reinforces its capacity to sustain growth. While challenges remain, the combination of operational agility, innovation, and disciplined cost management positions Aramark to thrive in a complex environment. For investors, the key takeaway is that the revenue miss was a symptom of broader economic turbulence, not a flaw in the business model itself.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 13:14:37.918201

Thales, which will assess the feasibility of a 5G D2D terminal with a directional antenna operating in the future C band.
“This new 5G D2D project paves the way for Thales Alenia Space to provide high-speed coverage in areas not served by terrestrial networks, as well as emergency or continuity services in crisis situations,” said Stéphane Anjuère, 5G Venture Leader for Thales Alenia Space.
“We are particularly proud to be contributing to this strategic initiative alongside Thales Alenia Space, Thales, and all of our partners, and to be collaborating once again with CNES to advance French and European technological sovereignty.”","Capgemini, a specialist in business and technology transformation, Thales, a global player in advanced technologies for the Defence, Aerospace and Cyber & Digital sectors, and Thales Alenia Space, a joint company between Thales (67 per cent) and Leonardo (33 per cent), have been selected by the French Space Agency (CNES) as part of a government-backed call for projects under the France 2030 programme to lead an innovative demonstration of 5G direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity.

The project named U DESERVE 5G will demonstrate the feasibility of direct communications between satellites and mobile devices or fixed terminals (5G direct to device, or D2D). A demonstrator satellite will be placed in low-Earth orbit to test interoperability between terrestrial and nonterrestrial 5G networks. The project will use a set of scenarios to evaluate how smoothly devices can switch between satellite and terrestrial 5G coverage, which is a crucial step toward truly global, seamless and uninterrupted connectivity.

At a time when anytime, anywhere connectivity has become a strategic priority — both to meet market demand and ensure infrastructure resilience in crisis situations — satellite technology is emerging as a crucial and complementary solution alongside terrestrial networks.

At the heart of the project is an innovative 5G satellite payload with an active antenna. It will enable voice calls and data transmission directly between the satellite and a test mobile device, without routing via a ground station. The demonstrator will include all components of the chain: test satellite, payload, NTN ground segment and test mobile devices. It will be compatible with Release 17 of the 3GPP 5G standard and will provide an end-to-end test platform to evaluate the performance of the 5G NTN/TN system and trial use cases, especially involving the Internet of Things (IoT).

Drawing on its expertise in telecommunications and its successful efforts to promote satellite 5G standardisation, Thales Alenia Space will lead the consortium, which brings together:

Capgemini, responsible for radio access solutions and 4G/5G core networks.

Thales, which will assess the feasibility of a 5G D2D terminal with a directional antenna operating in the future C band.

Orange, which will contribute its operator expertise and host the demonstration at its Bercenay facility in France.

SES, in charge of studying the implementation of D2D services.

Qualcomm, which will supply a 5G NTN-compatible test mobile terminal.

Loft Orbital, responsible for the platform, AIT (assembly, integration, testing), launch reservation and satellite operations for the demonstration phase.

“This new 5G D2D project paves the way for Thales Alenia Space to provide high-speed coverage in areas not served by terrestrial networks, as well as emergency or continuity services in crisis situations,” said Stéphane Anjuère, 5G Venture Leader for Thales Alenia Space. “By leveraging its expertise in geostationary telecommunications and medium- and low-Earth orbit constellations, our company has played a key role in the standardisation of 5G by satellite and is ideally positioned to support future large-scale 5G D2D projects.”

“This pioneering 5G-by-satellite project represents a major breakthrough for Thales and the telecommunications industry,” said Alexandre Bottero, VP Networks and Infrastructure Systems for Thales. “By developing 5G NTN D2D modem solutions enabling high-speed connectivity, even in the most remote areas, we’re laying the groundwork for the future of global communications and stepping up our commitment to a more connected and resilient world.”

“This project perfectly emphasises Capgemini’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of connectivity. Thanks to our unique expertise in integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, in addition to our mastery of radio access solutions and 4G/5G core networks, Capgemini is playing a key role in demonstrating 5G via satellite,” added Angélique Lallouet, Executive Director of Capgemini Engineering in France. “We are particularly proud to be contributing to this strategic initiative alongside Thales Alenia Space, Thales, and all of our partners, and to be collaborating once again with CNES to advance French and European technological sovereignty.”",https://www.advanced-television.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/France-e1632927980564.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:11:23.932922

But while the benefits are clear, a new global study from the Capgemini Research Institute published today, ‘The On-Demand tech paradox: balancing speed and spend’, reveals that rising costs, complexity, and governance gaps are putting returns at risk. With growing demand for digital infrastructure, organizations are struggling to contain technology costs due to lack of cost visibility, underutilized resources, as well as a legacy mindset.

Organizations are pivoting from capital-intensive IT investments to flexible, consumption-based models and On-Demand technologies. According to the report, IT and technology spend is projected to rise and the share of On-Demand tech in IT budgets is expected to grow from 29% to 41% over the next year. The majority (77%) of executives view cloud scalability and performance as critical to business growth and differentiation, as it allows their organizations to scale innovation, accelerate time-to-market and stay competitive. Despite these benefits, many organizations are struggling to harness these On-Demand technologies while maintaining costs.

“The surge of On-Demand technologies – such as Public Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI – has reshaped how leading businesses operate. These tools offer unparalleled convenience, but they come with a financial implication,” said Karine Brunet, CEO of Cloud Infrastructure Services at Capgemini and member of the Group Executive Committee. “While On-Demand technology expenses are projected to double over the next three to four years, organizations must find a way to gain transparency and control over costs while elevating value. Those that align their cloud strategy with their overall business goals are well positioned to harness this opportunity. By designing scalable, modular, cloud-native and frugal architecture, they are set-up to drive sustainable value through smarter FinOps, integrated governance, and AI-driven automation.”

On-Demand technologies are driving tech and IT spending, but not without challenges

While the more advanced adopters of On-Demand tech are already reaping rewards — from cost savings and faster product innovation to improved service quality and operational productivity, less mature adopters are finding that the road ahead is not without its challenges. These include:

Soaring costs and complexity: 82% of executives report significant increases in cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI costs. Inflation, AI adoption, and digital infrastructure demands are key drivers.

Budget overruns: 76% of organizations exceeded their public cloud budgets (by an average of 10%), while 68% overspent on Gen AI and 52% on SaaS. Underutilized resources and decentralized procurement are major culprits.

Shadow IT and security risks: Business units now drive 59% of Gen AI and 48% of SaaS spending. 12% of all SaaS spending is unmanaged. Nearly all executives (98%) admit to bypassing IT for tech purchases, creating inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities.

Limited ROI realization: Despite heavy investments, only 29% achieved expected SaaS cost savings, 33% saw desired cloud service quality, and 38% realized faster innovation with Gen AI.

FinOps, a critical yet underdeveloped discipline to optimize costs and elevate On-Demand tech value

According to the survey, 60% of organizations use cloud cost management tools, but only 37% evaluate their effectiveness or act on insights. While three quarters of the organizations surveyed (76%) have or plan to establish FinOps teams, most remain narrowly focused and operational in nature. Only 2% who have a dedicated FinOps function cover cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI holistically, and just 42% influence business decisions.

In addition, more than half (53%) of the organizations agree that suboptimal On-Demand tech usage leads to excessive energy consumption and increased carbon emissions. Despite this, only 36% of organizations have a strategy for integrating sustainability into FinOps. Integrating practices such as developing energy-efficient architectures, optimizing computing and storage, switching off idle resources and scheduling workloads can reduce costs as well as carbon.

Report Methodology

The Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 1,000 executives from global organizations with annual revenue of at least $1 billion who are consuming On-Demand technologies (Cloud, SaaS, and Gen AI on Cloud) in 12 sectors and 14 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The global survey was carried out in May 2025. To supplement the findings, Capgemini also conducted in-depth discussions with 10 executives from global organizations.

""If I can use big words, it's a facile and fallacious logic,"" the Barclays chief told CNBC's Sarah Eisen in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday.
Pressed on the direct consequences of an increased levy, the Barclays chief laid out a stark scenario.
""We would have to find ways to get greater productivity, pull back on hiring, and actually issue less credit into the U.K. economy,"" he said.
As an alternative to raising taxes on banks, Venkatakrishnan urged the government to focus its spending on long-term investments designed to reverse a national decline in productivity.","Barclays Chief Executive C.S. Venkatakrishnan criticized a proposal to raise taxes on British banks, warning the ""facile and fallacious logic"" behind such a move would compel the lender to cut back on hiring and reduce lending to the British economy. Venkatakrishnan said that further burdening a sector already facing one of the highest tax rates globally is not a viable solution to the U.K.'s difficult fiscal situation. ""If I can use big words, it's a facile and fallacious logic,"" the Barclays chief told CNBC's Sarah Eisen in a wide-ranging interview Tuesday. ""Take the banking sector [in the U.K.], which is already paying a tax rate of 48%, higher than almost any other banking sector."" Contrasting the figure with rates in other major financial hubs, Venkatakrishnan continued, ""New York is like 26%, and even the highest in Europe is like 39%, so adding to that is not a path towards economic growth."" In the U.K., banks pay a 3% surcharge on the standard corporate tax rate, which stands at 25%. The Barclays chief executive, however, was referring to a much broader measure known as the ""total tax rate,"" which aims to capture the entire tax burden that falls on a company as a direct cost, representing a percentage of its commercial profits. The figures were compiled by the consultancy PwC for the trade lobby UK Finance. The U.K. government is reportedly considering raising the bank surcharge by up to 2% in November to help offset part of an estimated £20 billion deficit in its annual budget. London finds itself needing to raise taxes or cut spending drastically after a rise in inflation expectations drove up U.K. bond yields. The U.K. government has also had to reverse its policy on cuts to welfare after political backlash. Robert Woods, chief U.K. economist at Panthen Macroeconomics, said ""we estimate that in its forthcoming Budget forecast, the OBR will raise forecast debt-interest costs at the five-year forecast horizon by only [£3 billion]"" in a note to clients on September 8. The U.K. Treasury did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Pressed on the direct consequences of an increased levy, the Barclays chief laid out a stark scenario. ""We would have to find ways to get greater productivity, pull back on hiring, and actually issue less credit into the U.K. economy,"" he said. The reason, he explained, is that the bank ""wouldn't have as much capital to reinvest back into the system."" The warning carries significant weight, as Venkatakrishnan noted that the financial services industry accounts for 10% of the U.K. economy and serves as a major source of export earnings for the country. London-listed Barclays shares have risen 40% in 2025, and the lender reported a near-record net profit of about £6 billion ($8.1 billion) in the latest 12-month period ending June 2025, according to FactSet. Barclays also trades in New York. BARC-GB YTD line A 'pro-business government' Despite his critique of the specific tax proposal, Venkatakrishnan also expressed broad confidence in the current government's handling of the economy. He acknowledged that officials have to make difficult choices regarding taxation and spending, but described the administration as supportive of companies. ""It is a pro-business government. It is absolutely pro-business. I have felt it since the day they walked in,"" he said, adding that the government understands the importance of the financial sector to the nation's economy. As an alternative to raising taxes on banks, Venkatakrishnan urged the government to focus its spending on long-term investments designed to reverse a national decline in productivity. ""That spending has to be investment: investment in housing, investment in infrastructure, investment in long-term productivity,"" he said.

In the Americas, including the US, its second biggest market, Inditex saw sales fall 3.8 in the first half, citing a 'complex' market.

The company's investor relations director, Gorka Garcia-Tapia, told analysts the 'complex' comment referred to US tariffs and trade wars, as well as foreign exchange swings.

Donald Trump has implemented a 15 per cent levy on goods imported from the EU.

Inditex, which is the world's largest fashion retailer, said second quarter sales rose to €10.08billion in the three months to the end of July.

While an improvement on the previous quarter, analysts had been expecting growth of around 3.4 per cent.

But Inditex said sales accelerated in recent weeks after the successful launch of its latest autumn and winter clothing lines. The business said its new collections had been 'very well received' by shoppers.

The group reported a 9 per cent rise in sales across its stores and online between 1 August and 7 September

The Spanish retail firm, which also owns the Pull & Bear and Bershka brands, revealed total sales grew by 1.6 per cent to £15.9billion in the first half, with sales rising 5.1 per cent after adjusting for currency rates.

Sales for the group’s Zara business grew slightly to £11.4billion, but represented a slowdown in growth amid pressure on consumer finances.

Oscar García Maceiras, chief executive of Inditex, said: 'We have again achieved a solid performance in this first half of 2025, with satisfactory sales in a complex market environment and keeping strong levels of profitability.

'The efficient execution accomplished by our teams demonstrates the strength of Inditex’s business model.'

Separately on Wednesday Primark owner Associated British Foods said the retail chain saw trading improve in recent months despite 'consumer caution', as its UK and stores recovered ground.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Inditex was 'navigating a challenging path.'

He added: 'Its products are more expensive [than Primark's], which means the goods must sparkle to convince cautious shoppers to part with their cash.

'The difference between Inditex and Primark is that the former is more upbeat about current trading, explaining why its shares jumped on its update.

'Both Inditex and Primark have US operations and they’re having to contend with tariffs and unfavourable foreign exchange rates.

“We are delighted that our first solar power plant will be located here, in a division that combines long-standing traditions with modern solutions. This is the final stage of an investment package worth nearly PLN 50 million, implemented over the past year,” emphasized branch director Marek Adamczyk.

The investment covered three large-scale projects. The first was the introduction of a thermal regenerative afterburner, which halved gas consumption and reduced CO2 emissions by 50%. The second was the installation of an innovative rapid sheet cooling system on the galvanizing line, developed in Liège, Belgium. The third was the replacement of the zinc bath lining, which will ensure safe operation in the coming years.

Szczecin President Daniel Beger emphasized that the decision to build a power plant is a significant step towards the sustainable development of the city and demonstrates the company’s willingness to combine industrial production with innovation.

The entities said their signing of what is claimed to be a UK-first Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) agreement will streamline collaboration on ‘mutually beneficial’ research and innovation projects across cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgery, and diabetes.

The latest agreement builds on an existing partnership that has resulted in improved care and clinical outcomes for patients over the past decade through piloting medtech solutions in MFT-operated hospitals, according to a joint statement by Medtronic and the MFT. These include the remote monitoring pathway TriageHP Plus, which has reduced the number of hospitalisations due to heart failure.

In October 2024, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended the NHS use the pathway for heart failure patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices.

Medtronic UK and Ireland senior director Dr Matthew Williams-Gray commented: “By co-developing novel solutions in cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical surgery, and diabetes, we aim to accelerate the transformation of healthcare and improve patient outcomes.”

A key role for MFT under the RDI will be in facilitating the use of anonymised clinical data for public and private benefit through its Clinical Data Science Unit.

The pair-up will also involve the use of Medtronic’s product portfolio to increase remote patient monitoring and community care-based provisions on the NHS. MFT’s hosted infrastructure, including the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) HealthTech Research Centre (HRC) in Emergency and Acute Care, will support this aspect of the initiative.

More broadly, the RDI agreement resonates with technological strategies outlined under the UK Labour Government’s 10-year plan for the NHS, which outlines shifts from hospital to more community-centred care and the transition from an analogue to a more digital health service.

To support these ambitions, the government announced a £29bn ($39.1bn) funding boost to the NHS in June, reflecting a 3% annual rise on current levels over the next three years to reach £226bn by 2029.

Dr Katherine Boylan, deputy managing director of research and innovation at MFT, commented: “This collaboration provides a huge opportunity to pioneer breakthroughs in healthcare and accelerate our joint projects to design and deliver innovative research that will really make a difference in the NHS.”",https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/09/shutterstock_2472349537.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:36.294035

Increasing these tax rates, or adding further taxes, could dent the attractiveness of the UK for investment.
In his comments to the conference earlier this week, Venkatakrishnan said Barclays remained committed to the UK, highlighting its target to deploy £30bn of risk-weighted assets in the UK by 2026.","The chief executive of Barclays has warned the government against the introduction of additional bank taxes, days after UK lenders’ share prices crashed over fears of a new profit levy.

Speaking at a Barclays conference earlier this week, CS Venkatakrishnan said any more taxation on banks would harm the government’s aims of growing the economy, as he recommitted to the bank’s investment in its UK operations.

“Additional bank taxes in the UK . . . are not a good idea in any way, shape, or form, and if I can be clear . . . that is not a path to higher growth in the UK and most economists would agree,” Venkatakrishnan said.

UK banks’ share prices dived last week after the Institute for Public Policy Research — a think-tank — recommended various taxes on lenders’ profits as a way to fill the current government budget deficit. NatWest, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group all saw their shares drop between 2 per cent and 5 per cent on the fears that a levy might be introduced, focusing on the profits gained from deposits held at the Bank of England as a result of quantitative easing.

The think-tank predicted this could prevent between £35bn and £40bn of taxpayer losses over the course of this parliament, and boost the government’s fiscal headroom by between £5bn and £7bn.

Banks currently pay around 45 per cent in tax in the UK — among the highest across global financial centres — which includes 25 per cent in corporation tax (a tax on profits), the banking surcharge, which is 3 per cent of profits, and the bank levy which is 0.1 per cent of UK balance sheets. Increasing these tax rates, or adding further taxes, could dent the attractiveness of the UK for investment.

However, analysts dismissed the market’s reaction to the proposed levy, highlighting it would be antithetical to the government’s pro-growth aims, comments echoed by Venkatakrishnan this week.

In his comments to the conference earlier this week, Venkatakrishnan said Barclays remained committed to the UK, highlighting its target to deploy £30bn of risk-weighted assets in the UK by 2026.

“[W]e are extremely confident in the UK we are committed to that extra £30bn . . . and we expect that as our home market to be a growing central part of the bank.”

He expressed support in the current government, despite concerns over its ability to tackle low growth, and dismissed concerns over rising gilt yields, saying that UK yields — which reached their highest level since 1998 last week — have moved with global yields, which is largely technical and is not a fundamental issue.

“The fundamental issue in the UK at the moment is growth, [and] the government has this absolutely front of mind and I am confident that they are up to the challenge,” he said.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/b7e13e93-c06a-43cf-9f37-89fa5b8527a9.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:11:13.083282

Get The Future You Want | www.capgemini.com About the Capgemini Research Institute The Capgemini Research Institute is Capgemini's in-house think-tank on all things digital.","Capgemini-Over the past five years, software initiatives have resulted in average efficiency improvements of 14%, with benefits projected to reach 24% by 2029.

Most automotive organizations anticipate that software will be the single biggest source of competitive advantage over the next five years, but so far only a few have fully scaled their efforts

The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation as software becomes increasingly central to its business strategy and operations. According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, 'The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles', nearly all automotive organizations (92%) now anticipate that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM)[1] services. Over eight in ten believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition.

According to the report, while ambitions are strong, less than half of automotive organizations have scaled their SDM initiatives in 2025: 34% have partially scaled at least one SDM use case, and just 14% have achieved full-scale deployment.

While decoupling hardware and software has emerged as crucial to enable faster innovation, drive improved scalability, and unlock new revenue streams, the survey shows that only one in ten original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has made progress in this journey, with just over a quarter actively piloting new approaches.

'For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,' said Laurence Noel, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini. 'Forward-looking automotive organizations are already treating software as their core product and leveraging key partnerships to expand their ecosystem. While the ambition is high, it requires a complete organizational overhaul. Those that align their talent, platforms, and partnerships, while fostering trust and delivering an elevated customer experience, will stay ahead of the curve.'

Strategic partnerships and ecosystem collaboration are accelerating the shift to SDM

According to the report, automotive organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with big tech and hyperscalers for critical software, cloud, and data capabilities. While only a few have established joint ventures so far, a third plan to do so within three years. Up to 84% are exploring new supplier markets to build resilience, and nearly 70% are doubling down on in-house development of key components to retain control over brand-defining technologies. Organizations are also restructuring their supply chains for geopolitical resilience, by exploring new sourcing markets including India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe.

Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs. According to the report, their share of OEMs' total revenue is projected to double, contributing to over 50% by 2035.

AI is driving a new era of innovation in the auto industry

The report highlights that a vast majority (85%) agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, embedded directly into software features and functions, from improving in-vehicle experiences to powering advanced safety features and cybersecurity.

Over three-quarters (77%) see AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services as a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, boosting productivity and efficiency, and enhancing product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation. Notably, most surveyed organizations view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization's software-driven strategy.

Software-driven mobility demands an organizational overhaul to reap its full potential

According to the survey, most organizations (86%) believe SDM strategy demands an overhaul of the organizational model, leading to significant changes in processes, and the need to build new skill sets. In addition to structural changes, organizations face a range of challenges in software engineering, compliance, safety, cybersecurity, leadership, and talent acquisition. Over eight in ten (83%) organizations identify the creation of a unified software platform[2] as a key component of their software-driven mobility strategy.

Report Methodology

In June 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 600 executives from 200 long-established automotive organizations, with no more than four respondents from each organization. These executives represented organizations across four segments: OEMs, suppliers, mobility service providers, and digital natives from countries across North America, Europe, and APAC. The surveys were complemented by interviews with more than fifteen industry experts.

[1] By SDM, we mean the full realization of opportunities provided by software for automotive products and services, and the means to achieve it. It is expected to deliver on one hand, significantly enhanced mobility experiences and value for customers and users, and on the other hand, much better control of the overall complexity of vehicles and across the value chain. It focuses on:

Setting the foundation of a 'software platform,' that defines all products and services. This includes Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs), all in-vehicle software, digital user services for mobility and all related backend systems (incl. those ensuring safety, cybersecurity and compliance)

Streamlining 'software delivery' to craft the products and services. It relies on a 'software engineering framework' i.e., an integrated and industrialized set of processes, methods, and tools to design, build, operate, and maintain, with a specific focus on testing, quality, and performance

Accelerating to transform into a 'software company.' It covers the transition of business strategy, execution of change management, and addresses culture and talent.

The industrial sector is a major contributor to this environmental challenge.

According to Capgemini, the sector is responsible for more than 35% of greenhouse gas emissions, with Scope 3 emissions accounting for 70% of this figure.

Capgemini’s 'Building Sustainable Value Chains' report states that without intervention, rising emissions could lead to a global temperature increase of 4.1–4.8°C by 2100, which far surpasses the 1.5–2°C target set by the Paris Agreement.

However, this push for sustainable transformation also offers a considerable opportunity for businesses to improve cost efficiency, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

The complexities of corporate decarbonisation

While sustainability is a priority for many corporations, executing a successful strategy remains a substantial challenge.

Half of all companies acknowledge they are not on schedule with their Scope 3 decarbonisation targets and 67% report having low confidence in their ability to create and implement mature roadmaps for change.

Several barriers contribute to this difficulty, including:

difficulty in making a strong business case for long-term sustainability investments.

complexity in tracking and accurately reporting carbon emissions.

obstacles in decarbonising supply chains.

limited scalability of low-carbon technologies.

The challenge is further complicated by variations between sectors. In industries such as cement, steel and mining, Scope 1 emissions are the primary concern.

In contrast, for sectors like chemicals, electronics and food, the main issue lies with Scope 3 emissions, necessitating deep collaboration with suppliers, manufacturers and consumer brands.

“Building a sustainable value chain is an iterative process,” explain Cyril Garcia, Group Executive Board Member and Head of Sustainability at Capgemini and Charlotte Pierron-Perlès, Global Head of Intelligent Industry at Capgemini Invent, in the report.

“It requires a balanced approach between short-term quick wins, such as energy efficiency and sustainable product design improvements and long-term action, such as strategising on the product portfolio, sustainable asset investment and supply chain redesign.”

The business case for sustainability

Despite these obstacles, there is strong evidence supporting the advantages of developing sustainable value chains.

Sustainable practices can directly improve cost efficiency by lowering energy consumption, reducing carbon taxes and optimising operational processes.

For instance, a packaging redesign guided by a life-cycle assessment cut a product's carbon footprint from 10 to three kgCO₂e while also reducing costs.

In another case, an automotive project successfully lowered Scope 1 emissions by 27% and Scope 2 emissions by 13% across 17 different sites.

Circular business models have also shown impressive results, with the water and automotive sectors demonstrating material savings of up to 50% and cost reductions of 70%.

Furthermore, the use of digital twins and AI models enabled one heavy industry client to decrease its kiln energy consumption by 15% and shorten development cycles by 70%.

A framework for successful transformation

Capgemini has outlined three core pillars that underpin a successful value chain transformation.

The first is sustainable product design, which involves integrating eco-friendly materials, energy efficiency and circularity from the initial design phase to lower costs, extend product life and enhance competitiveness.

The second pillar, sustainable manufacturing, focuses on moving to low-carbon energy sources, improving water and waste efficiency and adopting circular production models to reduce both emissions and operational expenses.

The final pillar, sustainable supply chains, involves responsible sourcing, logistics optimisation and ESG transparency to minimise reliance on vulnerable resources and bolster resilience against market volatility.

Data, digitalisation and AI are crucial in expediting this sustainable transformation.

These technologies facilitate predictive modelling, improved decision-making and traceability throughout the value chain.

For example, one manufacturer with 8,000 suppliers and 350,000 product references used an automated product carbon footprint system to develop a thorough decarbonisation roadmap. “Digital transformation and AI are a formidable opportunity to get faster and improve decision-making throughout this transformation as they help achieve better designs, more productive assets and more flexible supply chains,” say Cyril and Charlotte in the report.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/390a472582df92980380e0c739298e65:d348d3787c6624b7085c581ca8de0bac/cap-energy.webp.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 07:09:39.551698

“The Enable Hernia Repair clinical study didn’t just meet primary endpoints, it far surpassed them,” said Dr. Jacob Greenberg, national principal investigator of the Enable Hernia Repair study and gastrointestinal surgeon at Duke University Hospital. “I am proud to have had the opportunity to advance clinical research in robotic-assisted surgery for the benefit of patients in the United States and around the world.”

Enable Hernia Repair is a prospective, multi-centre, single-arm pivotal study that included 193 patients undergoing either inguinal or ventral robotic hernia repair with the Medtronic Hugo RAS system. Key findings include:

The study met the primary effectiveness endpoint:

̵ The surgical success rate† was 100%, surpassing the pre-specified performance goal of 85%. (p<0.0001)

The study met the primary safety endpoint for both cohorts, which were analyzed independently:

̵ Inguinal: Among 92 patients available for analysis, the surgical site event‡ (SSE) rate was 0.0%, which is significantly lower than, and meeting, the pre-determined performance goal of 30% (p <0.0001).

̵ Ventral: Among 94 patients available for analysis, the SSE rate was 2.1%, which is significantly lower than, and meeting, the pre-determined performance goal of 30% (p <0.0001); two SSEs were recorded and resolved without complication.

“The addition of the Hugo platform to our field introduces exciting new opportunities to innovate and advance robotics in the best interests of patients, surgeons, and hospital systems while clearly offering the clinical results we expect from robotic-assisted surgery,” said Dr. David Chen, a general surgeon at UCLA and lead presenter of the Enable Hernia Repair data at the American Hernia Society (AHS) meeting in Nashville, Tenn.

Every year, nearly 1.5 million hernia repair surgeries are performed in the United States, making hernia repair one of the most common surgeries for adult men and women. Hernia repair addresses conditions where part of the intestine bulges through weakened abdominal muscles. Left untreated, hernias can lead to pain, digestive troubles, swelling, or infection. Surgical repair is currently the leading effective treatment, with innovation in minimally invasive approaches including mesh technology helping advance patient care.

In the Enable Hernia Repair clinical study, the mean length of hospital stay was 4.7 hours for inguinal patients and 6.7 hours for ventral.

“We’re grateful for the opportunity to partner with clinical teams to treat this common and often painful condition for millions of patients around the world,” said Rajit Kamal, vice president and general manager of Robotic Surgical Technologies within the Surgical business of Medtronic. “Adding a digitally-powered robotic-assisted surgery system to our laparoscopic and open surgery solutions for hernia repair gives surgeons more choice and patients greater access to the care they need — and we believe that’s a win for everyone.”

The study builds on the growing body of evidence for Hugo including the Expand URO U.S. clinical study, which also met safety and effectiveness endpoints, and nearly 300 independent publications by surgeons using the Hugo RAS system.

Born out of Medtronic’s 75-year commitment to expanding access to minimally invasive surgical options worldwide in partnership with clinicians, the Hugo RAS system is clinically used in 30+ countries on five continents.

In the U.S., the company’s submission for a urology indication is under review by the Food and Drug Administration, with a U.S. urology indication expected later in the company’s current fiscal year, followed by planned indication expansions into hernia repair and gynecology.

The Medtronic Hugo RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies. Regulatory requirements of individual countries and regions will determine approval, clearance, or market availability.

Technology enables insurers to offer modular and “pick-and-choose” insurance products. Instead of a rigid, one-size-fits-all policy, young professionals can select specific riders and benefits that align with their current needs and financial constraints. For example, they can start with a basic term life plan and add riders for critical illness or disability as their income and responsibilities grow. Our product offerings enable such flexible choices for customers and our technology platforms enable the customer to add such riders at any point in their policy term digitally as per their need and convenience.

Could you share how Bharti AXA Life is utilising AI to assess risk more accurately and reduce costs, thereby making insurance more attractive to budget-conscious customers?

We use AI enabled self-learning models to assess risk at the time of on-boarding which curates customer provided data as well as data from other sources like IIB, Crisil and many more. This helps us detect anomalies, fraud, early claim and/or renewal propensity enabling us to take more informed and efficient underwriting decisions. On-boarding reduced risky business reduces claim rate as well as early claims thereby improving reserve ratios and enabling us to do competitive pricing. This helps in offering attractive premium rates to today’s budget conscious customers.

How is Bharti AXA Life using digital marketing, social media, or influencer-led campaigns to educate and build trust with first-time insurance buyers?

We are leveraging social media and PR in building awareness and establishing the importance of life insurance. In the past, we have leveraged a key influencer and done a series of videos which provides step-by-step guidance on why one should consider investing in life insurance and demystifying the myths around it

With the growth of fintech and insurtech ecosystems, how is Bharti AXA collaborating with digital payment platforms or fintech players to offer flexible, seamless insurance experiences tailored to the financial behavior of young Indian families?

We have partnered with multiple insurtech and fintech firms to offer very unique products and services offerings. We work with digital marketplaces like policy bazaar, fintech platforms like Airtel Payments Bank to offer our products and services through their platforms. We are also working with other digital platforms like Tata Digital to offer our products to all customers on their platform. Apart from this we continue to work on providing unique offerings on our own mobile platform – DigiServe. One of the most recent offerings rolled out on this platform is disbursal of loan against policy to customer’s bank account in less than 60 seconds for our policy holders with ZERO documentation.

In what ways has Bharti AXA Life responded to the post-COVID shift in customer expectations, especially in terms of digital onboarding, quick policy issuance, and claims processing?

COVID has been a great catalyst for our digital transformation. Currently our digital presence and service capabilities have gone far beyond fulfilling just customer expectations. We have achieved 100% digital on-boarding in FY-24 with our straight through processing clocking ~60%. We deliver 93% of our customer servicing digitally and maintain a stellar claim settlement ratio of 99.18% with 48 hours fund value guarantee and one day settlement for eligible claims through our Claim Express Service. However, our digital footprint extends further and impacts other stakeholders like we are doing 100% digital seller on-boarding, faster digital weekly commission payout, on-boarding new partners in two weeks.

Looking ahead, what role do you see emerging technologies like blockchain or embedded insurance playing in further improving access and affordability for the next generation of insurance buyers in India?

Technologies like blockchain and embedded insurance are poised to play a transformative role in making insurance more accessible and affordable for India’s next generation of buyers. Blockchain brings in transparency that can help reduce fraudulent claims, which will contribute to better pricing thereby bringing down the premiums. It can gain greater confidence in the claims process, a significant concern for young consumers who distrust traditional financial institutions. However, the application has yet to pick up speed in India.

Embedded Insurance by offering a small, contextual policy at the moment of truth is a game-changer for a generation that values convenience and is often underinsured. This model removes the traditional need for a separate insurance agent or a lengthy application process. The insurance purchase is a frictionless, opt-in option that takes seconds, aligning perfectly with the digital-first habits of young buyers. It has the potential to really derive the value of insurance in India reaching the vast, underserved population in India’s tier-2 and tier-3 cities. By partnering with popular local platforms, from fintech apps to e-commerce sites, insurers can reach a wider audience and introduce them to the concept of insurance in a familiar and trusted environment.",,N,,2025-09-10 09:10:59.925807

-- ArcelorMittalâs Phase II Expansion Marks a New Chapter

Liberia witnessed a milestone as President Joseph Nyuma Boakai joined ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal to inaugurate West Africaâs largest and most technologically advanced iron ore concentrator in Tokadeh, Nimba County.

The $1.8 billion project represents the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal Liberiaâs Phase II expansion, which quadruples annual production capacity from 5 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes. The state-of-the-art concentrator upgrades lower-grade ore into premium magnetite concentrate, boosting both output and efficiency.

âThis achievement is a testament to our long-term commitment to Liberia,â said Mr. Mittal during the ceremony. âBy increasing production fourfold, we reaffirm our belief in Liberiaâs growth, its people, and its promise.â

The expansion includes the rehabilitation of the 243-kilometer railway linking Tokadeh to the Port of Buchanan and the construction of a deep-water pier equipped with advanced ore-handling systems. These upgrades modernize Liberiaâs logistics backbone, opening new opportunities for both domestic and regional trade.

President Boakai highlighted the national impact: âThis expansion tells the world that Liberia is ready for investment, ready for jobs, ready for prosperity. Thousands of jobs have been created, and more than 1,000 permanent positions are emerging. This project proves that our economy is rising, and our people are rising with it.â

ArcelorMittal Liberia employs nearly 9,000 people, 81 percent of whom are Liberians. With Phase II operations, that figure is expected to grow further. The companyâs Advanced Vocational Training Center in Yekepa continues to produce skilled technicians and mining professionals, equipping young Liberians with the expertise needed for leadership roles in the sector.

Beyond mining operations, ArcelorMittal Liberia contributes to education, healthcare, and small-business development in host communities across Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties. Renovated schools, upgraded clinics, and support for entrepreneurs form part of a long-term strategy to ensure that growth reaches everyday citizens.

âInvesting in infrastructure and communities is just as important as our mining operations,â noted the companyâs CEO. âOur mission is to help build a stronger Liberia, creating jobs, improving public services, and leaving a legacy of sustainable growth for generations to come.â

ArcelorMittal Liberia received the award for Best Mining Company in Liberia of 2025 from Best of Best Review. The recognition highlights the companyâs leadership, sustainability efforts, and transformative role in national development.

Elias Shoniyin, CEO of ADMA, emphasized the significance of this recognition: âThe award reflects ArcelorMittal Liberiaâs contribution to job creation, infrastructure development, and economic recovery. It acknowledges the companyâs role in shaping Liberia into a competitive player in the global mining industry.â

Looking ahead, ArcelorMittal is exploring options to expand annual capacity to 30 million tonnes and develop Direct Reduction Iron (DRI)-grade concentrate, a critical input for low-carbon steelmaking. This aligns Liberia with global decarbonization efforts, positioning the country as a future supplier for green steel production.

The concentratorâs commissioning has not only reinforced Liberiaâs place in global mining but also marked a turning point in the countryâs post-conflict recovery. With billions in investment, thousands of jobs, and modernized infrastructure, Liberia is moving from being resource-rich to opportunity-rich.

ArcelorMittal Liberia, a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, the worldâs leading steel and mining company, has operated in Liberia since 2006. As the nationâs largest private-sector employer and a leading taxpayer, the company is committed to responsible mining, workforce development, and sustainable community investment.

L'Oréal, alineado con Europa Con más de 4.000 investigadores y 6.400 expertos tecnológicos y digitales en el mundo, L’Oréal Groupe quiere situarse a la vanguardia de la sostenibilidad en la industria.","L’Oréal Groupe encara la recta final de su convocatoria para captar proyectos con su Aceleradora de Innovación Sostenible. La multinacional, que ha destinado 100 millones de euros al programa durante cinco años, mantiene hasta el 30 de septiembre el plazo para que startups, pymes y empresas consolidadas presenten soluciones.

La compañía busca impulsar la transición de la industria de la cosmética hacia un modelo más sostenible, bajo en carbono y respetuoso con la biodiversidad, al tiempo que fomenta la colaboración con el ecosistema emprendedor.

""Buscamos acelerar nuestra transformación para cumplir con nuestros ambiciosos objetivos de 2030; reinventar la experiencia de belleza a través de la Beauty Tech; y mantenernos a la vanguardia, con tecnologías que nos permitan seguir siendo líderes y definir el futuro del sector"", explica Juan Alonso de Lomas, CEO de L’Oréal España, a Invertia.

La Aceleradora de Innovación Sostenible se desarrolla en colaboración con el Instituto de Liderazgo en Sostenibilidad de la Universidad de Cambridge (CISL), que aportará su red internacional de expertos y su experiencia en desarrollo empresarial sostenible para acelerar la llegada al mercado de las soluciones más prometedoras.

El ecosistema nacional, con potencial

Juan Alonso de Lomas subraya que España cuenta con los ingredientes para convertirse en un actor clave: “Un talento científico y técnico de primer nivel, excelentes universidades y centros de investigación, y una creciente especialización en áreas como biotecnología, energías renovables, circularidad y digitalización"".

En este sentido, el grupo asegura que a lo largo de esta convocatoria espera encontrar proyectos y talento que ayuden a liderar el cambio en ámbitos como el desarrollo de nuevos ingredientes, soluciones para la gestión del agua o las denominadas green sciences (ciencias verdes).

Este último término resume un cambio radical en la investigación cosmética: implica reemplazar o complementar los procesos químicos tradicionales con fórmulas inspiradas en la naturaleza, con bajo impacto ambiental y alta eficiencia.

""España puede tener un papel protagonista en esta aceleradora”, añade el directivo. El objetivo de la misma no es solo económico, sino estratégico: ""El retorno que buscamos es la capacidad de cocrear el futuro de la belleza para que L'Oréal Groupe siga siendo tan relevante y pionero en los próximos cien años como lo ha sido hasta ahora"".

Entre los casos de éxito previos, L’Oréal ya ha colaborado con startups como Gjosa, creadora de un cabezal de ducha capaz de reducir hasta un 69% el consumo de agua, o ModiFace, especializada en herramientas de prueba virtual de maquillaje y coloración capilar.

Ambas iniciativas combinan sostenibilidad y tecnología para reinventar la experiencia del consumidor y reducir el impacto ambiental del sector.

Tecnologías para la belleza del futuro

La aceleradora forma parte del plan L’Oréal for the Future, que persigue integrar la sostenibilidad en toda la cadena de valor: desde los ingredientes hasta el packaging, desde la producción hasta las formas de consumo.

El grupo ya está trabajando en soluciones disruptivas que combinan ciencia, tecnología y naturaleza.

El titán del beauty galo colabora con empresas biotecnológicas como Debut, con sede en Estados Unidos, para desarrollar ingredientes bioidénticos esenciales que permitirán crear productos con menor impacto.

A nivel local, con la española Presto Ibérica ha creado un sensor que permite graduar la temperatura del agua para promover un uso más inteligente y eficiente de la misma.

Paralelamente, L'Oréal está volcada en innovaciones como los BioPods, jardines verticales controlados por inteligencia artificial que permiten cultivar ingredientes durante todo el año.

Estos replican las condiciones climáticas óptimas para cada especie vegetal, maximizando la producción de principios activos y reduciendo la presión sobre los ecosistemas naturales.

Otro proyecto expuesto en Le Visionnaire —sede ubicada en París en la que el grupo dio a conocer sus últimos avances en materia de sostenibilidad este verano— es Osmobloom.

Creado con Cosmo International Fragrances, el sistema permite capturar las moléculas aromáticas de las flores sin dañarlas, abriendo la puerta a fragancias más auténticas, éticas y sostenibles.

Un ecosistema en transformación

La aceleradora de L’Oréal Groupe no solo busca financiar proyectos, sino también crear un ecosistema global de innovación sostenible.

El programa incluye un acompañamiento de hasta 12 meses con expertos del CISL y de L’Oréal para que las startups puedan validar sus soluciones, medir su impacto y escalar su modelo de negocio a nivel internacional. Las áreas en las que pueden inscribirse los interesados son amplias:

Soluciones con bajo impacto de carbono y adaptadas al cambio climático

Resiliencia hídrica

Propuestas basadas en la naturaleza, ingredientes y materiales alternativos

Eliminación del uso de plásticos fósiles y de residuos plásticos

Circularidad y gestión de recursos

Modelos de negocio sostenibles e inclusivos

Este enfoque es paralelo a una demanda creciente de los consumidores. Según datos internos de L’Oréal, el 78% de los usuarios quiere productos más sostenibles, pero muchos no saben cómo integrarlos en su rutina.

La compañía ve en la tecnología a una vía para cerrar esa brecha y ofrecer soluciones que combinen eficacia, transparencia y respeto por el medioambiente. Y, en esta hoja de ruta, las startups son un pilar fundamental.

En palabras del director ejecutivo para España y Portugal, ""tenemos un fuerte compromiso con el modelo de investigación y la innovación 'abierta', y las vemos como socias estratégicas que nos aportan agilidad, disrupción y perspectivas frescas, elementos cruciales en el dinámico sector de la belleza"".

L'Oréal, alineado con Europa

Con más de 4.000 investigadores y 6.400 expertos tecnológicos y digitales en el mundo, L’Oréal Groupe quiere situarse a la vanguardia de la sostenibilidad en la industria.

Sus objetivos se alinean con el Pacto Verde Europeo, con metas concretas como reducir en un 57% las emisiones directas para 2030 y lograr que todos sus centros en Europa funcionen con energía 100% renovable.

Además, la multinacional ha lanzado iniciativas para reducir la huella digital de su publicidad y fomentar modelos de negocio circulares, como el #JoinTheRefillMovement, que promueve la recarga de perfumes, cremas y champús para reducir el uso de envases de un solo uso.

Ante la urgencia climática actual, ""nos estamos quedando sin tiempo, necesitamos acelerar"", subrayan desde la compañía, convencidos de que la colaboración con el ecosistema emprendedor será clave para alcanzar estos ambiciosos objetivos.

La primera convocatoria de la aceleradora se cierra en pocas semanas, pero L'Oréal Groupe espera que sea solo el comienzo de una nueva etapa de alianzas entre la gran industria y las startups.",https://s2.elespanol.com/2025/09/07/actualidad/1003743915064_258516684_1706x960.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:30.931546

For H&M Group, the Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding represents both a defensive maneuver and an offensive strategy to reclaim relevance in a fragmented market. By blending cutting-edge product innovation with a recalibrated sustainability narrative, the Swedish retailer is attempting to redefine its value proposition in an era where ethical consumption and design excellence are no longer optional but expected.

Product Innovation and Rebranding: Bridging Fast Fashion and High-End Appeal

H&M's Fall/Winter 2025 collection introduces technologies such as HEATTECH, PUFFTECH, and AIRism, which aim to merge functionality with style. These innovations—designed to regulate temperature, enhance insulation, and improve breathability—signal a departure from the brand's traditional fast-fashion identity, positioning it as a purveyor of value-driven technical apparelH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. Complementing this is the appointment of Glenn Martens as creative collaborator for AW25, a move that injects high-fashion credibility into the brand's offerings. Martens' collaboration, coupled with the launch of an elevated ""Atelier"" collection for men and the phasing out of virgin down by 2025, underscores H&M's ambition to attract consumers seeking both quality and sustainabilityH&M - FashionNetwork.com Worldwide[ 5 ].

The rebranding also includes a physical and digital overhaul. Plans to renovate 250 stores and deploy pop-up activations in key markets aim to create immersive shopping experiences, while RFID technology and a redesigned website will streamline inventory management and customer engagementH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. These efforts align with broader industry trends emphasizing omnichannel integration, as highlighted in Fast Fashion Trends 2025Fast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ].

Sustainability Strategies: Progress, Paradoxes, and Public Skepticism

H&M's sustainability roadmap for 2025 includes a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2040H&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. The company has also increased the share of recycled materials in its products to 29.5% in 2024, nearing its 30% targetH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 6 ]. Initiatives like agrivoltaics in Bangladesh and AI-powered garment sorting systems further demonstrate its commitment to circularityH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. However, these efforts are shadowed by persistent allegations of greenwashing. Critics argue that H&M's ""Conscious"" collections and environmental scorecards have historically overstated sustainability benefits while failing to address systemic issues like labor rights and the environmental toll of its fast-fashion modelFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ].

The tension between H&M's aspirational goals and its operational reality is stark. While the brand has localized production to reduce emissions and improve responsivenessH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ], its reliance on low-cost, high-volume manufacturing remains at odds with long-term sustainability. As noted in How Ethical Is H&M?, the company has yet to ensure living wages across its supply chainFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ]. This duality risks eroding consumer trust, particularly among Gen Z and Millennial shoppers who prioritize authenticityH&M - FashionNetwork.com Worldwide[ 5 ].

Financial Performance and Market Position: A Delicate Balancing Act

H&M's financials reflect both resilience and vulnerability. For FY24, the company reported a 10% sales growth and a 12% increase in operating profitH&M Group Reports Sustainability Progress in Retail Operations 2024[ 3 ]. However, Q1 2025 results revealed a 37% year-over-year decline in operating profit to SEK 1.2 billion, attributed to markdowns and supply chain disruptionsH&M Trend Dresses: Balancing Fast Fashion & ...[ 7 ]. Inventory levels rose by 9%, signaling overstocking challengesH&M Trend Dresses: Balancing Fast Fashion & ...[ 7 ]. These figures highlight the difficulty of transitioning from a volume-driven model to one prioritizing profitability and sustainability.

The Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding is positioned as a solution to this dilemma. By emphasizing premium price points (e.g., $200 faux-fur coats alongside $15 basics) and reducing reliance on discounts, H&M aims to stabilize margins while appealing to a broader demographicH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ]. Yet, analysts caution that the ""middle market"" strategy—sandwiched between luxury aspirants and ultra-fast fashion—is inherently precarious. As Business of Fashion notes, H&M must convince consumers that its offerings are both aspirational and affordable, a tightrope walk in an era of polarized spending habitsH&M's Big Bet on Fashion's Elusive Middle[ 1 ].

Expert Analysis: Risks and Opportunities in a Transformed Sector

Third-party evaluations of H&M's rebranding efforts underscore a mix of optimism and skepticism. On one hand, the brand's investment in circularity—such as its Pre-Loved secondhand platform and Lab innovation hub—aligns with growing demand for sustainable consumptionFast Fashion Trends 2025: Key Shifts & Insights[ 2 ]. On the other, the Business of Fashion's 2022 Sustainability Index gave H&M a score of 28/100, citing insufficient transparency in addressing environmental and social challenges2nd Edition of Business of Fashion's Sustainability Index[ 8 ]. This gap between ambition and execution could hinder long-term growth.

Moreover, H&M's new CEO, Daniel Ervér, faces the daunting task of reconciling profitability with sustainability. His focus on a 10% operating margin target and store network optimizationPREVIEW H&M's new boss Erver faces battle to reboot sales[ 4 ] suggests a pragmatic approach, but the success of these strategies will depend on execution.

Conclusion: A Catalyst for Growth or a Fleeting Revival?

H&M's Fall/Winter 2025 rebranding encapsulates the broader challenges facing the retail sector: how to innovate without compromising ethics, how to compete in a polarized market, and how to align with consumer values without falling into performative sustainability. While the company's technological advancements and design collaborations offer a compelling value proposition, its ability to sustain growth will hinge on addressing systemic issues in its supply chain and business model.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 10:12:54.708717

The $46 billion union that once represented a grand vision for the food industry is now being dismantled, leaving investors to question whether this represents a strategic masterstroke or an admission of fundamental failure.

Market Reaction and Historical Context

The announcement sent Kraft Heinz shares tumbling 6.4% in Tuesday's trading session, marking the most significant single-day decline since May 2022. This unanimous board decision effectively dismantles the original vision championed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital, proposing a tax-free separation of the business into distinct entities.

The move comes against a troubling backdrop: Kraft Heinz stock has lost approximately 60% of its value since the 2015 merger, with the company continuing to struggle against declining sales and substantial debt burdens. The separation now appears designed to salvage value where consolidation ultimately failed to deliver.

The New Corporate Structure

Under the proposed split, two distinct companies will emerge with clearly defined portfolios. The first entity, temporarily designated ""Global Taste Elevation Co.,"" will incorporate the faster-growing international brands including Heinz Ketchup, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. This division generated $15.4 billion in 2024 revenue, with emerging markets contributing 20% of its sales, positioning it as the growth engine of the separation.

The second company, ""North American Grocery Co.,"" will focus on traditional U.S. household brands including Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables. Despite generating $10.4 billion in annual revenue, this segment is viewed as having limited growth potential—a primary source of investor skepticism regarding the separation.

Divergent Analyst Perspectives

Wall Street analysts have expressed conflicting views on the strategic move. Morgan Stanley surprisingly upgraded Kraft Heinz from ""underweight"" to ""equal weight"" while raising its price target to $29. Analyst Megan Alexander suggested the negative thesis had ""largely played out"" and that current estimates appeared ""more realistic.""

In contrast, Mizuho analyst John Baumgartner maintained a cautious stance, noting that while the separation might establish a ""floor under the stock,"" fundamental growth concerns would likely constrain significant upside potential.

Execution Challenges and Timeline

The corporate divorce carries substantial financial implications, including approximately $300 million in annual additional costs resulting from lost synergies. The separation also represents one of the most significant corporate splits in recent memory, introducing considerable execution risk during the transition period.

The transaction is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2026, providing ample time for further market volatility as details emerge. Whether this radical move will ultimately create two stronger competitors or simply formalize the breakdown of a failed vision remains uncertain.

Price rollbacks have helped Walmart maintain its shopper value proposition, with the number of rollbacks in grocery, for example, up 30% versus a year earlier.
“Hopefully, things get settled sooner rather than later and at lower rates than what’s being discussed right now.
And we have to be thoughtful about things like higher price points.
If you pass on the entire impact of a tariff at a higher price point, it can put it out a range, and you really see a unit decline.","NEW YORK — Expect consumers to feel pressured through the rest of this year – and maybe into next year – as tariffs fuel an inflationary environment and stir shopper uncertainty, Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer of Walmart, told the investment community at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference.

“If you look at the middle to upper income levels, we’re seeing strong demand, and if you look at middle to lower, there has been a little bit of stress,” McMillon said in a fireside chat at the investor event in New York. “We’ve seen behavioral change on items that have gone up in cost because of tariffs, where they’re switching from one item to the other – some of the behavioral stuff that you always see during times of pressure.”

When reporting fiscal 2026 second-quarter results two weeks ago, Walmart executives described consumers as hard-pressed but exhibiting consistent shopping behavior, with no pronounced shifts thus far in response to tariffs.

“Generally speaking, people have held up really well, and we expect the same thing to happen for the balance of the year,” McMillon said at the conference. “This quarter started off in the same strong fashion on the top line, so we’re continuing to see what happened in the second quarter spill into the third quarter.”

Walmart US second-quarter net sales climbed 4.8% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the grocery and health-and-wellness categories plus a 26% jump in e-commerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel gained 4.6%, aided by upticks in average ticket size and transaction count. Price rollbacks have helped Walmart maintain its shopper value proposition, with the number of rollbacks in grocery, for example, up 30% versus a year earlier.

“US inflation is low single digits; that doesn’t tell the whole story,” McMillon explained to investors. “If you look at what’s happened in the food categories, particularly prepared foods, processed foods, dry grocery, stuff like that, we’ve seen prices go up for multiple years now. So absolute pricing levels in food are higher than we want them to be and higher than what American families would want it to be.

“And then on the general merchandise side, we saw prices go up as supply chains got stretched after the pandemic, and then GM (general merchandise) prices came down. What’s happened more recently – because of what’s happening with tariffs – is we’ve seen a steady march up, kind of a gradual increase, as it relates to our cost levels in general merchandise, which has created the single-digit inflation that we find ourselves dealing with now.”

Price elasticity has been “better than I thought” in the current consumer environment, according to McMillon.

“When items go up, we see units go down in some corresponding fashion as people switch to other items,” he said. “Customers are really smart and rational, and they move from one item to another from one category to another as they see prices change.”

Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2026, Walmart lifted its adjusted earnings-per-share estimates at the bottom and top ends by 2¢, to between $2.52 and $2.62. Its net sales growth forecast was raised by three-quarters of a percentage point at both ends, to between 3.75% and 4.75%.

“For the balance of the year, we would say it’s the same, and I think next year we’ll see this cost pressure that’s flowing through the system play out over time,” McMillon said. “So far, it has been gradual and, therefore, the impact has been somewhat muted. So, it’s not a situation where I can tell you when things are going to be different. And in fact, if they are, I think consistency is the answer.”

Tariffs will tell much of the tale in terms of the elasticity response to pricing actions, McMillon said. Less than a third of what Walmart sells in the United States is imported, with China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada being the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer’s biggest markets.

“It depends on the tariff level, of course, and what happens with countries like India,” he said. “Hopefully, things get settled sooner rather than later and at lower rates than what’s being discussed right now. We’d like a quick resolution and overall lower rates. Customers are going to be rational. And we have to be thoughtful about things like higher price points. If you pass on the entire impact of a tariff at a higher price point, it can put it out a range, and you really see a unit decline. So, we do things like spread within categories and across categories within GM to help manage that, trying to protect food prices and keep some separation there.”",https://www.meatpoultry.com/ext/resources/2025/09/09/Walmart-Lead_adst_Sundry-Photography.jpg?height=635&t=1757436288&width=1200,N,,2025-09-10 09:12:05.262880

The retailer noted the action at its first Growth Summit in Sub-Saharan Africa in April.

The event featured suppliers from 12 African countries with innovations and products that are made, grown, or assembled in Africa. Walmart said the event resulted in the recruitment of small- to medium-sized African-based suppliers.

“Walmart’s South African stores will offer a wide range of merchandise, including fresh groceries, household essentials, apparel and technology,” said Kath McLay, CEO of Walmart International. “Walmart will also offer a variety of locally sourced products. By partnering with South African suppliers and entrepreneurs, Walmart will bring its signature Every Day Low Prices and global standards to the market, while celebrating the country’s rich culture.”

With sites already in development, Walmart said the new stores are set to open before the end of the year. The official opening dates and location details will be released in October. Walmart said its business in South Africa will include online commerce.

Walmart acquired a 51% interest in Massmart in 2011 for $2.3 billion. But in August 2023, Walmart purchased the outstanding shares for $377.6 million, giving it full ownership over the business. Civil unrest throughout areas of Africa and a volatile economic climate over the years had Walmart re-evaluate its business interests on the continent in 2019. Several management changes and a slow build-out for stores in underserved countries ensued.

Walmart brought in new Massmart management in March, with Miles Van Rensburg becoming CEO, the fourth CEO in six years. Massmart announced in June three more executive changes for its Makro, Game, and Cash & Carry businesses.

Walmart/Massmart owns and operates 302 retail units in Africa under the Builders, Cambridge, Cash & Carry, Jumbo, Makro and Rhino store banners. Builders is based in South Africa and is a home improvement and materials company that operates warehouses, express and superstore formats at 120 locations.

Game is a discount retailer that focuses on appliances, electronics, lifestyle merchandise, groceries, liquor and some services. There are 113 Game stores in Africa, 100 of which are in South Africa. The Makro stores are similar to a Sam’s Club format, selling food, liquor and general merchandise to retail and wholesale customers. There are 23 Makro locations, all of which are in South Africa.

There are 37 Cash & Carry stores in the country, 27 in South Africa with other locations in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zambia. Like Makro, the Cash & Carry format sells food and general merchandise for commercial and wholesale customers.

Fifth Third Bank said Tuesday that the Treasury Department's Bureau of Fiscal Service has designated the Cincinnati-based lender as the next financial agent for the U.S. government's Direct Express prepaid debit card program.

The decision marks a reversal from last November, when the Fiscal Service Bureau said that it had selected The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. as the program's financial agent.

A BNY spokesperson said in an email late Tuesday that the New York-based bank was selected in November 2024 ""along with a group of additional new service providers,"" and that the Fiscal Service Bureau ""made the decision to discontinue the agreement"" as a result of ""readiness challenges involving one of the providers.""

Fifth Third and the Treasury Department did not provide additional comment on the demise of the BNY agreement.

Fifth Third said in a press release that it has reached a five-year agreement with the Fiscal Service Bureau, and that the agreement started on Tuesday. The bureau's earlier agreement with BNY was also for five years, according to a November 2024 press release, and had been scheduled to start on Jan. 3, 2025.

As of Tuesday evening, the Fiscal Service Bureau had not posted a new press release to its website. But Fifth Third's own release included a quote from the bureau's commissioner, Tim Gribben.

""Direct Express plays a critical role in delivering federal benefits payments electronically, especially lifeline payments such as Social Security and Veterans benefits,"" Gribben said in Fifth Third's release.

Gribben, who previously worked at the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Small Business Administration, was appointed commissioner of the Fiscal Service Bureau in May 2019, according to the bureau's website.

Fifth Third said in its release that the Fiscal Service Bureau ""determined that Fifth Third has the vision and capability to expand the Direct Express program over the five-year term to deliver compelling mobile applications and digital options designed to provide frictionless value for millions of debit card recipients.""

""This transition marks a step forward in the Fiscal Service's mission to provide a modern, seamless and secure payment experience for federal benefit recipients,"" Fifth Third said.

The Direct Express program provides prepaid debit cards that enable roughly 3.4 million Americans, most of whom do not have a bank account, to receive monthly federal benefits, according to Fifth Third.

The banking unit of the $210 billion-asset Fifth Third Bancorp said in its release that it plans to ""offer recipients more freedom and convenience to access federal benefits with new or enhanced solutions such as virtual cards, cardless ATM access, rent and other bill payment services, digital wallet integration and more.""

""We're focused on delivering secure, high-quality financial services that make banking more accessible for millions of Americans,"" said Bridgit Chayt, head of commercial payments at Fifth Third, in the release.

Fifth Third also said that Money Network Financial, LLC, will serve as Direct Express' program manager, and that the program will continue to run on Mastercard's network, as it has since 2008.

The Direct Express program faced problems under its previous financial agent, Comerica Bank. Dallas-based Comerica faced allegations that it shared sensitive consumer data with vendors and failed to reimburse government beneficiaries who claimed their benefits had been stolen due to fraud.

Also on Tuesday, Fifth Third disclosed that it recently discovered what it characterized as ""alleged fraudulent activity"" in connection with a commercial borrower's asset-backed finance loan, saying that it expects to take a non-cash impairment charge of $170 million-$200 million in the third quarter.

The loan in question has an unpaid principal balance of roughly $200 million, Fifth Third said in a securities filing. The bank added that it ""is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/624cda0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2Fd0%2F75d1facf42e1bdcb31ef56282a80%2F397528604.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:11:18.480294

Zipline, a San Francisco-based robotics company that designs, manufactures, and operates what it says is the world’s largest autonomous delivery system, has launched service for customers who live near the Walmart Supercenter at 7401 Samuell Blvd., just south of U.S. Highway 80. Shoppers in the area can now get up to 5.5 pounds of goods delivered in minutes by drone.

More than 65,000 items from the store are eligible for delivery in under 20 minutes, the company said. That includes fresh and frozen food, pantry staples, and essentials like baby formula.

UnitedHealth expects to have roughly 78% of its Medicare Advantage enrollees in plans rated four stars or above next year, the healthcare behemoth disclosed Tuesday in a securities filing.

The percentage of members in the high-performing plans — which yield valuable bonuses — has stayed largely flat compared to 2025, according to analysts. But it’s still a positive development for UnitedHealth, and a good sign for other managed care companies in MA, many of which have struggled to reach stricter star ratings thresholds.

UnitedHealth’s stock rose roughly 9% over Tuesday’s trade following the disclosure, which also shared that the company plans to reaffirm its 2025 financial guidance in upcoming investor meetings.

Dive Insight:

The CMS rates MA plans from one to five stars based on a complex calculation of metrics that, overall, are meant to represent plan quality. Insurers jockey fiercely for higher ratings, which help their plans stand out for seniors shopping for privatized Medicare coverage — and translate directly to higher revenue from the government.

As such, insurers were generally unhappy with tweaks to star ratings methodology that tamped down on average scores for 2025, including by making it harder to reach the vaunted four-star cutoff. (Plans that receive an overall rating of four or higher receive higher bonus payments, and higher scores also result in larger rebates if plans submit bids below the CMS’ benchmark for the coming year.)

With billions of dollars in payments at stake, multiple insurers sued the government to get their ratings recalculated, with mixed results. And executives and investors in the industry have been waiting anxiously for signs of how the quality scores could come down for 2026. The CMS officially releases stars for the upcoming plan year in October, but allows plans to take a first look at their data. Payers’ second window to check out their preliminary results opened on Tuesday, and UnitedHealth is electing to share its early results with investors.

Having more than three-fourths of its more than 8 million MA members in plans with at least four stars is “consistent with our expectations and in line with historical performance,” UnitedHealth wrote in its securities filing.

Still, the results are better than some investors feared, especially amid concerns that thresholds to reach four stars could increase further for 2026.

“Our biggest takeaway is that we aren’t seeing a material upward shift in stars similar to last year,” J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note Tuesday.

Major health insurers are currently hustling to boost margins in their MA businesses, as higher medical utilization among seniors and unfavorable policy changes cut into once-comfortable profits.

With an eye toward improving margins, payers — including UnitedHealth’s insurance division UnitedHealthcare — are culling unprofitable plans for next year. UnitedHealthcare expects to lose some 600,000 enrollees as a result of the plan exits.

Despite higher MA rates coming down the pike, where star ratings land is another major swing factor for insurers’ margin recovery plans — especially for insurers that have room for improvement in their scores.

Humana, the second-largest MA insurer after UnitedHealthcare, said during a second-quarter call with investors that it expects its star ratings to improve for 2026, though the company doesn’t plan to discuss its results until stars are officially released in October.

Elevance also said it wouldn’t explicitly comment on stars during an investor conference last week, though CFO Mark Kaye said the company was encouraged by its progress. Centene has also said it expects its stars to improve next year.

UnitedHealth, Humana, Elevance, Centene and CVS, the parent company of insurer Aetna, did not respond to a request for comment for this story by time of publication.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gp7-9yDSiCZQoGHBzNxfophsasMnSZtZnJ8p0ayp8-U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS91bml0ZWRfaGVhbHRoX2dyb3VwLmpwZWc=.webp,N,,2025-09-09 21:07:23.776192

Which is what Ralph Lauren has done with its latest AI element, with Microsoft’s AI tools powering a new product matching tool that can help users style their looks, based on Ralph Lauren items.
But then again, depending on exactly how it determines product matches, maybe you’ll just end up looking more like a Ralph Lauren model, as opposed to having any individual style.
In terms of specifics, Microsoft doesn’t provide a heap of insight into how the system determines relevant matches, only noting that: “Ask Ralph delivers tailored responses to a user’s prompts, curating outfits and looks from across the Polo Ralph Lauren brand, with all items suggested from available inventory.
Like showing you related products based on your specific query, like giving you a full listing of products you’ll need for a specific project, matching images to items, people to process, etc.","With AI tools playing a growing role in product discovery, it makes sense for brands to explore new opportunities on this front, which can utilize the strengths of AI to enhance the shopping experience.

Which is what Ralph Lauren has done with its latest AI element, with Microsoft’s AI tools powering a new product matching tool that can help users style their looks, based on Ralph Lauren items.

As explained by Microsoft:

“Ask Ralph is a conversational AI shopping experience built on Azure OpenAI, and available in the Ralph Lauren app in the U.S. You can interact with Ask Ralph just like you would a stylist in a Ralph Lauren store by asking simple, conversational questions or using prompts to find the perfect look for any occasion.”

So if you want to know what goes best with a pair of shoes that you like, or a specific color of shirt, “Ask Ralph” will be able to give you styling notes, based on commonly purchased items, curated looks, what other people have searched for in relation to each item, etc.

Which is kind of personalized, I guess, in that it’s an open prompt, and you can direct how it finds related products. But then again, depending on exactly how it determines product matches, maybe you’ll just end up looking more like a Ralph Lauren model, as opposed to having any individual style.

Though the market demand for that would be high either way, as a lot of people simply want to look their best, and are seeking guidance on how to do that.

In terms of specifics, Microsoft doesn’t provide a heap of insight into how the system determines relevant matches, only noting that:

“Ask Ralph delivers tailored responses to a user’s prompts, curating outfits and looks from across the Polo Ralph Lauren brand, with all items suggested from available inventory. Ask Ralph can also interpret tone, satisfaction, and intent to refine recommendations dynamically. It also adapts to contextual cues like location-based insights or event-driven needs.”

So there’s not a lot of info on how, exactly, the tool decides what fits best with each other item, but presumably, it’s being guided by the factors noted above.

And again, this is what AI is good for, cross-matching large datasets to find commonalities and correlations that are beyond the capacity of other systems. The capacity to translate natural language searches into complex queries for such purpose is a huge benefit, and there are a range of ways that this could help to streamline and improve various actions that relate to such functions.

On Tuesday, Albertsons released a list of 12 stores in Colorado and New Mexico that will close as part of a “strategic consolidation.” One store in Nebraska is also on the list.

“As part of our ongoing commitment to operational excellence and customer-focused innovation, we’ve recently unified the Intermountain and Denver divisions into the newly formed Mountain West Division. This strategic consolidation is more than a structural change – it’s a growth accelerator,” said Heather Halpape, director of communications and public affairs for the Mountain West Division.

Alamosa Citizen reached out to verify that the Alamosa and Monte Vista Safeway stores would remain open. “Yes, these stores in Alamosa and Monte Vista will remain open,” Halpape said.

“We continuously evaluate the performance of our stores, and occasionally, after long and careful deliberation, it becomes necessary to make the difficult decision to close certain locations,” she said of the stores on the closure list.

The Alamosa Safeway store was on a list of stores to be sold under an earlier merger effort between Kroger Co. and Albertsons.

Roughly $27 million will go to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days.","OKLAHOMA CITY — A $32 million settlement has been reached with CVS Caremark following accusations that the company kept money that belonged to Oklahoma’s state employee health plan.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond shared on Tuesday that a settlement had been reached.

“When a company keeps money that belongs to Oklahoma taxpayers, we’re going to fight to get it back,” said Attorney General Drummond. “This settlement ensures that millions of dollars go where they should have gone all along — to benefit our state employees’ healthcare.”

CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager that handles prescription drug benefits for health plans, such as Oklahoma’s state employee plan HealthChoice.

Typically, CVS Caremark passes the money from medication discounts and rebates to HealthChoice. However, according to the State of Oklahoma, CVS was accused of having kept millions of dollars from January 2020 through December 2024. The company denied those claims.

The settlement agreement reached between the state and CVS Caremark requires the company to pay $32.1 million to the State of Oklahoma. Roughly $27 million will go to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days.

“This settlement ensures millions of dollars will be directed back to the HealthChoice plan, benefitting Oklahoma’s state employees and their families,” said Ellen Buettner, CEO of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA). “This recovery underscores OHCA’s commitment to maximizing the value of healthcare benefits for those who serve our state.”

CVS Caremark will also be required to pay any additional rebate amounts from the 2020-2024 period within 90 days, pass all future rebate payments directly to the HealthChoice plan within 90 days of collection, and agree to a broader definition of ‘rebate’ in the state contract.

None of the money collected for the HealthChoice plan will stay with the Attorney General’s Office. All the funds will go back to the state plan.

“These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,” said Drummond. “This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.”

CVS Caremark denied all accusations but has agreed to the settlement agreement to avoid any further uncertainties in litigation.",https://cmg-cmg-rd-20111-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com%2Fcmg%2FXIQMXHL7D5FMTFHRSGECUUFZT4.jpg?auth=433dd850ae69ec7722e11855859ba13ab37e8f306a427910958c634ffc7bce5c&width=1200&height=630&smart=true,N,,2025-09-10 08:06:14.104432

ID42,Walmart,2025-09-09 21:24:08+00:00,Modern Retail,Walmart's first new stores in years face local resistance - Modern Retail,Mitchell Parton,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/operations/walmarts-first-new-stores-in-years-face-local-resistance/,"For example, in Ankeny, Iowa, residents have been speaking out this year against a Walmart store proposed near their homes at the end of 2024, NBC affiliate WHO 13 Des Moines reported.
Others claimed the store could hurt home values, though a 2012 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research instead found new Walmart stores actually would increase housing prices by up to 3%.
She added that developers may also include public parks or playgrounds to give communities a benefit for approving big projects.
For example, the planning commission in Columbia, Tennessee approved construction of a 45,000-square-foot Walmart store.
Changing perceptions Still, Walmart is seeking local approvals in a different environment than it operated in 10 or 15 years ago.","Companies that want to build big-box stores have to secure certain approvals or permits; that has often brought Walmart, its developers or attorneys to public meetings to hear feedback from neighboring residents.

While in some cases, the retailer has flown through easily, elsewhere it has encountered opposition from some community members. For example, in Ankeny, Iowa, residents have been speaking out this year against a Walmart store proposed near their homes at the end of 2024, NBC affiliate WHO 13 Des Moines reported. Residents complained about increased traffic on main and side roads, increased noise and light pollution. In June, the planning commission of Edmond, Oklahoma, denied plans for a 44,000-square-foot Walmart Neighborhood Market grocery store — nearly 100 residents had attended a public meeting to voice concerns.

Still, a Walmart spokesperson told Modern Retail its three newest stores that opened over the last few months in Cypress, Texas; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Eagle Mountain, Utah have been celebrated by their respective communities and have attracted crowds of people.

“We are always looking for opportunities to grow and better serve local communities, and we will continue to explore ways to meet the needs of our customers,” the spokesperson said.

In the past, criticism against Walmart has largely centered around how the company treats its employees. From 2012 to 2014, OUR Walmart (Organization United for Respect at Walmart) and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union organized employee walkouts throughout the country, seeking better wages and working conditions for Walmart workers. In 2015, workers in dozens of cities joined the “Fight for $15” movement, walking out and protesting to raise the federal minimum wage.

However, many of the more recent concerns are those often expressed by residents in rural communities or exurbs opposing any new construction near their homes — not anything specific to how Walmart conducts its business.

“I think it applies to any kind of development or project in the community. Even if you’re in a big city or a small town, I think the issues are the same; the neighbors take an interest in what’s going to happen,” said Alice Jump, a partner for law firm Reavis Page Jump LLP in New York City. “I find that most people don’t want change. If they’re happy with their neighborhood, they don’t want something that’s going to change it.”

Mixed reception from neighbors

Comments from neighbors can often range from legitimate concerns to those that are far-flung from reality, Jump said, adding that some will even try to promote conspiracy theories or simply get attention. It’s just part of meeting the public, she noted.

Some in the Iowa town said building a Walmart Supercenter would harm their community’s residential character. Others claimed the store could hurt home values, though a 2012 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research instead found new Walmart stores actually would increase housing prices by up to 3%. In May, the city said the zoning application was still on hold to conduct a traffic survey, according to the NBC affiliate, and the current status remains unclear. Walmart has not broken ground on this project, according to a spokesperson.

“Our community is a peaceful residential area, crafted through years of planning and love. We consciously chose to build and buy in this bedroom community, cherishing the quiet and safe environment,” one nearby resident Clint Rocker wrote in a Change.org petition signed by almost 1,800 people. “The recent proposal to rezone our neighborhood for commercial purposes … threatens our cherished tranquility.”

Another Ankeny resident, Trevor Meeks, said, “If you introduce a big-box retailer right in the middle of a residential area like this, it’s going to create new noise pollution, new light pollution,” per WHO 13. “It’s going to be a lot of trash blowing around. It’s going to create a very large new traffic load.”

In Oklahoma, similar to those in Iowa, Edmond residents wanted to preserve property values, prevent an increase in traffic, and protect the plants and animals on the site. Members of the planning commission raised issues of the architectural compatibility of the proposed Walmart with surrounding structures, according to nonprofit news outlet NonDoc.

During the meeting, NonDoc reported, an attorney for the developers argued that the project met all code requirements and that his client would work with city staff to meet or exceed all city codes related to preservation of nature and lighting.

“What more can a property owner or developer do, other than comply with the rules as prescribed by the city?” the attorney, David Box, asked. “There’s nothing more they can do. To put additional requirements would be absolutely subjective and violate every principle of development and every principle of legal authority that exists for the State of Oklahoma.”

In St. Johns County, Florida, near Jacksonville, some residents in December expressed concerns about adding more development — including a Walmart Supercenter — near a Buc-ee’s travel center and Interstate 95 due to traffic, NBC affiliate First Coast News reported.

“There’s people that don’t even live in this area that already talk bad about how bad it is driving here,” one resident, Cindy Chong, told the broadcaster.

According to First Coast News, entitlements had already been granted in 2003, and the county attorney said nothing could be done to stop the development, though the store itself had yet to be approved. Walmart has not broken ground in St. Johns Country, per a spokesperson.

Jump said that for retailers or developers, bringing in senior executives can help corporations not come off as corporate behemoths and diffuse these sorts of situations. She added that developers may also include public parks or playgrounds to give communities a benefit for approving big projects.

“What developers have to do is prepare the groundwork: Go in with knowledge of the players, in terms of who the people are on the zoning board, or whatever structure there is in the particular area, who have to review or approve it, and maybe engage with with community leaders before there’s any kind of official legal action to be taken,” Jump said. “It’s almost a PR process as much as a legal process. Explain the benefits, maybe diffuse the criticism by being empathetic to what the community is concerned about and addressing that.”

Not all communities have been combative toward Walmart.

For example, the planning commission in Columbia, Tennessee approved construction of a 45,000-square-foot Walmart store. Columbia Vice Mayor Randy McBroom praised the design in a public meeting, according to the Columbia Daily Herald.

“I appreciate the way it looks, because it doesn’t look like a Walmart, but more like a medical building,” McBroom said.

Changing perceptions

Still, Walmart is seeking local approvals in a different environment than it operated in 10 or 15 years ago. The big-box giant has worked to improve its image, both in terms of how it pays employees and the aesthetic of its stores, as well as its brand equity among higher-income shoppers.

“A lot of more affluent shoppers relied on Walmart for e-commerce grocery delivery during the pandemic and have since discovered that Walmart’s not a terrible place to shop,” said Bryan Gildenberg, founder and CEO of Confluencer Commerce, adding that it helps that the company has made its stores — as he describes — more aesthetically pleasing. “As a result, you don’t have the visceral reaction to a Walmart coming that you might if you walked into a Walmart store 30 years ago and found it to be a little bare-bones and underkept for your taste.”

Anne Mezzenga, co-CEO of Omni Talk and a former marketing leader at Target, added that the investments Walmart has made in supply chain infrastructure, store redesigns and marketing … continue to change consumer sentiment around the brand.

“Their deep push into fashion right now — providing consumers really the only place to go right now for reliable low prices and the convenience of a mass retailer, [and] having everything that they would need to purchase in one trip — [have] changed the perception is of Walmart, and I think will continue to change it in the coming years,” Mezzenga said.

The company has also worked on its perception on pay and salaries, promoting opportunities for career advancement and higher salaries, especially in management roles. In 2015, Walmart raised entry-level wages to $9 per hour, and again in 2016 to $10 per hour. By 2021, Walmart increased its average pay to more than $15 an hour, though it kept its minimum starting wage at $11 an hour.

“Walmart, in particular, has worked very hard to reposition themselves as investing in the communities where they are building their stores and the people in those communities,” Mezzenga said. “I think that’s paying off for them now.”

This year, Walmart expanded its 10% employee discount to include most grocery products. The company last year implemented a new bonus for hourly store associates based on how they drive sales and profit. It said earlier this year that market managers can make up to $620,000 after stock grants and bonuses, and in 2024, it raised the average salary for store managers to $128,000 a year.

“In general, retail is no longer the low platform on the toting pole, in terms of pay in a given geography,” Gildenberg said, adding that there are other sectors that wage-related activism now centers on. “If you’re worried about deflating wage costs, which was one of the big pressure points that Walmart got for years, … you’re going to worry about what gig workers are paid.”

Additionally, Gartner retail analyst Brad Jashinsky said that, after the last few years of high inflation, value-focused retailers especially resonate with people in a positive way. “They can accurately say that they’re able to bring in more options, more affordability into these communities,” Jashinsky said.

Another change over the last few decades is the number of companies that are active in small towns, including e-commerce businesses, that now also get a share of negative attention. Even retailers like Target that once stuck closer to big cities have expanded into very rural areas.

“There are a lot more retailers that are coming in, whereas 20, 30 years ago, Walmart would be the big story for a year or two while it was [being] developed and coming into a small town,” Jashinsky said. “The landscape has changed significantly.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/2025_5-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 22:12:10.747161

HP saw AI PC shipments increase faster than anticipated during the three months ending July 31, despite tariff-related supply chain concerns, CFO Karen Parkhill said Monday at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference.

The premium units accounted for one-quarter of the company’s Q3 2025 shipments, a threshold HP hadn’t expected to surpass until the end of the year, according to Parkhill. HP anticipates AI-optimized PCs will comprise half of its PC business within the next two years.

“AI PCs are a little bit about future-proofing right now,” said Parkhill, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. “We see CIOs making that decision to refresh their installed base with AI PCs because they don’t want to be outdated in a year or two.”

Dive Insight:

The PC market has been in recovery mode for more than two years, with shipments inching up quarter by quarter after a prolonged, post-pandemic tumble.

Enterprises that invested heavily in hardware to support remote workers in 2020 waited out a looming recession, the arrival of AI PCs and, most recently, the potential effects of a tariff-triggered trade war before embarking on a full refresh.

In the US, shipments were flat during the second quarter, despite a 6.5% year-over-year global increase, according to IDC, as vendors raced to avoid heavy levies.

Adoption of AI PCs slowed during the first half of the year, according to Gartner. Last month, the analyst firm said that AI units will account for less than one-third of global PC sales by the end of the year, down from a prior forecast of 43%.

Prospects for AI PC adoption have been buoyed by a proliferation of portable generative AI apps, modestly sized large language models and task-specific assistants. The broader PC market is being driven by aging enterprise devices and Microsoft’s imminent end-of-support deadline for Windows 10.

“We’re about to move into a COVID-like refresh cycle,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Clark O’Niell told CIO Dive. While O’Niell has yet see a pressing need for PCs with AI processing power, the units are gaining enterprise traction.

“It’s more of a hedge bet right now,” O’Niell said. “You don’t want to be the procurement guy that didn’t invest ahead of the curve for AI.”

HP reduced its exposure to U.S. tariffs by shifting manufacturing locations after President Donald Trump announced the initial regime in April and is bullish on its line of AI PCs and demand for workstations compatible with Windows 11, according to Parkhill.

“We’ve been moving quite rapidly to move our manufacturing and our supply chain outside of China and, by this past quarter, nearly all of the demand that we’ve been fulfilling in the United States has been manufactured outside of China,” said Parkhill. “We’ve moved it to Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico and, the federal business that we have, we produced in the U.S.”

HP saw its revenues increase 3% year over year to $13.9 billion, fueled largely by the ongoing Windows 11 refresh, AI PC adoption and services growth, President and CEO Enrique Lores said during an earnings call last month.

“The key thing behind AI PCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that the AI PCs have,” Lores said, pointing to Adobe and Zoom apps running AI on PCs.

HP expects AI capabilities to raise the average price of its PCs by 5% to 10% over the next few years.

“AI PCs are premium products,” Parkhill said. “They do carry a higher price and higher margin with them.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/0f_1rFjkjuR8785DBnmfQuJLlxiQFeS1DPHfUpaw5UM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTc5MDUzMzMyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-09 18:16:42.319412

The scale of geopolitical risk is reshaping strategies, but businesses have demonstrated resilience and adaptability.
As they continue to navigate these turbulent conditions, creativity and foresight will be essential in charting a course through the evolving global M&A landscape.","M&A activity has faced significant challenges over the past five years. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, which caused deal values and volumes to plummet to their lowest levels in decades, companies worldwide have endured a prolonged period of disruption. As the global economy began to recover, soaring interest rates in 2021 prompted many executives to reassess deal economics, slowing activity to near-pandemic lows. Geopolitical uncertainty – particularly the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East – further compounded these challenges by increasing volatility, impacting valuations and tightening financing conditions. The cumulative effect of these pressures has led to a recalibration of corporate ambition. Where bold expansion plans once dominated boardroom agendas, caution and contingency now prevail.

The war in Ukraine, which began in 2022, has disrupted European security and strained global supply chains, leading to higher costs and operational uncertainty for businesses worldwide. Similarly, conflicts in the Middle East have heightened geopolitical risk, contributing to energy market volatility and broader economic instability. These conflicts have not only reshaped regional alliances but have also forced multinational corporations to reconsider their exposure to politically sensitive jurisdictions.

In response to these dynamics – alongside the enduring lessons of the pandemic and mounting climate risks – many businesses are reassessing their M&A strategies. Boards and investment committees are increasingly scrutinising geopolitical risks in acquisitions, joint ventures and supply chains. Across industry surveys and reports, geopolitical risk is now cited as one of the most influential factors shaping investment strategies. This marks a significant shift in corporate governance, where geopolitical literacy is becoming as essential as financial acumen. The boardroom is no longer a sanctuary from global turbulence – it is a frontline for strategic adaptation.

The shift from growth to risk management

Uneven growth forecasts and abundant dry powder are creating both opportunities and challenges. As of December 2024, global dry powder stood at $2.5 trillion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. US funds lead the way, with firms such as KKR and Apollo Global Management each reportedly holding over $40bn. Political and economic turbulence in the US and Europe throughout 2024 – including widespread elections – prompted many dealmakers to pause and reassess. The sheer volume of undeployed capital is both a source of optimism and anxiety: optimism for potential dealmaking, anxiety due to the pressure to deploy it wisely amid uncertainty. Capital is abundant, but confidence is elusive.

Further complicating the landscape, the impact of US tariffs on various countries and trading blocs has undermined market confidence. Financial markets reacted sharply to tariff announcements, introducing volatility that dampened M&A activity. The most notable concern remains the US-China relationship. Tensions escalated during President Trump’s first term and have continued into his second, with the administration supporting intensified protectionist policies. These include higher tariffs on Chinese imports, stricter enforcement of foreign investment regulations under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, and increased scrutiny of Chinese technology investments. This regulatory tightening has led to a chilling effect on cross-border dealmaking, particularly in sectors deemed strategically sensitive.

From January 2025, US persons and their controlled foreign entities became subject to restrictions when engaging in transactions with foreign persons in “countries of concern” – currently limited to China, including the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions – in sensitive sectors such as semiconductors, microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). The European Commission has expressed interest in implementing a similar regime. If adopted, such measures could signal a new era of transatlantic alignment on investment controls, further fragmenting the global M&A landscape.

Despite these headwinds, deals are still being completed. According to PwC, global M&A volumes declined by 9 percent in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, yet deal values rose by 15 percent. Mergermarket data shows that US deal volumes at the start of 2025 fell to their lowest level in over two decades, with only 1100 transactions signed by 18 February – the slowest start since 2003. This divergence between volume and value suggests that while fewer deals are being done, those that proceed are larger, more strategic and more thoroughly vetted. Quality is overtaking quantity as the new metric of deal success.

PwC observed continued activity in companies with a domestic focus and in sectors less exposed to tariffs, such as services. Larger firms with strong cash flow and healthy prospects remain attractive targets. However, companies outside these parameters have struggled. In the US, a PwC Pulse Survey from May 2025 revealed that 30 percent of companies had paused or revisited deals due to tariff uncertainty. Nevertheless, 51 percent of US companies still plan to pursue deals, reflecting a persistent drive to transform and reinvent business models. This resilience underscores the enduring appeal of M&A as a lever for strategic transformation, even in turbulent times.

Boston Consulting Group reported that total global M&A deal value in the first half of 2025 reached $1.1 trillion – a 2 percent decline from the previous six months and below historical averages. Regional disparities were significant. Transactions involving targets in the Americas totalled $724bn, up 23 percent from the second half of 2024. North America, particularly the US, accounted for $685bn, or 62 percent of global deal value. European deal value fell to $201bn, a 14 percent decrease, while Asia-Pacific activity dropped 43 percent to $155bn, reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions and local challenges. The steep decline in Asia-Pacific activity highlights the vulnerability of emerging markets to geopolitical shocks and regulatory unpredictability.

Sector performance varied. The industrials sector saw the strongest rebound, with a 62 percent increase in aggregate deal value, followed by energy (54 percent) and healthcare (23 percent). In contrast, the materials and consumer sectors experienced sharp declines of 49 and 50 percent respectively, due to fewer large transactions. This uneven sectoral performance reflects shifting investor priorities, with capital flowing toward resilience and away from discretionary exposure. Investors are chasing certainty, not just returns.

Megadeal activity – defined as transactions exceeding $10bn – remained steady, with 24 deals announced in the first half of 2025, matching the previous six months. However, the number of large deals (valued at over $500m) fell below the long-term average of 60 to 80 per month, indicating continued caution among dealmakers. The persistence of megadeals amid broader caution suggests that strategic imperatives are still driving bold moves, albeit selectively.

Private equity (PE) activity increased during the first half of 2025, as financial sponsors faced mounting pressure to deploy their substantial dry powder. In contrast, early and late stage funding for start-ups remained subdued, despite strong interest in AI ventures. Bifurcation between PE and venture capital reflects differing risk appetites and time horizons in the current climate.

Protectionism and policy: the new barriers to M&A

While the US has led the charge on protectionist policies, it is not alone. Other jurisdictions are also adopting measures that complicate dealmaking. The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, set to take effect in 2026, will impose tariffs on carbon-intensive imports to protect domestic industries. In the UK, the government has expanded its powers to scrutinise and potentially block foreign M&A on national security grounds. The scope of reviewable transactions has widened, particularly in critical sectors such as defence, dual-use technologies and advanced tech. These developments have hindered M&A and deterred foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the Department for Business and Trade, the number of FDI projects in the UK fell to 1375 in the financial year ending March 2025 – a 12 percent decline from the previous year and the lowest level since records began in 2007-08. This decline in FDI is a sobering reminder that national security concerns, while legitimate, can carry unintended economic consequences.

In this climate, dealmakers are increasingly turning to innovative structuring techniques to navigate regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical headwinds. Dual-track processes – where companies simultaneously pursue a sale and an initial public offering – are gaining popularity as a way to hedge against market volatility. Meanwhile, reverse mergers and special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transactions, though less dominant than in previous years, are still being considered in niche scenarios where traditional exits are constrained. Creativity in deal structuring has become a strategic necessity.

Legal and compliance teams are playing a more central role in deal execution, often involved from the earliest stages of due diligence. Their input is critical in assessing exposure to sanctions regimes, export controls and foreign ownership restrictions. This shift reflects a broader trend toward embedding geopolitical intelligence into the core of corporate strategy, rather than treating it as a peripheral concern. The rise of legal foresight as a strategic asset is transforming how deals are conceived, negotiated and closed.

Technology is also reshaping how deals are sourced, evaluated and executed. Advanced analytics and AI-driven platforms are helping firms model complex risk scenarios and simulate post-merger integration outcomes. These tools are particularly valuable in cross-border transactions, where regulatory landscapes can shift rapidly and unpredictably. Digital tools are no longer confined to streamlining operations – they are reshaping how organisations perceive, interpret and act on strategic intelligence.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are becoming more prominent in M&A decision making. Investors and boards are increasingly demanding that acquisitions align with sustainability goals and ethical standards. This has led to heightened scrutiny of targets’ supply chains, labour practices and carbon footprints. In some cases, ESG considerations have been decisive in deal approval or rejection – a compass guiding strategic direction.

The talent dimension of M&A is also evolving. With remote work and digital collaboration now entrenched, integration planning must account for cultural alignment across dispersed teams. Human capital assessments – once a secondary concern – are now central to value creation strategies, especially in knowledge-intensive sectors such as technology and professional services. People strategy is emerging as a critical determinant of post-deal success.

Creativity, compliance and culture

Looking ahead, dealmakers will need to balance agility with discipline. The ability to pivot quickly in response to geopolitical shocks must be matched by rigorous planning and execution. Those who succeed will likely be firms that combine strategic clarity with operational flexibility, supported by robust governance frameworks and a deep understanding of global dynamics. In this new era, adaptability is a competitive advantage.

M&A leaders are refining their strategies in several ways. Risk analysis is being intensified, with robust scenario planning to anticipate disruptions – although the unpredictability of the Trump administration’s tariff policy presents a particular challenge. Firms are also exploring earn-outs and contingent payments to mitigate economic volatility. Many are pivoting toward domestic transactions to reduce cross-border risk. Moreover, dealmakers are prioritising long-term value creation over short-term gains, adopting a more cautious and strategic approach. This recalibration signals a maturing of the M&A mindset – one that favours resilience over rapid returns.

Despite persistent uncertainty, companies remain committed to pursuing M&A. The scale of geopolitical risk is reshaping strategies, but businesses have demonstrated resilience and adaptability. As they continue to navigate these turbulent conditions, creativity and foresight will be essential in charting a course through the evolving global M&A landscape.

He states that pursuant to a three month contractual notice period in the secondment agreement, Maynooth University was paid €59,000 in respect of former Director General’s remuneration from May 27, 2024 to August 31, 2024.

Professor Nolan took up the prestigious post of Director General at SFI in January 2022 on secondment from Maynooth University and the annual basic salary for the post in 2022 was €222,000.

Earlier this year, it emerged that Professor Nolan has returned to Maynooth University where he is conducting research on the medical condition sleep apnoea.

In the statement read in the Court of Appeal, the State-funded research agency said the litigation with its former chief has been ""damaging to the reputations of all parties"" and it is pleased that they have agreed to bring the case to a conclusion.

Professor Nolan sued the foundation in May 2024 seeking to prevent his dismissal.

The High Court granted him a short injunction halting his dismissal from his director general post for five weeks while various court applications were pending. The same judge, Mr Justice Rory Mulcahy, in June refused to substantially extend the injunction.

Counsel for SFI, now called Taighde Eireann/Research Ireland as a result of a merger of SFI and the Irish Research Council, Mark Connaughton SC told the Court of Appeal in December 2024 that his client regrets the ""unauthorised and harmful publication (from unknown sources) of incomplete internal reports"".

This is related to an SFI inquiry into claims made against Professor Nolan, then director general, by five senior staff members in December 2023. Professor Nolan strongly disputed the allegations.

""We confirm that there were no findings of misconduct or poor performance made against Professor Nolan and the termination of his contract was never intended to imply any finding of wrongdoing on his part,"" the statement continued.

The ""significant reputational damage"" to him and the agency flowing from the unauthorised publication of internal reports is ""acknowledged"", it read.

In an interview with The Irish Times in February this year, Professor Nolan said: ""The events of last year have allowed me to return to the very stimulating work of fundamental research"".

Prof Nolan also said Maynooth University had been extraordinarily supportive to him

The payout to Prof Nolan - who became a household name during the Covid-19 pandemic when he served as a member of the high-profile National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) - is revealed in Science Foundation Ireland’s financial statements for 2024.

The financial statements show that SFI's own legal bill from Prof Nolan’s severance totalled €367,000, and a €59,000 SFI payout concerning a three-month contractual notice period brings SFI’s total bill to €901,000 before insurance payouts from AIG are taken into account.

The report reveals SFI received contributions from insurer, AIG, under SFI’s Employment Practices Insurance Policy of €200,000 towards the severance payments and €292,000 in respect of its own legal costs.

The payouts drew the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy and in his report accompanying the financial statements, Mr McCarthy states that “the net cost to Science Foundation Ireland arising from the termination of the former Director General’s employment was €409,000”.

The intravesical gemcitabine-releasing system, previously known as TAR-200, treats patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or without papillary tumors.

A healthcare professional places TAR-200 into the bladder using a co-packaged urinary placement catheter. The procedure takes place in an outpatient setting in less than five minutes and requires no general anesthesia or further monitoring. Inlexzo remains in the bladder for three weeks per treatment cycle for up to 14 cycles.

According to J&J, it’s the first and only intravesical drug-releasing system (iDRS) to provide extended local delivery of a cancer medication into the bladder.

J&J calls Inlexzo a potentially practice-changing approach for treating certain types of bladder cancer. The FDA granted priority review to a new drug application (NDA) for the system earlier this year.

The Phase 2b SunRISe-1 study, which demonstrated an 82.4% complete response rate, supported the FDA approval. More than half (52.9%) of patients remained cancer-free at least one year or more after achieving a complete response. J&J noted that the majority of adverse reactions proved mild and moderate.

Just as Gemini is known to make up facts for its AI summaries, AI agents can also be prone to hallucinations.
Leading AI agents will be easier in some regards, but some complexities must not be overlooked.
Effectively leading AI teams requires a division of responsibility between AI agents and human workers who use AI to ensure that their skills are best optimized.","Stepping into leadership roles has never been easy, considering the overarching tasks of managing a diverse cast of people, but in the era of AI, matters are growing increasingly more complex. In 2025, we have witnessed the arrival of digital AI employees and colleagues, along with an increasing number of AI tools being introduced to the workplace. These changes demand an altered approach to leadership.

From the supervision of such tools to the management of workers around this technology, the leadership of AI teams requires nuance and consideration. Leading AI agents haven’t become a central responsibility for many managers, leaders, and HR teams just yet, but we see a growing need for a transformation in the management of the AI-empowered workforce.

It’s Time for Manager and HR Teams to Start Leading AI Teams with Greater Care

From financial institutions like BNY Mellon to retailers like Walmart, many organizations have deployed AI agents to bolster their workforce. While some of these agents take the shape of individual employees who are required to report to their own managers, others are mere chatbots that handle some degree of the dissemination of information but perform no other functions independently.

Employees who work alongside these tools are also being instructed to use AI in their own work, with the ability to adapt to these tools, even becoming a part of their performance reviews. Having to grapple with the arrival of AI has already been difficult for those who have lost their jobs as a result, but the impact has been equally severe on workers who are doing their best to adapt to the changing times while worrying about the future of their careers.

Ensuring the right tone of leadership for AI teams requires much of the same traditional skillsets that have been prioritized over the years, but there is also a growing need for a more informed approach to tackling the overlap of tech and humanity.

The Modern Frontier: Leading the AI Transformation and Managing AI Agents

AI is still a new and novel concept for the large majority of businesses, but most are keen on adopting the technology in the near future. The deployment of AI agents is not the first application of this technology for most organizations, but nonetheless, it requires preparation. Unlike their human counterparts, AI agents don’t require empathy and sensitivity, but they do require understanding.

While these AI agents won’t make a demand for better benefits or workplace culture, they likely will require detailed instructions on how to get a job done and the exact parameters that need to be met. AI agents are not designed to make voluntary observations or draw from team learnings unless explicitly taught to do so, making leading AI teams less about collaboration and more about clarity. There is no degree of charisma and competency that will impress the AI to improve its performance.

Unlike what some believe, AI agents are not infallible either. Just as Gemini is known to make up facts for its AI summaries, AI agents can also be prone to hallucinations. A word of caution and correction that may be enough to correct human error may not be sufficient with technology. These fluctuations between human capability and AI potential may appear minor at first glance, but they can have lasting effects on the company’s performance. Leading AI agents will be easier in some regards, but some complexities must not be overlooked.

Leadership for AI Teams Requires an Exploration of the Human Experience

Leading the AI transformation with AI agents is just one part of the challenge that awaits leaders. For the most part, human labor will continue to remain essential to any workforce, even if the nature of their roles and job descriptions evolves. Employees who are asked to utilize AI have concerns of their own, many of which they are likely to be afraid to share for fear of being marked as regressive.

Still, asking questions and understanding these concerns can mean the difference between effective and ineffective adoption of AI. Putting employee fears to rest and training them to use and interact with this technology is a big part of the responsibility of the leaders. Introducing new tech is not enough when employees are not sure how to make the most of it.

Effectively leading AI teams requires a division of responsibility between AI agents and human workers who use AI to ensure that their skills are best optimized. Apart from the delegation of work, there is also the question of ethics that often comes up when using AI. Navigating these challenges falls to leaders, and it’s up to these management teams to choose a course of action that benefits both the organization and its employees and customers.

Growing Calls for AI-Powered Leadership Also Threaten Leadership Roles

Just as organizations have grown comfortable with the conversation of AI employees, many employees have started opening themselves up to the idea of AI leaders. Many believe that AI leaders may be fairer and apolitical about making decisions regarding their careers, but there are also some reservations about allowing AI to handle matters that require empathy. We haven’t yet reached a point where AI CEOs run organizations instead of actual leaders, but that future may not be a distant one.

Even with such changes on the horizon, it’s hard to believe that real leaders are going anywhere. AI-supported leadership is certainly on the cards; however, it requires leaders to familiarize themselves with the technology as much as possible to understand its effects on the workforce. Leading AI teams and being aware of the needs based on their human-tech makeup is a growing challenge for leaders to face head-on.

The technological revolution goes beyond acquiring and investing in AI, and lands on how efficiently leaders are able to prepare for its real effect on the organization as a whole.",https://www.thehrdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leading-AI-teams.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:03.381602

Tina Kotek is weighing a variety of options to safeguard COVID vaccine access at pharmacies.
Kennedy is considering appointing critics of COVID-19 vaccines to the panel, the Washington Post reported Monday.","One of the nation’s largest pharmaceutical chains has walked back its offering of the COVID-19 vaccine to Oregonians without a prescription as pharmacies and the state government await clarity from a federal public health agency in the midst of political upheaval.

Patients in Oregon and nationwide have struggled to make appointments for COVID boosters, which in recent years have been a routine fall offering alongside flu shots, after the federal Food and Drug Administration tried to limit who can get the shots.

CVS Pharmacy spokesperson Amy Thibault told the Capital Chronicle on Friday that the company was offering the vaccine in the state, while acknowledging the potential for individual appointment cancellations at its pharmacies. The company has been promoting access without a prescription in the state as recently as last week, when the democratic governors of Oregon, Washington and California announced a “West Coast Health Alliance” aimed at safeguarding access to vaccines.

The state Board of Pharmacy on Friday said it would have more clarity for vaccine access rules after the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meets on Sept. 18-19. That’s the first meeting since the FDA issued more restrictive annual guidance in August which limited the vaccine to people aged 65 or older or those with an underlying health condition that would risk severe illness.

Thibault did not respond to follow-up questions about the restrictions Friday, when the Capital Chronicle reported Gov. Tina Kotek is weighing a variety of options to safeguard COVID vaccine access at pharmacies. One option could be a standing order guaranteeing the vaccine to individuals age 6 months or older, similar to one issued in Washington.

But in a statement Tuesday morning, Thibault said the company was shifting course.

“After reviewing clarifying guidance issued last week, we’re only offering updated COVID-19 vaccinations to patients who present a prescription from an authorized prescriber,” she said in a statement. “As a result, appointments cannot currently be scheduled online in Oregon. Patients can walk in to any CVS Pharmacy location, present a prescription and receive the vaccination.”

The new regulations from CVS bring it in line with guidance that has frustrated patients across the state. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy stressed Friday that it would require prescriptions for approval and await more information from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, of which U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy removed all members in June. Kennedy is considering appointing critics of COVID-19 vaccines to the panel, the Washington Post reported Monday.

Pediatrician and state Sen. Lisa Reynolds, D-Portland, urged the state to adopt a standing order and questioned the value of waiting till mid-September for the federal government.

“Waiting until the ACIP meeting (Sept 18-19) will cause unnecessary delays,” she wrote in a statement. “And don’t we expect the ACIP recommendations to mirror the FDA approval?”",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1254511513-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:22.307587

LQR House holds its own with a blend of integrated marketing-to-sales, in-house brands, and strong data chops, although it’s still much smaller and less cashed-up than the big names.

Recent Performance

Over the past year, YHC’s stock has dropped about 81%, down from several dollars to just $0.75 as of September 9th, 2025. In comparison, the S&P 500 managed a one-year total return of roughly 14.8% through July. This underperformance reflects both market-wide jitters (in part from April’s tariff shocks) and some stock-specific woes—like ongoing struggles to turn a profit, Nasdaq compliance headaches (including a 35-for-1 reverse split), and investor doubts around LQR House’s pivots into crypto and Bitcoin mining.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

LQR House’s 2024 audited revenue jumped 123.2% year-over-year, hitting $2.50 million (vs. $1.12 million in 2023). This surge followed a business overhaul aimed at cutting fat and focusing on more profitable areas. Management is aiming for positive EBIDA—earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization—in 2025 as costs in marketing level out. Analysts are predicting around 68% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, powered by SWOL Tequila’s push into global markets, new marketing tie-ups (Montauk Distilling, TikTok), and a bigger online audience via SEO. Longer term, the industry tailwinds (like growing DTC adoption and rising subscriptions) should keep revenue rising at a mid-teens pace.

Quality & Moat

LQR House is still deep in the red: over the last twelve months, it posted a $22.7 million net loss on just $2.39 million in revenue. That’s an eye-watering –950% operating margin, compared to 18.2% for the average company. Return on invested capital is also painful at –167% (market average: +11.1%), and free cash flow yield lands at –458% (market: +1.9%). While net debt to EBITDA sits low at 0.20x (vs. the broader market’s 1.41x), that doesn’t offset the ongoing lack of profits. LQR’s competitive moat is still forming; its proprietary analytics and brand-making could pay off, but the company’s limited scale, strict liquor rules, and big-name competition make it tough to claim a lasting edge. Insider lock-ups cover around 0.6% of shares and aim to keep trading steady, but they don’t solve the underlying profitability issues.

Valuation

It’s tricky to value LQR House the traditional way due to ongoing losses and a recent reverse split. The enterprise value to sales ratio is more or less irrelevant, but the ballpark price-to-sales ratio (market cap of $7.8 million vs. $2.39 million revenue) comes out to around 3.3x—slightly cheaper than the peer average of 4.6x. Standard metrics like forward P/E and EV/EBITDA aren’t useful here, with both earnings and EBITDA in the red. This low multiple hints at plenty of risk—investors are waiting to see if LQR House can deliver on profitability to unlock any real upside.

Market Sentiment

Market mood is decidedly grim. YHC is trading near its 52-week low. There’s no analyst coverage from Wall Street, implied volatility sits at a hefty 69% (market: 23%), and the beta is 1.22. Shares have tumbled further on regulatory updates and missed profitability targets. Announcements about new board members or partnerships haven’t moved the needle much, and most institutions are sitting this out. Even on message boards and social media, things are quiet—suggesting both low interest and low liquidity.

Key Risks

Profitability and Cash Burn: Negative operating margins (–950%) and a free cash flow yield of –458% show LQR House is burning through cash, so it’ll need fresh financing or asset sales to keep the lights on.

Execution and Scale: Being small puts LQR at a disadvantage when bargaining with suppliers and partners. Failure to build real momentum on CWSpirits.com could stall growth and shrink already thin margins.

Regulatory Complexity: Alcohol e-commerce isn’t a simple online sale—each state and country has its own licensing rules, plus age checks and high shipping costs. That’s a big hurdle for expanding beyond the core market.

High Volatility: Implied volatility of 69%—nearly three times the market average—means LQR's share price is prone to wild swings. That makes it costlier to raise new capital, and existing shareholders risk being diluted.

Competitive Pressure: LQR House faces a crowded field of deep-pocketed rivals like Drizly (Uber), Instacart, and ReserveBar, all of whom can put pressure on market share and margins.

Bull Case

Robust Revenue Growth: Audited 2024 revenues shot up by 123%, with analyst forecasts calling for nearly 68% more growth in 2025—driven by new brand partnerships and global expansion.

EBIDA Profitability Target: Management believes break-even (on an EBIDA basis) is within reach in 2025, thanks to the recent overhaul and tighter cost control.

Undercapitalized Peer Valuations: Compared to the peer group’s 4.6x EV/Sales average, LQR House’s roughly 3.3x price-to-sales ratio leaves room for upside if losses shrink and growth holds up.

Industry Tailwinds: Alcohol e-commerce is growing at a 15% annual clip. LQR’s tech-driven and DTC-friendly model is right in the sweet spot for these industry shifts.

Strategic Partnerships: The company’s board now boasts members with experience in Asia, and it’s forging partnerships with TikTok, Coinbase Prime, and Montauk Distilling—all of which could unlock faster growth.

Bear Case

Ongoing Cash Burn: Burning cash and low margins suggest LQR House will have to keep raising fresh money—hurting existing shareholders and dragging on the stock.

Lack of Profit Margin: A negative 950% operating margin flags some serious structural inefficiencies. Getting to profitability may take longer—and more capital—than planned.

Regulatory and Logistics Hurdles: Complex state-by-state rules for shipping alcohol, plus steep delivery costs, could curb U.S. growth and keep margins under pressure.

Microcap Illiquidity: The stock’s a microcap with little institutional ownership. That means low trading volume, bigger swings, and wider bid/ask spreads.

Strategic Focus Drift: Management’s recent jump into crypto, Bitcoin mining, and AI could take their eye off the core e-commerce and marketing business.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings: The company’s third-quarter results—expected mid-November 2025 (date TBC)—should shed some light on progress for revenue, margins, and cash flow.

Nasdaq Compliance Milestones: Keep an eye on LQR House’s ability to stay in line with Nasdaq’s minimum share price and equity rules. Falling short could put its listing at risk.

SWOL Tequila International Rollout: Investor focus will be on how the SWOL Tequila launch goes in Greece and Thailand, in partnership with Of The Earth. Look for these numbers in forthcoming press releases.

New Marketing Collaborations: Recent campaigns—like the TikTok collaboration (August 2025) and Montauk Distilling’s new rum—will be key metrics to gauge progress in engagement and sales.

Capital-Raising Activities: Announcements around any new share offerings or warrant redemptions will shape LQR’s cash position and have a knock-on effect on valuation.

Investment Conclusion

LQR House (YHC) gives investors a shot at the fast-growing alcohol e-commerce and digital marketing scene, but the ride is bumpy. Rapid revenue growth and a stated path to EBIDA profitability in 2025 provide a turnaround story, with shares currently trading at a discount to sales compared to peers. Still, deep negative margins, high cash burn, and the risks that come with being a tiny, thinly traded company should make investors cautious. For long-term investors with an appetite for risk, YHC could prove interesting—if management delivers on profit targets and lands new brand partners. Until then, expect plenty of volatility and the likelihood that more capital will be needed to keep the growth story alive. Keep an eye on upcoming earnings, regulatory milestones, and the company’s cash runway before deciding whether to take a position.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-09 17:19:54.627534

We are still scratching the surface,” Odenigbo asserted, citing widespread digital advertising abuse targeting children and vulnerable populations.","Nigeria’s advertising industry, which PwC valued at N605.2 billion in 2023 according to its Africa Entertainment and Media Outlook, is on track to reach \$13.6 billion by 2028.

Despite its impressive growth, the industry continues to grapple with critical challenges that threaten its economic contribution.

Notably, PwC identifies Nigeria as the world’s fastest-growing entertainment and media market with a 12.1% compound annual growth rate,

while Statista forecasts that ad spend in the Advertising market will hit US\$1.04bn in 2025.

This positions Nigeria as one of Africa’s largest advertising markets.

Nigeria’s Economy Expands, Advertising Gains Importance

Meanwhile, Nigeria’s economy expanded by 3.13% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, up from 2.27% during the same period in 2024.

The services sector drove this growth, increasing by 4.33% and contributing 57.5% to GDP.

Therefore, the regulatory framework surrounding the advertising industry has become increasingly crucial for sustainable economic development.

Industry stakeholders describe the sector not just as a revenue generator but as an “economic enabler” powering trillion-naira business activities across multiple sectors.

ARCON Intensifies Reform Efforts

In response, the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria (ARCON) has stepped up its efforts to resolve these challenges, particularly focusing on crippling industry debts and delayed payments that have long plagued Nigeria’s advertising sector.

Simultaneously, the council is strengthening its regulatory framework for digital platforms.

Speaking on TVC News during a program titled “Nigeria Advertising Regulation Framework and The Digital Platforms Enforcement,” which Abimbola Mohammed monitored,

ARCON’s director general, Dr. Olalekan Fadolapo, joined Barr. Charles Odenigbo, director general of the Centre for Media and Law Development (CMLD), to discuss comprehensive industry solutions.

Payment Delays Threaten Industry Sustainability

Dr. Fadolapo revealed the damaging effects of extended payment cycles on industry sustainability.

In contrast, Barr. Odenigbo offered legal insights into Nigeria’s evolving advertising regulatory framework.

“Globally, there’s a payment threshold — in the UK it’s 30 days, in Europe it’s 30 days, and in some African countries it’s 45 days.

But when you come to Nigeria, somebody will be giving you a deal of 180 days, 120 days,” Dr. Fadolapo stated. “180 days is like six months.

Imagine a client that says ‘bill me every quarter.’ When will you collect? What is the time value of money?”

He explained that this cycle traps agencies in a system where they work from January to March, bill clients in April, and then wait an additional 120-180 days for payment.

As a result, cash flow and business operations suffer significantly.

Digital Advertising Under ARCON’s Scrutiny

Next, Dr. Fadolapo addressed common misconceptions regarding ARCON’s oversight of digital media.

He emphasized that the agency regulates advertising content—not the digital platforms themselves.

“Content is divided into three: information, entertainment, or advertising.

We don’t regulate information. We don’t regulate entertainment.

We only regulate advertising on traditional media or digital media,” he clarified.

This distinction, he noted, is crucial as Nigeria transitions from e-commerce to a full digital economy.

Dr. Fadolapo identified three key stakeholders in the digital advertising ecosystem: operators (business owners), the public (vulnerable consumers), and the government (regulatory gatekeeper).

“If the government as gatekeeper chooses to leave the operator and the vulnerable general public, there will be maximum exploitation of the general public through advertising,” he warned.

He pointed to over one trillion-naira losses from Ponzi schemes as evidence of unchecked digital advertising abuse.

Nigeria’s Dual Regulatory Model Explained

In addition, Barr. Odenigbo outlined Nigeria’s comprehensive advertising legal framework anchored by the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria Act 2022

“The apex law that regulates advertising today is the ARCON Act 2022, which brought the entire industry community together under one basket,” he stated.

According to him, Nigeria operates under a dual regulatory system, which combines self-regulation by industry bodies with statutory government oversight through ARCON.

This system promotes a corrective, rather than punitive, approach by requiring advertisers to submit materials for pre-exposure vetting to prevent harmful content.

“In Nigeria, we practice a corrective regulatory framework.

Before the action comes up, the law says before you expose an advert, either on traditional media or new media, submit it to ARCON,” Dr. Fadolapo explained.

“If there is any mischief, misinformation, disinformation claim, it would have been solved before you expose.”

Local Content Policy Enforced

Furthermore, Dr. Fadolapo defended ARCON’s enforcement of local content requirements.

He clarified that the directive originates from the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation under the government’s “Nigerian First” policy.

This policy aims to prevent the offshoring of production, which denies local talent crucial opportunities.

“You want to produce an advert for the Nigerian market.

You can spend as much as 750 million naira, 1 billion naira to produce an advert.

Now you take this particular advert to another country, collect your commercial in a flash drive, and fly back to Nigeria after investing 1 billion in that economy,” he illustrated.

The ARCON DG questioned such practices: “Are you saying that the ladies and men in Nigeria are not beautiful or handsome enough to grace your product?

Are you saying you cannot find similar voice in Nigeria?”

As a result, under this policy, advertisers must prove Nigerian involvement in production including models, voice-over artists, and technical crew to strengthen the local advertising ecosystem.

Court Upholds Tribunal’s Powers

Significantly, Barr. Odenigbo highlighted a legal victory in the case of Digi Bay Nigeria vs. the Attorney General of the Federation and ARCON.

In April 2025, the Federal High Court ruled that ARCON holds the authority to issue queries for advertising law violations.

The court also affirmed the Advertising Offences Tribunal’s (AOT) power to impose penalties.

“The court held that ARCON is the body that has the power to issue query to those who violate advertising law in Nigeria.

It also gave recognition to the fact that AOT has power to impose penalties stipulated in the act,” he said.

The AOT, established under Section 37 of the ARCON Act, holds criminal jurisdiction throughout Nigeria.

It has handled over 300 cases since its inception, with appeals going directly to the Court of Appeal by passing lower courts.

Industry Remains Under-Regulated, Officials Say

Despite concerns, both officials dismissed suggestions that Nigeria’s advertising industry is over-regulated.

Instead, they argued for stronger oversight.

“The space is under-regulated.

We are still scratching the surface,” Odenigbo asserted, citing widespread digital advertising abuse targeting children and vulnerable populations.

Dr. Fadolapo revealed that ARCON recently intercepted an abortion-related advert sent into Nigeria from abroad, showcasing the challenges of cross-border digital advertising.

“You can be in another country, as close as Ghana, and you’ll be throwing advert into Nigeria,” he noted.

Vetting Process Further Clarified

Dr. Fadolapo clarified that ARCON does not vet advertisements directly.

Instead, it supports the Advertising Standards Panel (ASP), a 20-member body representing the organized private sector and regulatory agencies.

This panel oversees pre-vetting, vetting, and post-vetting compliance checks.

Currently, only three categories remain exempt from vetting: obituaries, vacancy announcements, and bank financial reports.

However, pressure is mounting to include financial reports in vetting.

The agency previously excluded goodwill messages until a controversial bank advert stating it would “rise like Agege bread” prompted policy review.

ARCON Reforms Industry Ethics and Payments

To combat systemic challenges, ARCON has introduced several reforms, including zero debt policies, pitch protection fees, and disengagement protocols.

One such protocol ensures that clients cannot terminate agency relationships while still owing substantial debts and then immediately hire new agencies.

“You can fire your agency.

However, if you are firing your agency, make sure you close the account and bring the business to closure.

You can’t be owing me 500 million, fire me, and engage agency B,” Dr. Fadolapo explained.

Regulatory Future Focuses on Accountability

In conclusion, ARCON’s regulatory framework aims to build an ethical and accountable advertising landscape.

It seeks to protect consumers while ensuring the sustainability of Nigeria’s trillion-naira advertising industry.

Both officials emphasized that the country needs stronger—not weaker—regulation as the sector continues to grow as an economic enabler.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG-20250909-WA0007.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:20:56.059810

Previous generations of the Apple Watch, which first hit the market with its first generation in 2015, have featured health monitoring features including sleep tracking, blood oxygen detecting, fitness tracking, heart rate monitoring, and menstrual cycle monitoring.

In 2018, the Apple Watch secured its first FDA approval when it added a feature to detect irregular heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation. It also earned clearance for its fall detection feature.

Leading up to today’s debut of the new watches, tech experts had several predictions for Apple’s newest watch-related health features. Rumors for the Series 11 device included blood pressure tracking, which turned out to be more than a rumor, and blood glucose monitoring capabilities.

Bloomberg also reported that Apple may be working on a comprehensive AI health initiative, code-named ""Project Mulberry.” Project Mulberry would, allegedly, use AI to deliver personalized workout plans based on a user’s existing health and fitness data.

While Series 11 does have new health features of note, it will not go as far as adding blood glucose detection, or any sort of personalized workout data.

What’s new

The new Apple Watch will copy competitors including the Oura Ring, FitBit, and Google Watch, adding a “sleep score” for users.

In 2020, Apple first debuted a sleep tracking feature that calculates the amount of time users spend awake versus sleeping, but thus far, the watch has not provided patients with a composite sleep score.

The score will calculate how many hours a user spends in the various stages of sleep (light, deep, REM) to offer a better understanding of sleep efficiency.

In addition, the Series 11 boasts a 24 hour battery life, allowing users longer wear before having to charge their device. And, as predicted, Apple also touted new hypertension features.

Apple is expecting to warn around 1 million people of possible hypertension through the new add on, according to the conference, and is currently gunning for FDA clearance of the feature, though the company provided no timeline as to when clearance is expected.

Using data from the optical heart rate sensor, the algorithm will use trends and patterns indicating “possible hypertension.”

“Using data from the optical heart sensor, the algorithm looks for chronic high blood pressure by analyzing how your blood vessels respond,” Sumbul Desai, Apple’s health vice president, said during the event.

Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, also used his time to reiterate the importance of other health and safety features that have been included in past devices, and will remain on the Series 11. He reminded users of the importance of the watch’s high heart-rate alerts and fall detection.

There were several user anecdotes shared from patients who discovered adverse health events, like a collapsed lung and an ongoing stroke, thanks to their Apple Watch.

While users are rallying around Apple’s health features, sharing real-life examples of their benefits, not all medical professionals are onboard with new trends in wearable technology.

“Using a fitness tracker to measure your personal health is like measuring a cell with a ruler. Consumer devices use photoplethysmography—light sensors that detect blood flow changes through the skin—which lacks the precision needed for medical decisions,” Andrew Holman, MD, CEO of Inmedix, told MD+DI. “While this technology is sufficient for tracking basic trends like heart rate changes during exercise, it's nowhere near medical-grade precision provided by devices with high-fidelity electrocardiogram.”

The AirPods Pro 3

On top of its flagship watch, Apple is expanding its portfolio of devices that will offer health tracking.

During today’s event, Apple also announced that its newest generation of AirPods, the AirPods Pro 3, will also add new health features.

The Pro 3s will offer a heart rate sensor that can be used during workouts. Users will be able to “utilize AirPods Pro 3 to measure heart rate and track over 50 workout types with the new experience in the Fitness app on iPhone,” according to Apple. “AirPods Pro 3 introduce a custom photoplethysmography sensor that shines invisible infrared light pulsed at 256 times per second to measure light absorption in blood flow.”

The hypertension monitoring debate

As Apple seeks FDA approval for its new hypertension capabilities, it could join the list of companies clashing with the regulatory body over BP monitoring.

In July, WHOOP toed the line by offering a Blood Pressure Index to users with the intent to measure or estimate blood pressure.

WHOOP’s website markets the product as providing “daily systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimations, offering members a new way to understand how blood pressure affects their performance and well-being,” and lists BPI as an example of how WHOOP delivers “medical-grade health & performance insights.”

On July 14, FDA issued a warning letter to WHOOP, noting potential overstepping.

“WHOOP recently received notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asserting that Blood Pressure Insights should be reviewed as a medical device before being available in the United States. We respectfully disagree,” the company posted on its website in response.

“Blood Pressure Insights is a wellness feature, not a medical device. It’s designed to help you understand how your body responds to daily life, not to diagnose or treat any condition. Wellness features like this are common in wearable technology, like tracking your respiratory rate or HRV, and provide valuable insights to support better decisions about your performance without requiring FDA clearance.”

Right now, the difference between needing and not needing FDA approval for a device comes down to “intended use.” While Apple is choosing to seek regulatory approval for this feature, WHOOP did not, which could be what differentiates the two. However, as previously mentioned, it remains to be seen when the Series 11 will earn FDA approval, and what that approval might look like.

“Any device making medical claims about blood pressure will face appropriate FDA scrutiny. The regulatory pathway depends entirely on what Apple claims their device can do—trend tracking versus diagnostic measurement are very different categories,” Dr. Holman said. “But the real challenge isn't just regulatory approval, it’s clinical validity. Apple will need to demonstrate that their data is not only accurate and reliable, but also clinically meaningful for both patients and physicians.”

Physician concerns

While some users may find it helpful to have updated heart rate readings from their AirPods, a composite sleep score, or data on possible high BP readings, physicians warn that this data all must be taken with a grain of salt.

“The fundamental limitation is that these devices can tell you that your heart rate increased, but they can’t tell you why or what it means for your health. Whether it’s heart rate variability, sleep patterns, or activity levels, consumer wearables measure correlations, not causations. Patients need to understand that while wearables are excellent fitness motivators, any concerning trends require clinical evaluation with medical-grade diagnostics to determine the actual causes and appropriate interventions,” Dr. Holman said.

Dr. Holman is not against wearable devices altogether, and like many physicians, he sees the benefits of patients having a growing amount of awareness over their own bodies. The emphasis is on the fact that an Apple Watch cannot function as the end-all-be-all of medical care.

“Patient engagement is always positive, and these devices can encourage healthy behaviors like exercise and sleep tracking. However, physicians need to help patients understand the difference between fitness data and medical diagnostics. The real value comes when patients bring their health concerns to the clinic where we can measure what truly matters with medical-grade precision,” he said.

Apple plans to release the Series 11 at a price point of $399, the same as previous watch generations. The AirPods Pro 3 will retail for $249, the same price as the current generation AirPods Pro 2. Both will go on sale on September 19.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blt6e5b070a446c0cf1/68c0a1aed9ebbc1d4776b76d/Untitled_design_-_2025-09-09T175010.120.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-09 20:08:56.586440

Dive Brief:

Walmart opened a 725,000-square-foot perishable distribution center in Wellford, South Carolina, the retailer announced last week.

The facility receives and processes fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for distribution to 180 Walmart stores. More than 600 full-time employees work at the location, and Walmart is hiring for automation equipment operators and other roles.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center, marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, EVP of supply chain for Walmart U.S., in the announcement.

Dive Insight:

The Wellford facility is the third of five new perishable distribution centers Walmart is opening nationwide as the retail giant continues to beef up its grocery supply chain.

Facilities in Shafter, California, and Lancaster, Texas, are also up and running, with locations in Belvidere, Illinois, and Pilesgrove, New Jersey, slated to follow. Walmart said last year it is adding over half a million square feet per site to four of its traditional perishable distribution centers as well.

The Wellford location and other new perishables-focused facilities can process over double the volume of a traditional distribution center by tapping into automation and artificial intelligence, according to Walmart.

Processing begins when cases from farmers and suppliers arrive at the facility and are stored in an automated storage system. High-tech systems then build store-specific pallets from those cases to ensure eggs and other fragile items are placed near the top to limit damage. Pallets are then wrapped and loaded onto a truck for shipping.

""AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness,"" last week’s announcement said. ""This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.""

BAE Systems’ operations in Minnesota date back to the 1940s, when its Fridley facility produced naval guns for the U.S. Navy during World War II. After more than 80 years, the new facility continues the company’s legacy of service and commitment to the nation, as well as the state’s talented and dedicated workforce.

BAE Systems and Opus broke ground on the new facility in April 2024. Construction was completed in August this year.

Minnesota DEED Helps Business Expand With $4.2M In Funding

Earlier this month, the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) announced $4.2 million in business expansion funding for three projects across the state. These projects are expected to create or retain 587 jobs and leverage more than $270 million in private investment.

“DEED’s business expansion programs create unique opportunities for businesses to boost local economies by creating jobs and stimulating local markets,” said DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek. “I look forward to seeing the positive impact felt not only by these communities, but also by the companies expanding there.”

The Job Creation Fund (JCF) provides financing to new and expanding businesses that meet certain job creation and capital investment targets. The Minnesota Investment Fund (MIF) provides loans for capital equipment to help businesses add new workers and retain high-quality jobs, with a focus on industrial, manufacturing, and technology-related industries.

Here are details on the individual projects:

Boston Scientific, Maple Grove – JCF $1,660,000, MIF $1,000,000: Boston Scientific Corporation is a global medical technology leader that provides a broad range of high-performance solutions that address unmet patient needs and reduce the cost of health care. The total project investment includes an estimated $131 million to expand its facility by approximately 52,500 square feet, adding manufacturing and office space, as well as machinery and equipment. The project is expected to create 440 new jobs within the first three years. Boston Scientific Corporation previously received JCF and MIF funding to construct its other Maple Grove facility in 2023.

Louis Industries Inc., Paynesville – JCF $175,000, MIF $325,000: Louis Industries, Inc., is a modernized steel processing and manufacturing facility equipped with the latest technology in steel tailoring and quality control. The proposed project will add additional manufacturing and office space, expanding the current facility by 42,000 square feet and allowing for the addition of powder coating and lead assembly. The company will invest $7.7 million into the expansion project and will create 15 new jobs within the first two years.

A Foundational Education and Early Career

Berry’s storied career began with a comprehensive education, starting with an associate degree in art from the Borough of Manhattan Community College in 1971. He quickly advanced his learning from there, obtaining a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Queens College in 1973 and a master’s degree in behavioral science, social work, and organizational development from Columbia University in 1975.

The office continues to pursue a separate lawsuit against CVS Caremark for allegedly reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies below acquisition cost.
CVS Caremark has denied wrongdoing in the settled matter and agreed to the resolution to avoid the costs and uncertainties of litigation.","OKLAHOMA CITY (Sept. 9, 2025) – Attorney General Gentner Drummond today announced a more than $32 million settlement with CVS Caremark after the company allegedly kept money that belonged to Oklahoma's state employee health plan.

CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) that manages prescription drug benefits for health plans, including HealthChoice which is Oklahoma’s state employee plan. When drug companies give discounts and rebates for medications, CVS Caremark was supposed to pass that money on to HealthChoice. Instead, the state contends that CVS kept millions of dollars that should have gone to help lower healthcare costs for state employees from January 2020 through December 2024. CVS maintained that it complied with its contractual obligations.

“When a company keeps money that belongs to Oklahoma taxpayers, we're going to fight to get it back,” Drummond said. “This settlement ensures that millions of dollars go where they should have gone all along - to benefit our state employees' healthcare.""

Under the agreement, CVS Caremark will pay $32.1 million to the State of Oklahoma. After deducting attorney fees for outside counsel, in line with Oklahoma state statute, approximately $27 million will go directly to the HealthChoice plan within 30 days. None of the funds will remain with the Attorney General's Office. Instead, Drummond directed the recovery dollars go back to the state plan to benefit state employees, their families and retirees.

""These funds should be used to help keep premiums lower for HealthChoice members,"" Drummond said. ""This recovery reflects our commitment to maximizing benefits for the state employees who serve all Oklahomans and protecting taxpayer dollars that fund these healthcare benefits.""

The Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) oversees HealthChoice. Ellen Buettner, OHCA CEO, welcomed the settlement.

""This settlement ensures millions of dollars will be directed back to the HealthChoice plan, benefiting Oklahoma's state employees and their families,” Buettner said. “This recovery underscores OHCA’s commitment to maximizing the value of healthcare benefits for those who serve our state.""

CVS Caremark must also:

Pay any additional rebate amounts collected for the 2020-2024 period within 90 days;

Pass through all future rebate payments directly to the HealthChoice plan within 90 days of collection; and

Agree to an expanded definition of “rebate” in the state contract to ensure comprehensive coverage of manufacturer payments.

The settlement also includes strengthened contract language that requires Caremark to report and remit all rebates collected to the state plan on a quarterly basis, ensuring greater transparency and accountability, as well as maximum benefits to the state employee health plan for the life of the contract.

""This successful settlement is the result of the team we formed to investigate and negotiate this matter,"" Drummond said. ""This significant recovery would not have been possible without the exceptional work of our Consumer Protection Unit and PBM Compliance and Enforcement Unit. I appreciate the leadership of Deputy Attorney General Michael Leake, who serves as the director of the PBM Compliance and Enforcement Unit.”

This settlement represents the latest action in the Attorney General's ongoing efforts to hold pharmacy benefit managers accountable. The office continues to pursue a separate lawsuit against CVS Caremark for allegedly reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies below acquisition cost.

Walmart opened a 725,000-square-foot perishable distribution center in Wellford, South Carolina, the retailer announced last week.

The facility receives and processes fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for distribution to 180 Walmart stores. More than 600 full-time employees work at the location, and Walmart is hiring for automation equipment operators and other roles.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center, marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, EVP of supply chain for Walmart U.S., in the announcement.

Dive Insight:

The Wellford facility is the third of five new perishable distribution centers Walmart is opening nationwide as the retail giant continues to beef up its grocery supply chain.

Facilities in Shafter, California, and Lancaster, Texas, are also up and running, with locations in Belvidere, Illinois, and Pilesgrove, New Jersey, slated to follow. Walmart said last year it is adding over half a million square feet per site to four of its traditional perishable distribution centers as well.

The Wellford location and other new perishables-focused facilities can process over double the volume of a traditional distribution center by tapping into automation and artificial intelligence, according to Walmart.

Processing begins when cases from farmers and suppliers arrive at the facility and are stored in an automated storage system. High-tech systems then build store-specific pallets from those cases to ensure eggs and other fragile items are placed near the top to limit damage. Pallets are then wrapped and loaded onto a truck for shipping.

“AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness,” last week’s announcement said. “This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/H_cvlPGUXRWFoVIbNJPKgNWMsOHJKFqlLHaVA11XANE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9leHRlcmlvci1vZi1wZXJpc2hhYmxlLWRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi1jZW50ZXItd2VsbGZvcmQtc2MuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-09 15:18:41.614839

French banks, manufacturing innovators, and agile exporters are demonstrating that structural reforms, technological adoption, and international diversification can mitigate political risks.","Political instability in France has reached a critical juncture in 2025, with the collapse of Prime Minister François Bayrou's government and the failure of a €44 billion austerity plan underscoring deepening fiscal and political challenges. Yet, amid this turbulence, certain sectors—banks, manufacturing, and export-driven industries—demonstrate remarkable resilience, offering strategic opportunities for investors willing to navigate the uncertainty. This analysis explores how these sectors are weathering the storm and outlines actionable strategies to capitalize on their strengths.

French Banks: A Pillar of Stability in a Shifting Landscape

French banks have proven their mettle in 2025, maintaining strong credit quality and profitability despite geopolitical headwinds. According to a report by the European Central Bank (ECB), European banks, including major French institutions, exceeded Q1 2025 earnings expectations and upheld full-year guidance, even as global trade tensions escalated. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) further notes that French banks have shown resilience under severe geopolitical and recessionary conditions, with robust capital buffers and stable net interest income.

However, risks persist. Rising sovereign spreads and the potential for credit rating downgrades could increase borrowing costs for businesses and households. For investors, this underscores the importance of selecting banks with strong balance sheets and diversified international exposure. BNP Paribas and Société Générale, for instance, have bolstered their risk management frameworks and operational resilience, positioning them as safer bets in this environment.

Manufacturing: Innovation as a Buffer Against Uncertainty

France's manufacturing sector, particularly in aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals, remains a cornerstone of economic resilience. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, is witnessing a surge in demand for benzylamine—a critical chemical intermediate in drug synthesis. The market is projected to grow at a 6.3% CAGR, reaching $36.8 million by 2032, driven by AI-driven production efficiencies and green chemistry innovations.

Aerospace, another pillar of the sector, benefits from strategic government support. The 2025 French defense budget allocates significant resources to space defense and advanced technologies, signaling long-term commitment to innovation. While foreign direct investment (FDI) in European manufacturing fell by 9% in 2024, France's focus on digitalization and workforce training—highlighted by the OECD—positions it to regain competitiveness.

Investors should prioritize companies leveraging structural reforms and technological adoption. For example, Safran and Thales are integrating AI and automation to offset rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions.

Export-Driven Industries: Adapting to a Fractured Global Trade Order

The 2025 U.S.-China trade war has reshaped global supply chains, but French exporters in machinery, agrifood, and cleantech are adapting. The agrifood sector, in particular, is poised for growth, with the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2025-2034 projecting a 14% increase in global production over the next decade. French agrifood giants like Danone and Lactalis are leveraging productivity gains and sustainable practices to maintain their edge.

Cleantech also presents compelling opportunities. The European Cleantech Q2 Briefing 2025 notes a rebound in venture investment, with EU cleantech funding reaching €2.5 billion in Q2 2025. Policies like the Clean Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act further support this sector, making companies like Orano and EDF attractive for long-term investors.

Actionable Investment Strategies

ETFs and Equities with International Exposure: The 40 Index, trading at 14.8 times forward earnings, offers exposure to globally diversified French blue chips like LVMH, L'Oreal, and TotalEnergies. These firms derive 80% of revenue from overseas markets, insulating them from domestic political volatility.

Sector-Specific ETFs: Consider thematic ETFs focused on pharmaceuticals (e.g., iShares Global Healthcare) or cleantech (e.g., Amundi Cleantech) to capitalize on high-growth niches.

Risk Mitigation via Diversification: For exporters, diversifying supply chains and expanding into emerging markets (e.g., Southeast Asia) can reduce reliance on U.S. trade.

Long-Term Structural Bets: Invest in companies aligning with France's fiscal consolidation goals, such as those in digital services or green infrastructure.

Conclusion

France's political instability in 2025 is a double-edged sword: it introduces uncertainty but also creates opportunities for investors who can identify resilient sectors. French banks, manufacturing innovators, and agile exporters are demonstrating that structural reforms, technological adoption, and international diversification can mitigate political risks. By focusing on these pillars, investors can navigate the turbulence and position themselves for long-term gains in a reordering global economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 18:17:13.648146

Refinery29 has online editions still running in the US, Germany, and France. The Australian edition closed in 2024, but the site still puts out syndicated content.

Former art director at Refinery29 UK Kristine Romano said on Linkedin: “After 5.5 years, my time at Refinery29 has come to an end! Alongside many of my brilliant colleagues, I’ve been made redundant – marking the closure of Refinery29 UK after ten incredible years.”

Freelance writer Toluwalogo Niji-Olawepo posted: “It’s actually really painful to see Refinery29 UK and Unbothered UK come to a close. I can’t pretend this doesn’t hurt… having a story of mine published in its Unbothered section was such a full-circle moment. The platform has played a significant role—both directly and indirectly—in my growth as a writer.”

Niji-Olawepo also commended editor of Unbothered L’Oréal Blackett for “amplifying the stories and voices of black women through Unbothered”.

Chanté Joseph, a freelance writer for Refinery29, acknowledged the closure online, adding the “state of the media is so deeply disheartening”.

“I won’t lie, I’m worried about my future, where I go next, and what my career looks like,” she said. “So many incredible publications that value the stories I have to share are shutting down. I’ve loved being in this space, but now I find myself feeling lost – as if I built my foundations on sand.”

Lauren Gordon, another freelance for Refinery29, said: “I’m honestly gutted to hear that Refinery29 UK and Unbothered are closing.

“Refinery29 was the first space in this industry where I felt safe enough to tell my own hair story…I’ll always be grateful to editors like Jacqueline Kilikita and L’Oréal Blackett, who helped bring so many ideas to life. Being even a small part of R29’s history is something I’ll always be proud of.”

She added the “loss” of Unbothered “hits hardest”, “one of the only places in UK journalism that unapologetically centred Black women and women of colour”.

“Unbothered gave visibility, community, and validation where mainstream media so often falls short,” she said. “Losing it leaves a huge gap that urgently needs to be filled.”

More than ever, there’s truth in the idea that “the most successful people leaders are business leaders,” Morris says.","HR leaders today are racing to keep up with a pace of change that is unprecedented for the profession. AI is transforming all facets of the function, employees need—and HR has to forecast—the skills to innovate in the future, record rates of burnout are dragging down engagement and productivity. How can HR get ahead in such an environment? The HR executive at the largest employer in the United States is doing so with a simple mantra in mind: Take action—and do it today.

HR is an “architect” of the business, says Donna Morris, executive vice president and chief people officer at Walmart. This means HR people professionals need to “get out of the administrative [work] and stop talking about, ‘Do I have a seat at the table?’ ”

Own the role of a “strategist,” Morris says, and use that platform to design talent processes around the vision for future business outcomes. That approach underlies Morris’ work at Walmart, which earned her the title of 2025 HR Executive of the Year from HR Executive.

The award recognizes HR excellence and innovation among leaders who have significantly elevated the strategic role of their function. Morris will be among those honored for excellence in HR and HR technology during the inaugural HR Icons Awards next week in Las Vegas.

Company-changing leadership

Morris joined the retail giant in 2020, just one month before the start of the pandemic, after 17 years at Adobe. Today, she oversees all people operations for the company’s 2.1 million global employees, including 1.5 million in the U.S.—with a focus on the interplay between technology transformation, employee experience and long-term business outcomes.

“As Walmart continues to change and put technology to work to better serve our customers, members and associates in new and exciting ways,” wrote Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, in Morris’ nomination letter, “her leadership continues to change our company. Donna and her team are ensuring our associates remain our priority as we prepare them for the future and provide opportunities to thrive in a tech-powered world.”

AI at Walmart: education and experimentation

As AI rapidly redefines work, Morris has led Walmart’s efforts to design its role in the employee experience.

In 2023, Morris took about 60 team members to the San Francisco Bay Area to do a “deep dive on all things AI.” About two months later, the team rolled out Me@Campus. The all-in-one mobile and desktop solution, for about 50,000 office associates, supports everything from hiring to onboarding, performance management, facilities booking and more.

The platform was later launched as MyWalmart for field-based associates, as the company calls its employees, and Me@Sams for Sam’s Club associates.

Within the platforms, workers have access to My Assistant. Powered by generative AI—and versed in more than 50,000 company policies and procedures—My Assistant was designed to be a “playground” for AI experimentation among employees, who are encouraged to tap the tech for myriad ways to make their jobs more efficient.

As the tool got off the ground, associates across functions and segments participated in “roadshows and bootcamps,” Morris says, which educated them about everything from the potential role of AI at work to the best way to write a prompt. These “regular opportunities” for employees to listen, learn and try the technology have been critical to reducing the fear that often comes with tech integration at work.

Employees across the country have since offered more than 4 million prompts through My Assistant.

“They are now finding ways to disrupt their jobs, or disrupt aspects of their jobs, but they’re not feeling threatened,” Morris says. “Our role in HR is to help equip individuals with skills and provide an environment where they’re not afraid.”

Preparing for AI with transparency and foresight

Employees have to know that change is coming—through AI or other means—and that they shouldn’t fear, but rather, should embrace it, Morris says. Role modeling by HR can be critical to this end. Morris has been working to educate her own team about AI integration so that they can serve as company-wide ambassadors.

For instance, this summer, the total rewards team hosted an expo showcasing how more than 40 associates had leveraged AI in different ways to reimagine their workflows.

“In doing that, it created a comfort level for people to try and experiment and learn,” she says.

Morris says she personally is using AI, specifically ChatGPT, almost daily.

“It’s only making me more effective,” she says.

‘Acknowledge’ the worry

Yet, fear about AI integration is palpable in workforces across industries, Morris notes. HR’s first line of defense against that sentiment, she says, is transparency.

“We have to acknowledge [the fear],” she says. “The more transparent you are, the better.”

Noting the persistent ambiguity in the landscape, however, Morris says frequent communication from HR is essential. Be supportive of change—“to the point of being empathetic,” she advises—and equip workforces with the skills they will need to thrive in a world that is going to look different.

Earlier this month, Walmart announced that it is one of the first participants in the Certificates program from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. In 2026, Walmart associates will have access to free OpenAI certification.

‘Fixing the toil’ in HR with AI

HR’s critical hand in reimagining workflows, roles and its own processes in light of AI’s influence is placing new expectations on the function.

More than ever, there’s truth in the idea that “the most successful people leaders are business leaders,” Morris says.

HR professionals who are “out and in front of AI” are spending time understanding the real business challenges and envisioning how AI could fill in gaps. Walmart, for instance, is leveraging technology to offload administrative work from associates trained in merchandising so they can focus on finding the items that will resonate with customers—boosting both customer and employee experience.

“If we can use technology to take out some of the work that is more duplicative, more operational in nature, then our employees are actually able to spend more of their time on the more human work,” Morris says.

Key to that aim for HR professionals is getting “proximate to the business to figure out what problems they are trying to solve, and where might they be able to apply digital or AI to be more effective and more productive.”

Where is Walmart’s AI journey headed?

That’s the directive for Morris’ team at Walmart, as they focus on “fixing the toil” and enabling HR professionals to concentrate on more people-centric duties.

The work is already proving effective: Walmart built an AI tool that walks job candidates through an interview, prep work that previously took considerable time for recruiters. The team is looking at how AI can be applied for interview scheduling to continue to relieve the administrative burden on recruiters. Morris’ team is also starting to use large language models to predict salary trends in the market, enabling its professionals to spend more time reimagining rewards plans.

“If I were to forecast a year from now,” Morris says, “I would say there’s probably not a single function across the people team here at Walmart that won’t be shaped somehow because of AI.”

Skills for the future

Given the impact that tech is having on Walmart’s operations, including in HR, leaders have been deliberate in ensuring the focus is right: The company is “people-led, tech-powered.”

“We wanted to make sure that we were underscoring the order of how we were going to drive our strategy going forward,” Morris says. “It was going to be people—and then, it was going to be technology.”

That means the company has invested heavily in equipping its people for exactly what it means to be tech-powered, with a focus on skills-building—all part of a $1 billion investment to provide U.S. associates career-focused training by 2026.

“Donna’s leadership at Walmart in upskilling teaches all of us that skills matter more than pedigrees and you need an investment model for your associates,” says Peter Fasolo, former CHRO of Johnson & Johnson, the 2022 HR Executive of the Year and a judge for this year’s competition.

In 2022, its Walmart Academy, which focuses on training, went global. Last year, Walmart significantly expanded the formal learning opportunities available to associates, including more than doubling the short-form certificates and courses offered through Live Better U.

The ROI of skills-building

The education benefit, offered in partnership with Guild, is available to all full- and part-time hourly and salaried associates—from their first day. Currently, more than 136,000 of them have taken advantage of the benefit, Morris says.

The MyWalmart platform, Morris says, is among the avenues through which the company pushes reminders about learning opportunities.

“We are actively working to, frankly, market within our own organization the ability for someone to be educated—on the job or through a pathway like Walmart Academy,” she says.

Associates who have participated in skills-building programs report higher engagement and retention levels, Morris says, as well as more job mobility. This year, about 78% of jobs have been filled internally, she says.

One prime example is the path to being a driver. By this fall, the company will have educated 1,000 associates to go from working in jobs such as at a distribution center to the role of driver, with a starting salary of $90,000.

“We’ve taken the supply of our own internal talent and have focused on, where do we see the future going in terms of skills and capabilities? How do we equip our own associates with those skills and capabilities?” Morris says.

A collaborative approach from the HR Executive of the Year

These are questions Morris is also encouraging other business leaders to consider. She was integral in bringing to life the inaugural Opportunity Summit in Washington, D.C., last year—uniting stakeholders that included business and nonprofit leaders, government officials and workforce experts to explore the potential of skills-based strategies. A key goal and outcome of the event was the development of a skills taxonomy for core frontline roles, encompassing 11 million U.S. jobs, and the launch of the Skills-First Workforce Initiative.

Fasolo worked with Morris and her team during the D.C. summit while he was at J&J.

“Donna and Walmart continue to have the credibility to pull together employers, government officials, NGOs and others to share what we are doing in upskilling,” he says. “The idea is to create a framework to understand a taxonomy for a common language across multiple jobs. This is a great example of Donna’s thought leadership and being a role model for our profession.”

The next summit will be held in Bentonville, Ark., where Walmart is headquartered, in 2026. Then, Morris says, the organization will “pass the baton” to another organizer as stakeholders work to extend the skills framework to cover 40% of U.S. jobs.

“Our largest workforce is a frontline workforce, and we want to celebrate the skills they acquire on the job and make sure that they’re able to capture those skills and communicate about them as they progress their careers,” she says.

Managers of the future

Associates aren’t the only ones whose skills Walmart is investing in.

Morris was a key force behind the 2022 launch of Manager Academy, a week-long, in-person training for managers in Bentonville. By the end of 2025, all managers of U.S. stores, clubs and supply chain operations will have completed the program.

The training takes a unique human-centric approach to management—focusing on company values and how managers can lead with empathy, navigate change and build relationships with both employees and customers.

These are skills, Morris says, that will be increasingly essential in a tech-powered organization.

“We could all walk around with our eyes in our devices, without stepping back and saying as managers and leaders, ‘It’s actually about the human connection,’ ” she says.

When managers are well-equipped with both the technical know-how and an understanding of how to lead with Walmart’s values at the forefront, their leadership becomes more empathetic and effective, Morris says.

For example, she points to a tool Walmart created that can, among other capabilities, push notifications out to managers of attendance red flags. From there, managers can lean into the connection with their employee to get ahead of a potential issue.

In one week this summer, managers made 50,000 check-ins with associates—conversations driven in part by technology.

“That’s digital equipping,” Morris says. “That’s awareness of how to use digital tools, but more importantly, it’s allowing our managers to spend more time with people, which is paramount to our business.”

Wellbeing driven by listening

That investment in Walmart’s people came to life particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the response to which Morris helmed. Among the immediate actions was the rollout of a COVID policy that guaranteed employees paid leave to care for themselves or loved ones during a diagnosis.

“We leaned in to really ensure that their safety and their wellbeing were secured,” she says. The company’s focus on wellbeing—with “real, deliberate” change to support employees’ mental, physical and financial health, such as providing access to counseling for all employees, regardless of whether they participate in the health plan—helped “establish strength and trust and, frankly, even affection between employees and the business,” Morris says.

Staying in tune with the needs of employees is key to how Walmart evolves its benefits offerings to support wellbeing. The Associate Engagement Survey is a critical listening tool, and Morris’ team also “scrapes social data”—from Glassdoor to Reddit—and considers onboarding and exit interview commentary.

At its annual Associates Week—where more than 10,000 associates from around the globe come together for a celebration that has a “career fair” bent to it—employees can offer feedback by participating in listening booths, which are also available at regular associate and leadership meetings.

Walmart’s listening strategy revealed that associates were eager to have more ownership in their employment experience—leading the company to roll out a 3-for-1 stock split to make stock purchases more affordable for employees. Currently, 500,000 associates buy stock regularly, Morris says.

The business case for leading-edge benefits

Employee feedback was also a driver behind the 2022 launch of family-building benefits with partner Kindbody. Associates can access support with fertility treatments, adoption and surrogacy. More than 2,200 employees and their family members have utilized the benefit, with about 275 babies born or on the way.

As HR leaders seek to build a business case for benefits and programs that support employee wellbeing, Morris advises that they lead with business acumen. Know the metrics and margins—and how they could shape the potential investment. Appreciate the business problems you’re trying to solve, and focus on how to actively manage costs—which, ultimately, means managing health outcomes.

Amassing “big data sets” can be a critical tool, she says. For instance, understand the top illnesses affecting certain parts of the workforce; sometimes, small actions—like offering flu clinics in the fall, knowing that absenteeism spikes during flu season—can have meaningful business impacts, Morris says.

“My caveat is: Do not chase what the competition does,” she says. “In HR, we can have envy: ‘This company’s doing that,’ and we need to step back and figure out what we need to do for our own business. It’s not always following what your competition does. It’s what’s right for you.”

A new vision for HR leadership

Viewing talent and business strategy as intrinsically linked, Morris says, is key to evaluating the success of HR efforts. Engagement and retention data are important metrics, but HR should also consider broader business outcomes.

“If business performance starts to soften, then I think you have to step back and say, ‘Are all of our strategies relevant to our people?’ ” she says. “Are they a positive contributor, or are they actually putting a burden on the operating principles of the organization?”

The answers to such questions will grow increasingly complex as the “rate of change accelerates,” Morris notes.

In addition, HR professionals must continue to focus on their own learning to stay on the leading edge in such a dynamic environment. For instance, she recently spent time with the HR leaders at a small AI start-up and OpenAI—in part to stimulate her own “intellectual curiosity” and to role model for her team the power of continuous learning, an essential tool for HR professionals who want to position themselves as strategic contributors.

“All of our jobs continue to morph and be reimagined—I don’t think our learning can ever stop,” she says.

Leading in a transformative moment

Morris is one, Fasolo says, who is always willing to share her own learnings with peers across the profession.

“Donna is on my ‘speed dial’ when I need to work my way through an issue or need a perspective on a workforce issue,” he says.

Constant learning, a willingness to do things differently and the ability to prioritize communication that brings the workforce along can help HR leaders “lead the change” in such an environment.

But, Morris says, getting ahead of change is going to require HR to rethink some long-held norms about the function and their own leadership.

“I will say sometimes in HR, we’re great at changing others. We’re not great at changing ourselves,” she says. “This is a period of time when HR has to be out in front, changing ourselves so that we can actually be role models for the business.”

Top takeaways on HR’s strategic future

The 2025 HR Executive of the Year, Donna Morris of Walmart, says HR needs to embrace change to make their functions truly transformative—from recognizing both the pain points and potential of AI to getting ahead of skills gaps and employee wellbeing challenges.

Here are her top insights for HR professionals riding this wave of change:

AI transformation is as much about the “human” element as it is about the tech. Successful transformation will require HR to understand current and needed workforce skills—and to navigate employee fear through education. With the right strategy, AI can be a force multiplier for a human-centric HR function.

Closing skills gaps can no longer be done organization by organization. Morris advocates for collaborative approaches that bring together employers, government entities, nonprofits and workforce leaders. Employees need to see a defined career path, within and outside their respective organizations, and be armed with the skills to navigate that journey in a quickly changing world.

Wellbeing investment can be a powerful driver of culture. It’s critical to stay attuned to what support employees need to stay engaged, and to leverage business acumen—informed by data-driven insights—to gain leadership buy-in. Wellness strategies that align with employee needs can drive trust and morale in the long term, Morris says.",https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/Executive-of-the-Year.png,N,,2025-09-09 17:21:34.601710

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee Chair Clay Higgins (R-La.) sent a letter last week to David Joyner, president and CEO of CVS Health. In the letter, they accused the company of sending inflammatory and misleading text messages—including warnings about pharmacy closures, higher prescription costs and loss of service providers—to urge customers to pressure Louisiana lawmakers to oppose House Bill 358.

H.B. 358 would ban providers in Louisiana from operating both pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and individual pharmacies. If enacted, the law would prevent CVS Health from simultaneously operating CVS Caremark and its 119 CVS Pharmacy locations in the state.

Dive Insight:

The pairing of one of the world’s largest retailers and a leading AI technology company marks a major moment for the retail industry.

“The future of retail won’t be defined by technology alone — it will be defined by people who know how to use it,” Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said in a LinkedIn post Thursday. “By bringing AI training directly to our associates, we’ll enable our people to maximize the benefit of AI-powered technology — giving them the skills they need to rewrite the playbook and shape the future of retail.”

The news builds on a slew of recent AI-related updates from Walmart.

The mass retailer in July debuted a unified and company-wide AI framework centered around four “super agents.” Those agents (intended to support various business touchpoints and minimize user confusion) include: the customer-facing Sparky agent that launched in June; the partner agent Marty for suppliers, advertisers and sellers; a store-centric associate agent; and an agent for company tech developers.

The updated framework coincided with the announcement that Walmart named former Instacart executive Daniel Danker to be executive vice president of AI acceleration, product and design.

Marketing measurement isn’t just about accountability.

In today’s “do more with less” environment, holistic measurement is essential. Measurement doesn’t just validate the past. It informs what to do next, why it matters, and how it drives the business.

Too often, measurement is fragmented, reactive, or buried in a PowerPoint. That’s a mistake. Marketing must be measured holistically:

Brand Health: Do people know us? Trust us? Want to buy from us? Brand equity, NPS, and ongoing qualitative research give shape to how the Brand is perceived and how that perception shifts over time. And Brand health is one of the most reliable predictors of long-term growth.

Creative Effectiveness: Great media can’t rescue bad creative. Pre-testing and in-flight evaluation (i.e., lifts, testing, or eye tracking) help ensure ideas resonate and evolve. Creative is a multiplier, not a variable to ignore.

Campaign Effectiveness: Paid, organic, owned, and earned media - plus events, sponsorships, content, websites, and macroeconomics - should ladder up to something measurable. But rather than drowning in dashboards, focus on holistic insights: what’s working, what’s not, and where to pivot.

Commercial Impact: Marketing must drive business results. Attribution and incrementality testing help quantify returns and make the case for sustained or increased investment. But be cautious about using ROI as the only success metric. ROI reflects efficiency, not scale. The goal isn’t to chase the highest ROI. ROI may dip, even as revenue grows. The goal is to grow the business efficiently. Any ROI above 1 means you're generating more than you’re spending.

Many organizations struggle with this. Why? Because it’s not easy changing the culture of siloed teams, underinvestment in tech and automation, and “reporting” over insights. Without executive buy-in, integrated systems, and a clear purpose behind the metrics, even the best frameworks fall flat.

High-performing teams embrace a measurement culture rooted in agility and accountability. They test, learn, and adapt. They treat “failures” as feedback loops, not red flags. They prioritize learning agendas and avoid analysis paralysis. Most importantly, they turn data into simple, human insights that inform decisions, not just reports.

Technology is essential. Connecting fragmented data, automating reporting, and surfacing insights in real-time is table stakes. And AI can accelerate everything.

From creative testing to predictive modeling, AI can reduce what used to take weeks to hours. It won’t replace marketers, but it removes friction so they can focus on interpretation, storytelling, and decision-making.

The best CMOs don’t just ask, “What did we get for our spend?” They ask, “What did we learn, and how will we do it better next time?” They also recognize that expectations must remain grounded, e.g., halving the budget is unlikely to deliver exponential growth. Measurement shines not by performing miracles, but by enabling better, faster decisions, within the bounds of reality.

Marketing measurement isn’t just about accountability. It’s about acceleration. It gives marketers the clarity to act, the confidence to invest, and the credibility to lead. To unlock that value, you have to invest in the people, technology, and processes to build that culture.

Major apparel retailers, including Levi Strauss, are increasingly focusing on selling products at full price to test the resilience of their wealthier customer base, as reported by Reuters. This strategy comes amid a broader market environment where the financial health of affluent consumers, bolstered by stock market gains and lower debt, contrasts with the bargain-seeking behavior of lower-income households affected by price increases. According to data from the IndexBox platform, consumer spending patterns in the apparel sector have shown a notable bifurcation, with the top income decile driving a disproportionate share of market activity.

Levi's raised prices on some products in July but reported no slowdown in demand, according to the denim maker's chief financial officer, Harmit Singh. He noted that the core Levi's consumer, who largely earns over $100,000 annually, has remained resilient. This sentiment is echoed by other industry players; Ralph Lauren, Under Armour, and Abercrombie & Fitch are also leaning into a more full-price strategy, as indicated in recent earnings disclosures. The shift is a deliberate move to capitalize on a consumer segment that appears largely unaffected by the cooling labor market and ongoing trade tensions.

The strategy is underpinned by advanced consumer-tracking technology that allows retailers to pivot quickly. Instead of store-wide markdowns, companies can now offer targeted, geo-specific promotions for items that are not moving, helping to protect overall profit margins. Many companies have already absorbed a significant portion of recent tariff costs and, compared to previous years, intend to discount as little as possible through the crucial holiday shopping season, using a test-and-learn approach to pricing seasonal goods.

Ralph Lauren is once again testing the boundaries of fashion and technology with the relaunch of Ask Ralph, this time as an artificial intelligence–powered shopping tool. Available on the brand’s app starting Tuesday, the new feature marks the company’s first consumer-facing AI integration.

The initiative draws on the brand’s long history with digital innovation. When Ralph Lauren first ventured online 25 years ago, Ask Ralph debuted as a simple Q&A platform where the designer and his team fielded 100 of the most common style questions. Today, powered by Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service, the new version brings that legacy into the age of generative AI.

The chat-based tool uses natural language processing to provide shoppable outfit suggestions in real time. For example, a query about what to wear to a winter wedding in Miami generates a carousel of complete Ralph Lauren looks ready to purchase. While the system draws on the company’s archive and philosophy, its focus remains squarely on live inventory and commerce.

David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer, sees the tool as a continuation of the brand’s approach to storytelling through technology. “The most difficult thing for any company is to find the right technology to help you tell your story,” he said. “This feels like a very obvious opportunity — not just because everybody’s talking about it, but because it has an ability to learn with us.”

The technology has been under development for a year, absorbing the designer’s style philosophy, brand DNA, and historical imagery. Still, the service maintains clear boundaries: when asked about competitors or politics, it demurs rather than speculate. “We’re not here to try to be clever with it,” Lauren said. “Our aim was to pull from a live inventory of what’s on the site right now.”

Lauren added that this is just the beginning. Future iterations could include voice activation, integration with the Ralph Lauren Collection business, or expansion across additional platforms. “It’s going to become more and more valuable quickly,” he said, noting that weekly learnings will shape its evolution.

Industry analysts predict generative AI could add $150 billion to $275 billion to fashion’s operating profits by 2030, with consumer-facing tools like Ask Ralph expected to play a significant role. For Ralph Lauren, the move underscores a careful but forward-looking strategy. “Everybody’s racing,” Lauren said. “Don’t. Just stop racing. Set your own pace, understand who you are and move carefully to understand how your brand is best married to technology.”",https://theimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ralph-Lauren-Spring-2025-News-The-Impression-002.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:17:03.956921

And so, we need to rule things in.” The clean energy transition While Chevron specialises in oil and gas, it also advocates for the importance of renewable and clean energy too.
Chevron is expanding its global gas business to meet this demand.
“If you think of the global energy system, it’s a key component,” says Brian Essner, Chevron’s General Manager of LNG Origination & Commercial.","While the push for renewables and clean energy continues at pace, Chevron still believes the need for oil and gas is equally as important.

The energy firm's Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth recently emphasised its dual mandate in a series of interviews, including on CNBC’s Power Lunch with Brian Sullivan, where he said: “We have to meet the demands of the economy today, even as we invest in technologies for tomorrow.”

This simple principle underpins Chevron’s strategy to provide reliable, affordable energy while also lowering the carbon intensity of its portfolio and building out new lower carbon solutions.

Meeting energy needs today while investing for tomorrow

Global energy demand continues to rise due to population growth, industrialisation and the increasing needs of digital infrastructure.

In 2025, Chevron expects to reach one million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin in the US, as well as bring on additional projects in the US Gulf of Mexico and achieve first oil at the Future Growth Project in Tengiz, in Kazakhstan.

Mike also told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan: “We don’t control demand, we supply demand. And so, we will grow our oil and gas business over the next five years.”

While continuing this growth, Chevron is also accelerating investment in reducing operational emissions and scaling new energy technologies.

“We need to reduce the emissions from traditional energy, which we’re doing by reducing our carbon intensity of oil and gas that we produce today,” said Mike.

“At the same time, we’re investing in new technologies to grow new sources of supply as demand for all forms of energy continues to grow.”

Why this balance matters

The world is already witnessing record energy demand, with last year’s oil demand at an all-time high and this year's demand set to be even higher, according to Chevron.

Oil and gas are projected to remain a substantial part of the world’s energy mix to 2050 across a wide range of future scenarios published by the IEA, OPEC, EIA and others.

Sustaining energy security while lowering emissions is therefore essential.

Chevron is advancing multiple pathways to lower carbon energy, including:

Methane reductions: working toward reaching its upstream methane-intensity target by 2028, after reducing the methane intensity of its oil and gas operations by more than 50% since 2016.

Renewable fuels: now the second-largest producer of renewable fuels in the U.S.

Hydrogen and storage: investing in a hydrogen project that enables utility- and industrial-scale storage of renewable energy.

Mike emphasised that durable climate progress requires pragmatic policy that “rules in” more solutions, not fewer.

“There are three things that really matter when you talk about energy: affordability, reliability and the environment,” he said during an interview with Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global.

“If you have an energy policy that focuses on only one of those, you can create unintended consequences and have something that is not sustainable.”

Just as important are scalability and speed. “If we can’t scale them up, they can’t make a difference,” he said in the interview.

“And then if you get solutions that work on scale, we need to do it with some speed and that’s where capital markets come in and you harness private investment.

“If you start to rule parts of the solution out, you’re never going to solve the problem. And so, we need to rule things in.”

The clean energy transition

While Chevron specialises in oil and gas, it also advocates for the importance of renewable and clean energy too.

“We have to be able to do both,” said Mike, speaking at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Summit.

“One of the big challenges for an energy company like ours is we’ve got a big business today that meets the needs of the world, and we’ve got customers and economies around the world that depend on what we do to keep the lights on and the trains going.”

Natural gas is central to enabling an affordable, reliable and lower carbon system. It powers homes and industry, supports manufacturing, fertiliser production and hydrogen generation, and is widely used to generate electricity.

With US electricity consumption projected to hit record highs in 2025–2026 and global electricity demand rising through 2026, gas-fired power provides dispatchable capacity that complements variable renewables and helps integrate more clean energy.

Chevron is expanding its global gas business to meet this demand.

HP is in the lead with a score of 83 out of 100, with Apple and Dell tied at 82, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index’s (ACSI) latest survey.

ACSI notes that HP dropped a point from last year’s score while Apple fell three points. It doesn’t suggest why the former stayed strong while the latter skidded beyond crediting HP for combining “high-quality products with a strong value proposition.”

Dell is the only company to improve in ACSI’s survey, gaining two points from last year’s score of 80. Four other brands earn lower scores in this category, which includes tablets as well as laptops and desktops: Samsung at 81; Lenovo at 79; Amazon at 78; Asus and Microsoft at 76 each; and Acer at 75.

PCMag’s reviewers may disagree with those ratings. Our lists of the best laptops for 2025 and our best tablets list do not include any HP machines. They do, however, appear in our roundup of best business laptops. HP also got a decent score in our February Readers' Choice survey, but not as good as MSI, Asus, Lenovo, or Dell.

The ACSI survey makes broader points about the computer industry, in particular pointing to the call-center experience (the worst-rated part of the computer user industry with a score of 78) as a missed opportunity.

“Contact centers give companies valuable opportunities for customer engagement,” it reads. “The service provided during these interactions can drive overall satisfaction higher and build brand loyalty when customers find helpful representatives who can offer knowledgeable guidance across a variety of topics.”

(Note the absence of any suggestion that AI handle customer support.)

This edition of the index also assesses customer satisfaction with TVs, appliances, and (for the first time) vacuums, in keeping with the ACSI’s habit of surveying consumer attitudes in a few related markets at the same time.

Samsung leads the TV category at 83, with ACSI complimenting Samsung as “a pioneer in introducing cutting-edge technology.” But all of the brands assessed earned high scores: Hisense and Vizio tied for second place with 82 each, LG and TCL tied for third at 81 each (TCL improved notably from last year’s score of 79), and Sony just behind at 80.

Again, our reviewers could quibble with that ranking, as no Samsung sets appear in our best TVs list. In our Readers' Choice survey from last month, however, they came out on top, returning to the winner’s circle for the first time in almost a decade.

In appliances—meaning major kitchen and laundry appliances—Samsung and Whirlpool tie for first at 82 each. LG follows at 81, with Bosch, Electrolux, and Haier (including the GE and Hotpoint brands) tied at 80 apiece. Bosch shows the biggest improvement, having finished last with a score of 78 last year.

ACSI’s coverage of vacuums includes not just robot vacuums but plain old vacuums. Samsung leads this category too with a score of 82, followed by Shark (81), Bissell, and Dyson (80 each), Roomba (78), Dirt Devil, and Eureka (77 apiece), and Electrolux and Hoover (both 76).

This ACSI report concludes with a helpful table listing overall satisfaction with these three categories, as well as every other one ACSI covers. Televisions have a score of 82, household appliances and computers tie at 81, and vacuums follow at 79.

Ikea hopes to open kitchen planning studios, or smaller spaces that offer customers advice on kitchen design, in 10 Best Buy locations in Florida and Texas later this year, the report said.
Tolga Öncü, retail manager at Ingka, which operates almost all Ikea stores worldwide, said this is part of an experiment to expand the retailer’s presence in a way that’s faster than simply opening new stores, per the report.
Best Buy did its “homework in locations where Ikea is not [present],” Öncü said, per the report.
“In-store shopping also gives you access to new customer segments who prefer in-person shopping and can also result in higher conversion rates.”","The Swedish furniture seller is looking into using space inside other retailers’ locations to expand its customer base in “mature” markets in the United States and Europe, the Financial Times reported Tuesday (Sept. 9).

Ikea hopes to open kitchen planning studios, or smaller spaces that offer customers advice on kitchen design, in 10 Best Buy locations in Florida and Texas later this year, the report said.

Tolga Öncü, retail manager at Ingka, which operates almost all Ikea stores worldwide, said this is part of an experiment to expand the retailer’s presence in a way that’s faster than simply opening new stores, per the report.

He added that the Best Buy partnership would bring Ikea “closer to more of the many people” in the U.S. and could be “yet another component for us to accelerate our reach, especially in big mature countries,” according to the report.

Ikea has revamped its business model in recent years, shifting from requiring customers to trek to out-of-town warehouses to pick and assemble the furniture themselves, the report said. It has begun opening shops in city centers, while providing online ordering as well as home delivery and assembly services.

Executives say that customers appreciate the extra convenience of being able to shop on their lunch hour, but some have been frustrated by a lack of availability of products, according to the report.

Best Buy did its “homework in locations where Ikea is not [present],” Öncü said, per the report. “If we were to start and look for a smaller format of Ikea in the same location, it can take years before the square meters become free.”

Ikea is one of relatively few retailers that is still expanding, using its large stores as fulfillment centers for eCommerce orders, the report said.

Emily Amor, a Shopify marketing expert at Digital Darts, told PYMNTS in February that eCommerce brands get immediate credibility when they venture into physical retail.

“It tells customers you’ve grown beyond the screen, proving your popularity and success in a way that online presence alone can’t,” she said. “In-store shopping also gives you access to new customer segments who prefer in-person shopping and can also result in higher conversion rates.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ikea.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:23:38.233274

Big loopholes in sanctions remain Some U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions.
NVIDIA and Intel also ended partnerships with China’s top two surveillance companies in 2019.","BEIJING (AP) — Across China, tens of thousands of people tagged as troublemakers are trapped in a digital cage, barred from leaving their province and sometimes even their homes by the world’s largest digital surveillance apparatus. Most of this technology came from companies in a country that has long claimed to support freedoms worldwide: the United States.

Over the past quarter century, American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warnings from the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.

Most of the companies that responded said they fully complied with all laws, sanctions and U.S. export controls governing business in China, past and present. Here are key findings:

America brought ‘predicative policing’ to China

U.S. companies introduced systems that mine a vast array of information — texts, calls, payments, flights, video, DNA swabs, mail deliveries, the internet, even water and power use — to unearth individuals deemed suspicious and predict their movements. But this technology also allows Chinese police to threaten friends and family and preemptively detain people for crimes they have not even committed. The AP found a Chinese defense contractor, Huadi, worked with IBM in 2009 to design the main policing system for Beijing to censor the internet and crack down on alleged terrorists, the Falun Gong religious sect, and even villagers deemed troublesome. IBM referred to any possible relationship it may have had with Chinese government agencies as “old, stale interactions”: “ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.” Huadi did not respond.

US tech enabled the Xinjiang crackdown

American surveillance technologies allowed a brutal mass detention campaign in the far west region of Xinjiang — targeting, tracking and grading virtually the entire native Uyghur population to forcibly assimilate and subdue them. IBM agents in China sold its i2 software to the Xinjiang police, China’s Ministry of State Security, and many other Chinese police units throughout the 2010s, leaked emails show. One agent, Landasoft, subsequently copied and deployed it as the basis for a predictive policing platform that tagged hundreds of thousands of people as potential terrorists. IBM said it has no record of its i2 software ever being sold to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang, was not aware of any interaction between Landasoft and that bureau and cut ties with Landasoft in 2014. Landasoft did not respond.

Some tech companies even specifically addressed race in their marketing. Dell and a Chinese surveillance firm promoted a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop with “all-race recognition” on its official WeChat account in 2019. And until contacted by AP in August, biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific’s website marketed DNA kits to the Chinese police as “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans.” The Xinjiang government said that it uses surveillance technologies to prevent terrorism, and that Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.”

Companies pitched tech to control citizens

Though the companies often claim they aren’t responsible for how their products are used, some directly pitched their tech as tools for Chinese police to control citizens, marketing materials from IBM, Dell, Cisco, and Seagate show. Their sales pitches — made both publicly and privately — cited Communist Party catchphrases on crushing protest, including “stability maintenance,” “key persons,” and “abnormal gatherings,” and named programs that stifle dissent, such as “Internet Police,” “Sharp Eyes” and the “Golden Shield.” IBM, Dell, Cisco and Seagate said they adhere to all relevant laws.

American tech laid the foundation for Chinese surveillance

American technology laid the foundation for China’s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced. Intel and NVIDIA helped China’s three biggest surveillance companies make their camera systems AI-powered. Contracts to maintain existing IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft software and gear remain ubiquitous, often with third parties. And to this day, concerns remain over where technology sold to China will end up, with former U.S. officials and national security experts criticizing a deal struck this summer for NVIDIA to sell chips used in artificial intelligence to China, saying the technology would fall into the hands of the Chinese military and intelligence. NVIDIA said in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk, but told the AP those relationships no longer continue. NVIDIA said it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed the H20 chips for police surveillance, and the White House and Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.

Big loopholes in sanctions remain

Some U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions. IBM said it has prohibited sales to Tibet and Xinjiang police since 2015, and suspended business relations with defense contractor Huadi in 2019. NVIDIA and Intel also ended partnerships with China’s top two surveillance companies in 2019. However, sanctions experts noted that the laws have significant loopholes and often lag behind new developments. For example, a ban on military and policing gear to China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre does not take into account newer technologies or general-use products that can be applied in policing. They also noted that the law around export controls is complicated.

A cautionary tale

What started in China more than a decade ago could be seen as a cautionary tale for other countries at a time when the use of surveillance technology worldwide is rising sharply, including in the United States. Emboldened by the Trump administration, U.S. tech companies are more powerful than ever, and President Donald Trump has rolled back a Biden-era executive order meant to safeguard civil rights from new surveillance technologies. As the capacity and sophistication of such technologies has grown, so has their reach. Surveillance technologies now include AI systems that help track and detain migrants in the U.S. and identify people to kill in the Israel-Hamas war. China, in the meantime, has used what it learned from the U.S. to turn itself into a surveillance superpower, selling technologies to countries like Iran and Russia.

“Because of this technology … we have no freedom at all,” said Yang Caiying, now in exile in Japan, whose family has been trapped in an increasingly tight noose of surveillance for the past 16 years. “At the moment, it’s us Chinese that are suffering the consequences, but sooner or later, Americans and others, too, will lose their freedoms.”

Sustainable supply chains don’t just reduce emissions—they also cut costs and increase efficiency.
They point to the kind of measurable impact businesses can achieve when sustainability is embedded across operations and supply chains.
Supply chain transformation To achieve this kind of shift, Capgemini proposes a three-pillar framework: sustainable product design, sustainable manufacturing and sustainable supply chains.
The third pillar - supply chains - is especially crucial, as it deals directly with logistics, procurement and supplier relationships.","With rising greenhouse gas emissions threatening to derail global climate targets and uncertainty mounting from political tensions and cost pressures, supply chains sit at the centre of a growing storm.

According to Capgemini's Building Sustainable Value Chains report, the industrial sector alone contributes over 35% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Most of this, around 70%, stems from Scope 3 emissions, which are those that come from the wider value chain including suppliers and customers.

Capgemini warns that unless action is taken, emissions could push global temperatures up by between 4.1°C and 4.8°C by 2100. This far overshoots the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the increase below 2°C, ideally 1.5°C.

Yet, there’s opportunity in the challenge. Sustainable transformation offers cost reduction, resilience to disruption and long-term competitiveness - and for businesses looking to protect themselves from market shocks, getting supply chains in order may be the most effective place to start.

Supply chains and the problem with Scope 3

Decarbonisation, especially of Scope 3 emissions, proves to be a persistent stumbling block.

Half of the businesses Capgemini surveyed admit they are off-track in addressing Scope 3. Two-thirds say they lack confidence in delivering a fully developed roadmap.

Why? Because measuring and managing emissions beyond a company’s own operations is complex and resource-intensive.

There are several hurdles; businesses struggle to build a clear case for long-term investment in sustainability. Tracking and reporting emissions across suppliers remains patchy.

Supply chains, especially across multiple geographies, are difficult to decarbonise. Low-carbon technologies, meanwhile, are often hard to scale.

Different sectors also face different pressures. Industries such as steel, cement and mining see most of their emissions in Scope 1, which covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. But in electronics, food and chemicals, the bulk lies in Scope 3. This means decarbonising requires coordination between manufacturers, suppliers and retailers.

“Building a sustainable value chain is an iterative process,” say Cyril Garcia, Group Executive Board Member and Head of Sustainability at Capgemini and Charlotte Pierron-Perlès, Global Head of Intelligent Industry, Capgemini Invent, in the report.

“It requires a balanced approach between short-term quick wins, such as energy efficiency and sustainable product design improvements and long-term action, such as strategising on the product portfolio, sustainable asset investment and supply chain re-design.”

Less emissions, more efficiency

Despite the barriers, Capgemini sets out a clear business case. Sustainable supply chains don’t just reduce emissions—they also cut costs and increase efficiency.

The report includes a number of examples. One packaging company redesigned its product using life-cycle assessment, lowering the carbon footprint per unit from 10 kgCO₂e to 3 kgCO₂e. At the same time, it managed to reduce production costs. A car manufacturer brought down Scope 1 emissions by 27% and Scope 2 by 13% across 17 sites.

Circular models prove especially powerful. In water and automotive sectors, circular systems yield material savings of up to 50% and cost reductions as high as 70%.

A heavy industry client uses digital twins, virtual replicas of physical processes, alongside AI to cut kiln energy use by 15% and shorten development cycles by 70%.

These aren’t isolated wins. They point to the kind of measurable impact businesses can achieve when sustainability is embedded across operations and supply chains.

Supply chain transformation

To achieve this kind of shift, Capgemini proposes a three-pillar framework: sustainable product design, sustainable manufacturing and sustainable supply chains. The third pillar - supply chains - is especially crucial, as it deals directly with logistics, procurement and supplier relationships.

Under this model, businesses prioritise responsible sourcing, logistics optimisation and ESG transparency. These steps reduce dependency on vulnerable resources and prepare businesses for disruption.

Capgemini highlights “transversal enablers” that support all three pillars. These include traceability tools, digital product passports and automated systems to evaluate carbon footprints across extensive product catalogues.

Digitalisation plays a critical role here. Data systems, digital twins and AI offer predictive modelling, real-time decision-making and enhanced traceability.

For example, one manufacturer with 8,000 suppliers and 350,000 product references uses an automated carbon footprint system to map out a complete decarbonisation roadmap.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f1253fa537d2419ea109e8dc9f7a8286:84fcac6d781659f435d0549f621b556d/capgemini-main.webp.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:23:42.109901

Mirror and Express publisher to axe 321 jobs

The owner of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express has announced plans to axe 321 journalism jobs as part of a major editorial overhaul.

Reach, which also owns the Daily Star and several regional titles, has put 600 editorial jobs at risk, in what it says is its biggest ever restructure.

The latest cull adds to around 40 redundancies across its sports editorial team, which were announced in July.

Staff affected by the cuts were informed on Monday.

Retail sales up 3.1% last month

Retail sales were up 3.1% in August, driven in part by good weather and an interest rate cut, new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show.

Computer and mobile phone sales performed well ahead of the return to school, with food sales also increasing.

New school clothing and footwear did not sell as well as expected as some families opted for second-hand alternatives, the BRC said.

But it warned that retail sales could dip in the following months.

""With the later-than-expected Budget falling just days before Black Friday, many are uneasy about how consumer confidence and spending could be impacted by tax rise speculation in the run-up to Christmas,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.

Water firms hit with £86m fines

Two water firms have been hit with fines totalling more than £86m over failures linked to sewage spills.

Anglian Water will have to pay £62.5m and South West Water will pay £24m towards benefiting the environment and their customers, regulator Ofwat said.

Lynn Parker, senior director for enforcement at Ofwat, said: ""These are serious breaches and are unacceptable.

""We are pleased both companies have accepted that they got things wrong and are now focusing on putting that right, and taking action to come back into compliance.""

The UK is badly exposed to illegal meat smuggling, according to a new parliamentary report.

The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) Committee said that it was ""by luck rather than design"" that the UK had so far avoided a ""major disease outbreak"".

It warned: ""Alarming amounts of meat and dairy products are now being illegally imported to Great Britain for both personal consumption and sale.

""""Criminal smuggling operations are largely responsible for this and are bringing in products of some of the greatest risk.""

It said prohibited products were entering the country by plane, boat, cars and in parcels.

In some cases, it said meat is arriving ""stashed in plastic bags, suitcases and cardboard boxes"".

""This meat is finding its way to our high streets, farms, markets, restaurants and kitchen tables, demand driven by the cost-of-living crisis as well as cultural preferences,"" it added.

The report said that there was no clear data showing the scale of the smuggling.

While it welcomed a government ban in April on most meat and dairy imports from the EU, it warned that the enforcement of it was ""toothless"".

Our Money feature writer Brad Young recently explored how the UK would feed itself in a crisis, and found it was ""criminally"" unprepared...

Barclays is cutting the interest rate on two of its popular savings accounts on Friday.

The bank is reducing the rate on its Reward Saver from 2.25% AER to 2.1% AER, while its Blue Rewards Saver, which comes with a £5 monthly fee, will drop from 2.91% to 2.75%.

The interest rate applies to the accounts when no withdrawals are made in a given month, otherwise a lower interest rate of 0.6% AER applies.

Several banks have been cutting interest rates in recent weeks, after the Bank of England reduced its base rate from 4.25% to 4%.

While this is good news for borrowers, for savers it means a dip in the amount they can earn on their stashed away cash.

If you have one of the latest Barclays accounts to see a cut, here's what you could do...

Savings expert Anna Bowes, from The Private Office, says the rates offered by the Barclays accounts are already ""highly uncompetitive"" and the reduction makes them worse.

""There is no need to wait until the rate cut to find a better paying account. The rates currently on offer can easily be beaten - and with no restriction on the number of withdrawals,"" she says.

The best paying easy access account available is with Chase, though this is only available to new Chase customers, joining since 9 June.

The rate is 4.75% AER - considerably more than the rates offered by Barclays both before and after the new rates are applied.

For those who do not want to open a new current account, and do not want restricted access to their cash, Bowes says Cahoot's Simple Saver is paying more.

It is paying 4.4% AER, but after 12 months your money will be moved to a cahoot Savings Account paying a far lower rate (currently 1% AER), she warns.

Santander is paying 6% AER on its Edge Saver account, but only on balances of up to £4,000, and this rate includes a 2% variable rate bonus for 12 months.

""More importantly, you have to be an Edge Current Account customer, which comes with a £3 monthly fee to be aware of,"" Bowes says.

Up to 30 million people could be eligible for compensation under the UK financial watchdog's motor finance redress scheme, its boss has said.

Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said he hoped compensation could start being paid next year.

It comes after the FCA found many car finance firms broke the law or its rules by not properly informing customers about commission paid by lenders to the car dealers that sold them the loan.

Motorists who bought cars on finance between 2007 and 2021 could be eligible for the compensation.

""During the period that we're looking it - from 2007 through to approximately 2020 - there are around 30 million agreements... and all of those will be eligible for compensation,"" he said.

""One of the things that we are looking at very closely is what the scope of the scheme will be.""

He said the FCA was looking into so-called discretionary commission arrangements, of which there were about 14.6 million over the same period.

Under ""discretionary commission arrangements"", brokers and dealers charged higher levels of interest so they could receive more commission, without telling consumers.

""A very significant proportion of those agreements... we do think probably breached the law when it came to disclosure and, by extension, unfair relationships,"" Rathi said.

He told a group of MPs on the Treasury Committee that the FCA was consulting on an industry-wide compensation scheme because there was ""evidence that there have been unfair relationships between lenders and their consumers"".

He said a ""large number of consumers were not properly informed"" about the interest rate on their motor finance deal.

The consultation is due to be launched by early October.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that motorists would not be able to claim compensation for hidden commissions paid on car loans, which narrowed the scope for the people who would be eligible for a payout.

After the ruling, the FCA said it would consult on what issues would make a driver eligible for compensation in a redress scheme.

While it's looking at hidden commissions, it is also looking at other commission agreements that could mean lenders have charged unfair amounts to customers.

We look at who might be eligible for the payment under the redress scheme if it goes ahead...

You can get a £1 pizza at Pizza Express this month.

At the popular chain, customers can get a £1 classic or Leggera pizza when they buy other classic or Leggera pizza at full price.

Prices differ across the country, but are typically between £11 and £20.

The offer is available until 28 September for eat in, collection or delivery via Pizza Express.

It isn't available for orders through delivery platforms such as Just Eat, Uber Eats and Deliveroo.

Under the terms and conditions, the most expensive pizza on the bill cannot be discounted to £1 and Pizza Express's airport locations do not qualify either.

The chain is running a similar offer for its Romana pizzas until 28 September - buy one for full price and get a second for £2.95.

Using a work computer for personal matters, such as shopping or looking for properties, for less than 45 minutes a day is not a sackable offence, a judge has ruled.

An accountancy firm employee has won £14,120 after an employment tribunal ruled the time she spent browsing sites such as Rightmove or Amazon was not excessive.

Named in court documents as Ms A Lanuszka, the worker was sacked in July 2023 after spyware was placed on her computer to record her activity and found she had been using it for personal reasons.

Over 13 and 14 July, she was found to have spent 2 hours and 33 minutes on the computer, of which one hour and 24 minutes was on ""personal matters"" and 1 hour and nine minutes on work matters.

Michael Magee, the judge, said there was ""no prohibition on personal computer use, and the amount of time Ms Lanuszka devoted to personal matters during the two days has not been shown to be excessive"".

He found that Ms Lanuszka's boss, named as Ms Krauze, had also used a work computer for personal reasons, and that no policies were shown to her indicating that she should not do so.

""She was free to use the computer personally when work commitments permitted and during breaks,"" he said.

He also noted that she used the computer to improve her skills. For example, she completed Excel training and used Groupmania to ""improve her use of spreadsheets and presentations"".

He ruled that Ms Lanuszka's boss wanted to dismiss her before she had accrued two years service - the point at which workers are able to bring an unfair dismissal claim against their employer.

""The tribunal concludes that it was Ms Krauze's desire to dismiss Ms Lanuszka before Ms Krauze believed that she would accrue two years' service that was the real reason for Ms Lanuszka's dismissal and not conduct,"" he said.

Mitchum has apologised after customers developed ""painful"" and ""itchy"" rashes under their arms while using its deodorants.

It has told those experiencing the ""irritation"" to stop using the affected products ""immediately"".

Shoppers have been posting videos and photos of their sore armpits on TikTok and X after using some of the brand's roll-on deodorants.

Some assumed it was down to an ingredient change, but Mitchum has clarified the issue is due to ""a change in the manufacturing process"" of one of its raw materials.

""Some of you told us that you have experienced temporary irritation after using selected batches of Mitchum 48-hour 100ml roll on, sold in the UK, Ireland and South Africa,"" it said on Instagram. ""We are sorry to those who were impacted and for the time it took to complete the investigation.""

Angry customers were quick to reply to the Instagram post, with some disappointed by the statement.

""Temporary irritation is an absolute joke, irritation is not the word. Try burns, blisters, scabs, now scars. I'll never buy another Mitchum product again,"" one said.

""I don't think red raw underarms that are burning and peeling is accurately depicted by your phrasing of 'temporary irritation',"" said another.

Mitchum said the manufacturing change ""altered how the product interacts with the skin"" for some people.

""The change didn't meet our standards, or yours. We've gone back to the original process to make sure current and future batches meet the high standards you expect,"" it added.

Not all batches have been affected by the issue, and you can tell if your deodorant has been by checking the batch number at the bottom of the bottle.

These are the products that have been affected:

No other products in the brand's portfolio are affected by the issue.

Mitchum told Money the issue had been resolved and it was working to remove the ""small amount of product remaining on shelf"".

""We ask that any consumers experiencing issues contact our Customer Care team and give us a chance to make this right,"" the spokesman added.

“We advise those experiencing issues to stop using the product immediately and to contact our teams at customerenquiries@mitchum.com or on 0800 085 2716.""

We'll take a look at France, after the collapse of prime minister Francois Bayrou's government, in a moment.

But first, news of a big deal for a FTSE 100 company.

Anglo American, the mining firm, had been at the centre of takeover interest for many years.

But it has moved to end that saga by announcing a merger with Teck Resources, a Canadian rival.

Under the terms, Anglo will own about 62.4% of the newly combined company.

It will be called Anglo Teck. Crucially for the UK, it will continue to have its primary stock market listing in London though it will be headquartered in Canada.

Anglo shares were up 7% in early trading as a result of the deal and leading tentative gains on the FTSE 100.

The index was 0.2% up at 9,242.

Across the Channel, markets are calm in France despite the political turmoil of the night before.

It was confirmed after markets in Europe had closed that Bayrou was to formally resign this morning after losing a confidence vote in the National Assembly that was tied to his plan for £40bn of budget cuts.

It leaves France in political limbo again, with President Emmanuel Macron under pressure to agree new parliamentary elections.

A succession of minority governments have toppled in recent years, with Macron supporters unable to get crucial legislation past a split Assembly.

The CAC 40 was 0.6% up this morning, recovering some losses of recent weeks, and French government borrowing costs were stable, as was the euro.

The calm could easily be replaced if no way forward is found and investors start to question the country's ability to operate effectively.

Move aside Tesco, and get out of the way Waitrose, Pret A Manger is entering the meal deal market.

In a bid to boost lunchtime trade after sustaining heavy losses last year, the coffee chain is rolling out the popular main, snack and drink combo in the final three months of the year.

Boss Pano Christou said the company's priority would be ""offering great value for money"" as it looks to grow the brand and return to sustainable profits.

While it sounds great, it's hard to judge at the moment because we don't know how much it's going to cost, and where it will launch.

At the moment, Pret's range of sandwiches cost between £2.99 and £6.25.

Cold drinks range in price between £1.80 and £4.80. Some of the snacks listed on the website include salt and cider vinegar crisps, dark chocolate corn cakes and dried mango.

Pret suffered heavy losses last year because of non-cash impairments linked to a reassessment of the company by owner JAB, which bought the chain in 2018.

What do supermarkets offer?

Major supermarkets, such as Tesco, have offered meal deals including sandwiches, snacks and drinks for years.

Tesco recently increased the price of its meal deal by 25p as food inflation affects the sector.

Waitrose has the most expensive deal at £5.

Sainsbury's recently increased its price by 20p to £3.95.

Morrisons customers pay £4, the same as Co-op non-members - though members pay £3.50.

Asda doesn't offer a fixed price for its meal deal, instead operating a 3-for-2 system, with the cheapest item free.",https://e3.365dm.com/25/09/1600x900/skynews-money-blog-deoderant_7015066.jpg?20250909111531,N,,2025-09-09 15:17:25.316840

Comerica executives are “taking a hard look at expenses,” CEO Curt Farmer said Tuesday, as the lender has faced activist investor pressure to sell.

Farmer flagged expenses related to real estate, headcount, technology and third parties as areas the Dallas-based company may trim, as it works to improve its efficiency ratio. When giving 2026 guidance during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January, executives may be “looking for opportunities to lean in a little bit heavier on the expense side than we have year-to-date,” Farmer said at a Barclays investor conference.

“The No. 1 priority of both management and our board is to protect and grow shareholder value,” Farmer said. “That’s our duty to our shareholders, and we and the board take it very seriously.”

Dive Insight:

In late July, HoldCo Asset Management, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based investment firm that owns 1.8% of Comerica stock, called on the $78 billion-asset lender to sell itself to a larger bank, accusing Comerica of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.”

HoldCo put forth PNC, Fifth Third and Huntington as potential buyers that could make sense. Should Comerica not pursue a sale, HoldCo intends to nominate five directors to the bank’s 11-person board, possibly in December, The Wall Street Journal reported this month, citing unnamed sources.

At the Barclays conference Tuesday, executives stressed their commitment to improving the bank’s performance.

“Our main focus remains on levering this robust franchise to enhance profitability and drive value, and we believe our strategic positioning and strong balance sheet give us the engine and flexibility to meet the demands ahead of us,” Farmer said.

Farmer noted he, CFO Jim Herzog and Kelly Gage, director of investor relations, have met with shareholders over the past 45 days, and long-term shareholders acknowledge “all the things they like about Comerica, but they also acknowledge that we need to improve our performance metrics.”

“We know it’s all about execution,” he said. “Myself and the board hold ourselves accountable to that high standard.”

Asked about considerations around joining another organization, Farmer said “we fully appreciate that this is an environment where there’s always speculation about M&A across our industry,” and Comerica executives seek to manage for the long term.

“We are going to execute on the plan we’ve got, but also be aware of the landscape,” Farmer said.

The bank’s efficiency ratio was about 66% for the second quarter. The metric is found by dividing a bank’s noninterest expense by the sum of noninterest income and net interest income. A higher ratio suggests a bank is less efficient.

During the company’s most recent earnings call, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo criticized Comerica’s efficiency ratio, asking Farmer why the lender had earned the right to remain independent.

Farmer acknowledged Tuesday the bank’s efficiency ratio is high, “which we continue to believe is a bit more on the revenue challenge than on the expense challenge, but, having said that, we’re looking at every lever that we possibly can to improve that efficiency ratio and ultimately improve [return on equity],” Farmer said. “That includes a hard look at expenses.”

That review is underway now, he indicated. That might include real estate: Comerica has closed about 50 banking centers and “done a fair amount of rationalization of our portfolio” in the past couple of years, “but there’s always more opportunities,” Farmer said.

Comerica had 353 branches as of June 30, compared to 379 as of Sept. 30, 2024. The bank had about 7,565 employees as of the end of last year.

The bank’s management seeks to whittle expenses, Farmer said, but “we want to do that, though, in a way that protects some of the revenue things that we’re working on.”

That includes Comerica’s efforts to offset the loss of the Treasury Department’s Direct Express prepaid-card program, by adding more small-business deposits, and chasing embedded finance opportunities that tap the bank’s payments and treasury capabilities, he said.

“We’re trying to figure out that right balance,” between improving the bank’s performance in the short term, and driving revenue growth longer term, Farmer said. Other revenue-boosting efforts involve investments in the bank’s wealth management and capital markets businesses.

Comerica continues to manage the Direct Express program, he said; accounts have not yet migrated although the Treasury’s move to BNY has been announced. Direct Express average deposits in the second quarter were $3.7 billion.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/f76WAXV1yR1uqfTech2kCnMszrlw1FsaFn3uTKwf1Xw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9jb21lcmljYXNpZ24yLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-09 18:16:37.259054

Even as Kraft Heinz prepares to split in two, its flagship ketchup is doubling down on brand swagger. The company is launching “Looks Familiar,” a global campaign that argues Heinz has become so iconic that even fast-food fry boxes mimic its keystone label.

Created by Rethink, the effort leans into the french fry as ketchup’s ultimate sidekick. French fries are the most-ordered item worldwide on Uber Eats and appear on about half of all restaurant menus. The campaign invites consumers to connect the dots: if the fries come in a keystone-shaped box, they belong with Heinz.

The work also builds on Heinz’s ongoing partnership with Uber Eats. Consumers can now make sure fries arrive with Heinz ketchup through the app, and in select markets can score promotions like half-off a bottle of Heinz. In Los Angeles, participating Carl’s Jr. locations are offering free fries and Heinz ketchup with orders over $30, while supplies last.

“While the insight behind this global idea is a simple one, the Heinz brand’s connection to fries is iconic and universal,” said Nina Patel, vice president, global Heinz brand, in the announcement. “No matter where you are in the world, ‘Looks Familiar’ spotlights the truth that famous fry boxes everywhere are shaped just like our distinctive signature keystone — proving that fries don’t just need any ketchup, they need Heinz.”

The campaign is running in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Brazil, Germany, UAE and China, supported by out-of-home, long-form video, digital shoppable integrations, paid social and earned media. It follows 2023’s “It Has to Be Heinz,” the first unified global brand strategy in the company’s 150-year history, and quirky PR stunts like Heinz-verified Uber Eats listings and even ketchup smoothies.

The timing also underscores why Kraft Heinz is betting its growth on condiments. In last week’s announced breakup, Heinz ketchup and other sauces will anchor a new company focused on global growth. Slower-moving grocery staples, including Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables, will be relegated to a North America-focused spin-off. That split ends a 10-year merger that consistently disappointed investors — and puts more pressure on Heinz to keep proving its label is still the one that matters.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/09/09/image001_XW5qzf7.png,N,,2025-09-09 13:25:52.898627

And creativity – often overlooked in retail media – is a priority, powered by a 77,000-square-foot in-house ad agency.
Experiences as the edge What sets Best Buy apart, Valentino argued, is its footprint: 1,000 stores and 100m members.","“When you want to be a media company, you have to position yourself at the intersection of technology and culture,” she said. For Best Buy, that means moving beyond selling gadgets to shaping the cultural moments those gadgets power – from gaming launches to holiday shopping.

From misperception to momentum

Retail media may feel like the hot new thing, but as Valentino pointed out, Best Buy has “been at this for a decade.” Last year alone, the retailer ran campaigns with 600 brands. The turning point came this summer with Nintendo’s Switch 2 pre-order launch, which broke records and even brought back midnight openings.

“Nearly 60% of all online orders for this device were picked up in store. We created a cultural moment around the unboxing. It was huge,” she said. That lightning-in-a-bottle moment convinced her there’s a far bigger opportunity in blending buzz with data-driven solutions.

Lessons from the front line

Valentino outlined three big lessons Best Buy is leaning into:

Solutions, not slots. “It’s really about selling solutions – understanding at a customer level what they’re trying to accomplish.”

Standardization or bust. With more than 200 retail media networks crowding the market, she warned, “If we don’t standardize, the flight to consolidation will just happen very rapidly. Coca-Cola can’t buy 200 versions of anything.”

Operate at tech speed. “We need to be in a mindset that we are a startup – that we are shipping code every 30 days.”

Inside Best Buy Ads

Much of the future rests on automation and self-service. The retailer has launched a programmatic platform capable of working with “thousands of customers, not hundreds.” Measurement is being overhauled with new forecasting and optimization tools. And creativity – often overlooked in retail media – is a priority, powered by a 77,000-square-foot in-house ad agency.

“We ran 3,000 campaigns last year and made all of them from a creative standpoint. Nobody knows the customer better than Best Buy,” she noted.

Experiences as the edge

What sets Best Buy apart, Valentino argued, is its footprint: 1,000 stores and 100m members. That scale unlocks collaborations with brands from Meta to Ikea and pilots for in-store “takeovers” that blur the line between retail and entertainment.

“What an opportunity to build experiences around that kind of physical presence. Nintendo taught us a lot this summer, but there’s a lot more to come.”

Why it matters for marketers

For other marketers, the takeaway is clear: retail media is no longer just about clicks and conversions. It’s about building cultural relevance, standardizing where possible and moving with the speed of technology.

Or as Valentino put it: “Not all good ideas have to be yours. Sometimes the biggest leap forward is collaboration.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/news/356910/lisa_valentino.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-09-09 13:24:05.776331

Why It Matters

Burkholderia cepacia complex organisms are environmental bacteria that can be harmless in many people, but cause serious infections in people with weakened immune systems or chronic lung disease.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and DermaRite say the contamination could lead to local infections in otherwise healthy users with broken skin and to bloodstream infections, or deadly sepsis in immunocompromised patients—outcomes that may require hospitalization and carry substantial risk.

What To Know

The recall was initiated by DermaRite on July 16 and expanded on August 27, with Walmart issuing its own list of impacted Sam's Club stores on Monday.

DermaRite's expansion covers a broad list of skincare and hygiene products, including but not limited to: 4-N-1 No Rinse Wash Cream, DermaCerin, DermaFungal, DermaKleen, DermaMed, DermaSarra, Gel Rite hand sanitizer, Hand E Foam, KleenFoam, Lantiseptic, PeriGiene, PeriGuard, Renew Dimethicone & Renew Periprotect, Renew Skin Repair and UltraSure antiperspirant/deodorant.

According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, 92 percent of all automotive organizations predict that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM) services.

SDM key focus areas for OEMs

The report titled ‘The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles’, reveals that over eight in ten manufacturers believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition. However, only a few manufacturers have been able to scale their developments to their fullest capacity in this direction.

It has come to light that in 2025, fewer than half of automotive organizations had scaled their SDM initiatives — with 34 percent partially scaling at least one use case and only 14 percent reaching full-scale deployment. “For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,” said Laurence Noël, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini.

Artificial Intelligence: New Area of Innovation

Artificial intelligence (AI) will be the new area of innovation for auto OEMs across the world. The Capgemini report highlights a staggering 85 percent of manufacturers believe that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software. Soon, AI will be directly integrated into software features and functions that will help improve in-vehicle experiences, power advanced safety features and cybersecurity, etc.

Around 77 percent automakers feel that AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services will give them a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. This will also help OEMs reduce costs, boost productivity and efficiency, and enhance product quality, and therefore, scale profitability.

Most of the organizations surveyed for this report, view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization’s software-driven strategy. This suggests the industry will help develop more advanced autonomous driving technologies in the coming years.

Organizational overhaul on cards

According to the survey, 86 percent manufacturers believe implementation of SDM demands an overhaul of the organizational model, leading to significant changes in processes, and the need to build new skill sets. Besides structural transformations, organizations encounter significant challenges in areas such as software engineering, compliance, safety, cybersecurity, leadership, and talent acquisition.

Notably, 83% of organizations consider the development of a unified software platform to be a critical element of their software-driven mobility strategy. Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs.The report concludes that total revenue for OEMs is projected to double, with SDMs contributing to over 50 percent by 2035.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/09/Software-driven-mobility.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 13:24:12.896719

Full transcript - Barclays 23rd Annual Global Financial Services Conference:

Jason, Analyst: Moving right along. I’m very pleased to have U.S. Bancorp with us from the company, Gunjan Kedia, CEO. Became CEO in April of this year, so not that long ago. John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, thank you for being with us. We’ll put up the first ARS question that we’ve been asking all the companies. Gunjan, maybe start with you. You know, five months on the job, certainly as CEO. Maybe just start off by catching us up on what you’ve been up to since mid-April. Key lessons learned so far in your new role?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: It’s been a privilege to step into the role of the CEO of a wonderful company, and thank you for having us. I think we have passed over the fire alarm, a good sign. Jason, as I stepped into my role five months back now, we had come off of two years of quite intense focus, first on the Union Bank integration and then on building the capital back up again. This time last year, we had built on that and articulated financial targets for the medium term. That was the context in which I had stepped into my role, and I articulated three key priorities to achieve our medium-term financial targets, and that was expense stabilization, organic growth, and payments transformation.

Your question on what I’ve been up to for the last five months has really been putting in place a very talented leadership team, not just at my level but a level below, and rewiring the organization for more urgent execution. That’s sort of been my focus for five months. I’ll tell you, as I have spent an enormous amount of time listening to all our stakeholders, I am very encouraged by how well our brand and our culture resonates with our clients. Our thesis that we have enormous opportunities to deepen these client relationships by interconnecting our products is very strong and real. I’ve also spent a lot of time with our investors, and there we have some work to do to just consistently deliver.

Unidentified speaker: I’ve been investigating the cause. If the cause is in terror, you’ll be notified. May I be a passenger, please? May I be a passenger, please? An alarm has been resumed. We’re investigating the cause. If the cause has been in terror, you’ll be notified.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I think we’re safe because if the hotel was burning, we’d be being rushed out.

Jason, Analyst: Good. I guess as a follow-up to that, you talked about these three strategic priorities for the near term. Maybe you can just update us on those and the kind of the progress you’ve made.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah. The first one is expenses, and we are really in very strong shape there. We’ve now reported seven straight quarters of stable expenses, and that has allowed us, Jason, to both deliver our positive operating leverage targets and invest into organic growth. We have runway with expenses. That program is executing very well, so we’re in very, very strong shape there. The second priority was organic growth. Our fee growth trends are strengthening quarter by quarter, so we are very pleased there. What’s very important to us is how the mix has evolved over time. We are really a fee-heavy franchise.

We were at about 42% last quarter, and it’s very balanced across these three pillars: payments, which has been a historical overweight on fees, our trust in investments and capital market-related fees, which we are really doubling down on growing, and then consumer fees, which remain strong, but we don’t have as much dependence on them because they’re more volatile and have some regulatory pressures. The fee growth story is coming along very, very nicely. Last quarter, we took some substantial actions to reposition our balance sheet, so that has set us up for much better NII growth. Organic growth feels well underway as well. The third priority is payments transformation. We’re very differentiated. Our payments franchise is quite unique and quite difficult to replicate either through acquisition or organic growth elsewhere. We are focused on transformative strategies there.

We have two leaders for two parts of the business, and they are executing to that agenda. We feel very good. We measure our success on those three priorities by our medium-term targets, and quarter after quarter, the progress we are making. As you saw last quarter, we’re just really, really delivering strong progress there.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Maybe put up the next ARS question. I guess as a follow-up to what you just said, you mentioned organic growth and expense management, both strategic priorities. You mentioned seven straight quarters of stable expenses, which I guess on one hand is good. On the other hand, I don’t know, any kind of impact on revenue growth from kind of focusing sort of expenses? Just how do you balance the two?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah. We’re not at a point when we need to balance the two because the expense stabilization is not a matter of trade-offs right now for us. It’s very much real productivity. Jason, you’ve been following us for a long time. You know we have spent an extraordinary amount of investment dollars for the last five or six years in building out a wide array of digital capabilities. That gives you a lot of opportunities to drive real productivity. Most of these capabilities are being adopted. The operating processes around them are being designed to drive productivity. You add to it some of the new tools available, like AI, like transformative. I thought he was going to come on.

Unidentified speaker: The cause of the alarm has been determined to be a broken pipe in our garage of the hotel. Sorry for the inconvenience. May I be a passenger, please? May I be a passenger, please? The cause of the alarm has been determined to be caused by a broken pipe in our garage of the hotel. The elements will be back momentarily.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: If any of you have a card in the garage and you need to run right out, we will fully understand and not take it personally. The expense question, let me keep plowing on here. It is very real, and I don’t think you need to worry at all about the trade-offs. In fact, we are generating enough expense savings that not only are we delivering sort of a stable trajectory, we are investing a fair amount, and you’ll see that show up in various business lines as well.

Jason, Analyst: I guess one of the things that we learned in Ambassador Day was spending about $2.5 billion a year on investments. Have we kind of reached a tipping point there? Where is most of these investments going? Is it more offensive to drive growth, more defensive? How should we think about that?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah. Just to piggyback off of what Gunjan just said, the tech investments are a very important story for us in terms of our spend levels. That level you cited, $2.5 billion, is our annual run rate that we spend. The sweet spot for us in a couple of different paths, Jason, because on one hand, it’s two-thirds offense, one-third defense, to use the words you used, offensively to create products, enhancements, and things of that variety, defensively to have system maintenance and the like. The other part of it is that cost is embedded in our run rate. Part of the reason that we have had this seven quarters of flattish expense and working on an eighth is that we have these opportunities to invest in the business and get that productivity that Gunjan mentioned. We’re really focused on a number of different areas. We’re focused on simple architecture.

How do we utilize the cloud to help our mainframe and hollowing out the core and all those sorts of things? The second thing is about product development and making sure we have all the right digital apps and capabilities available to us. The third that is really a differentiator for us is the reusability. We think the reusability of technology is a very important concept. We use it a lot in our businesses, such as Elan, such as our co-brand, our partnerships with State Farm, with Ed Jones, those sorts of things. A long way of saying this is the long-term investments we’re making in technology is helping that productivity, and it’s a meaningful player in how we’re gaining positive operating leverage going forward.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Can I add one other point, Jason, to it? There was a time five or six years back when we really needed to focus on the digital capabilities and that $2.5 billion of capital expense was very important. I also want to point out we invest a lot of operating expense into growing our franchise. Just to build off of what has already been built, you will see us investing more in sales, marketing, building brand, building distribution presence, being more front-footed with partnerships. There are lots and lots of ways of investing in growth on top of the $2.5 billion, which was very specifically focused on an agenda of catching up and surpassing really the quality of the digital products and capabilities we had.

Jason, Analyst: I guess maybe just talk to payments. It’s like a quarter of the revenue, so clearly a differentiator versus other regional banks. We haven’t seen consistent year-over-year growth that we’d expect from some of those businesses. Maybe just update us in terms of your payments transformation progress and what we’d expect to see there.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I’ll start. Let me start with our sort of strategic commitment to the payments, which is very strong. We think of it in two ways. One, it’s a standalone, very attractive product set in a growth business for us, very high returns, fee-oriented. It’s also the first set of products that today’s young customer uses to interact with the financial services system. If you think about how our kids, they don’t start with a checking account necessarily. Years before that, they’ve started using some kind of a payments mechanism, a P2P vehicle, or a credit card. We have this view that in the fullness of time, as you’re trying to evolve your client franchise to a Gen Z or a different type of audience, the payments products will become the more real anchor point of loyalty, longevity, more frequent connection with the bank.

Our philosophy is payments need to both be embedded in every other product set we have as a way of interacting day-to-day with our clients and be a business unit that delivers very good financial returns. Deep commitment to the franchise. It is two very separate things. I’ll start with merchant because I have discovered that most people think of merchant when they’re thinking of payments. That’s about 6% to 7% of our revenue base, strategically very important to a small business franchise. The heart of the American economy is the small business, a very important segment for us. There, the transformative strategies are about narrowing our focus from what used to be a broad-based global acquiring-only horizontal business to a more software-led business that creates a lot more value, so less commodity. We’re focused on five verticals.

The reason for the focus is that these software capabilities are very unique to the needs of the end customer. You have to really think about their operating models and embed your payments products into their front office. You don’t want to be dilutive. These are five very large sectors of the economy. That focus is creating some very meaningful reacceleration of the business. More than a third of that business now is the software-led, and the growth rates there tend to be 5 to 10 times the rest of the acquiring-only business. The margins, the pricing holds up. The last thing I’ll say about merchant is I have heard from the investors some amount of misconceptions about the business. It is not an unprofitable business. It’s not a loss leader. We actually run it for a very high margin and very attractive set of margins.

Perhaps that is the trade-off with the volume growth that most people think about. The second thing is that business is one of the core beneficiaries of the build-out of the digital capabilities. We intend to continue investing in the business, but it’s in the run rate now. It’s neither a disproportionate user of profit margin or investment. Very sustainable franchise. It really anchors many, many parts of our banking franchise, and we’re deeply committed to that business. That’s sort of merchant. On the other side, we have the larger of the two businesses, which is a card issuing business. This is credit cards for small businesses, U.S. Bank, and Elan, which is our white-label platform for 1,200 small banks. Let me just start with Elan. Elan’s digital technology and product was materially upgraded and rolled out December of last year.

The user experience has skyrocketed from some very modest numbers to a very world-class experience. We have new leadership in place. We have built out that team. We expect that to really start to perform at much, much higher rates than the past. That’s one strategy. The bigger strategy is just the U.S. Bank branded cards. Historically, our product set was designed to drive loan growth because it was a balance sheet play. It’s a very attractive set of products for revolvers. Our loan growth there has been very attractive, at par or better than the industry. What we are doing now with this transformation is augmenting that with a new set of products that is equally attractive to transactors. Now we are competing not at the highest level of affluence and wealth, but really at the young affluent and connecting our banking products with our credit card products.

This is a suite of products called Smartly. As that rolls out, and these pipelines, we are seeing the increase in active accounts and the revenue follows, you know, four or five quarters after that. That build-up, and that’s the transformation to go from a revolver-heavy mindset to a revolver and transactor-heavy. Very good progress there, very differentiating franchise. You’ll see some real acceleration of that business over time.

Jason, Analyst: I guess maybe as an adjunct to that, stablecoin has been coming up throughout the conference. Do you think this could be a disruptor to the overall payment ecosystem? Just how you think about using them? I’d just love to get your perspective, given your kind of role in the payment space.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I always start by asking where the client need is because it’s a very fundamental way to think of prioritizing investments and focus. I will tell you, Jason, I’m hard-pressed to find one single client who’s saying, ""I just really need stablecoin from a bank right now."" The demand is not present and real with consumers. Where there’s interesting conversations is global corporates with cross-border payments. Most of the use cases are anchored around that. Most very large companies actually have very efficient cross-border payment systems because they are not feeling the big cost of cross-border payments. It really has become, in our minds, a new payment rail, one that we expect to participate in. We are expecting to pilot some limited edition stablecoin transactions yet this year. We are doing both a pilot U.S. Bancorp stablecoin and also a sort of a partner-led.

There’s quite a lot of capability available in the market to be able to do that quickly so that we are ready as and when the market develops. The underlying protocols of what the payment rail is going to look like is a collaborative effort in banking along with our industry partners. In many ways, it could be a more efficient disruptor of the institutional cross-border payments type of business, which is a very small footprint for us today, perhaps an opportunity for us going forward. What we really don’t see yet is a path either from a market structure or adoption with everyday retail payments, especially in the U.S., which is sort of our bread and butter. All I can say is it’s quite interesting. It’s a lot of conversation around it.

We are very front-footed in learning, in experimenting, and putting pilots out, but yet not seeing fully the economic models and how they might evolve.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. We’re at the halfway point, so I’m obligated to ask. Two weeks left to go in the quarter. John, I guess this is you.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah.

Jason, Analyst: You may provide us an update on kind of business loan growth trends. You know, what are you hearing from customers regarding the operating environment?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. When we look across the board, there’s just been a lot of activity, renewed activity, and it is very helpful from a loan growth perspective. We’ve seen, in particular, on the C&I front, M&A is picking up. Pipelines are strong. Small business loans are growing. Utilization rate is hanging in there. All the things are pointing to strength in the C&I categories. I would also say that payment trends continue to be strong. There’s a lot of payment activity, both on the consumer as well as on the business side of the equation. What I would say there is that the payment trends, particularly in the consumer, are helping loan growth there as well. Those are the positives. There are some components such as commercial real estate and auto loans that continue to drift a little lower.

All in, our loan growth should be in that industry HA data range. We are seeing that growth, which is positive. The other thing I would say is we are watching the employment situation. We’re watching the labor markets. We do acknowledge a softness, but importantly, the unemployment rate itself is favorable. There’s no concern from a credit standpoint as a result of it. The economy is resilient. Our clients are resilient, and we’re excited to see them pull through here as we look through the third quarter.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Compared to April, you know, right after the tariff discussion started, the mood has shifted, Jason, to sort of a sense that our clients can get their arms around what is happening. Some of the extreme caution that we saw in the April-May timeframe has given way to sort of more front-footedness with clients, so optimism there.

Jason, Analyst: I guess maybe before we delve further into the drivers, you guys give that earnings guidance slide in your deck. It’s kind of a bunch of 2025 and 325 topics. Does it all remain intact? You talked about revenue growth for the year growing at the lower end of up 3% to 5%. Is that still the right way to think about it? Any updates you want to provide?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. There’s no change to our guidance for the third quarter or for the full year, but maybe just to give some color to the third quarter, we gave a range of net interest income of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. We expect to be at the high end of that range given a number of different variables I can get into. The fees as well as expenses are coming in favorable as well and as expected for us. That all leads to very meaningful positive operating leverage for us in the third quarter. On the full year, as you mentioned, no change to that on the revenue guide, the 3% to 5% still intact and on the lower end, as you mentioned.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. All right, because if I guess if 3Q and AI fees and expenses are all doing a little bit better than expected, any chance we can get that revenue towards the middle of that 3% to 5%?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, I think the lower end is the appropriate amount, but importantly, we’re going to be in the high end of the range from a net interest income standpoint. A lot of it has to do with the favorability we’re seeing on the asset side. We’re seeing some of the strategic actions we took in the second quarter helping out in terms of the loan sale and the investment portfolio movements we did. The loan mix favorability is improving. I mentioned C&I loans and credit cards improving, and that’s really helping the mix side and yield side of the asset side of the equation. Our fixed asset repricing just continues to be favorable, a little bit more better than it was in the first half of the year. All those things kind of lead to the improvement we’re seeing on the NII side.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Maybe talk about deposits a little bit. Last quarter, you talked about some competitive pressures on the commercial front. Is that moderated? It kind of felt like that maybe U.S. Bancorp is a bit more than peers and just, I guess balances mix kind of what we’re seeing on that front.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. The deposit portfolio that we have, we feel very comfortable with it. We actually feel better about it now with rate cuts very much coming in in September here. It looks, you know, from a market standpoint, there’s going to be several cuts moving forward. That’s all beneficial to us. We benefit more from rates coming down and a steeper yield curve. That’s all coming together nicely. The one thing I would say about deposits is that if I just step back, we utilize deposits as a really important part in our client’s relationship. It really anchors those clients. When you get into situations like we did last quarter where there’s some competitiveness, we’re going to protect those sorts of deposit holders because they have multiple services and products with us.

That shows up in our fee categories such as corporate trust, fund services, treasury management, things of that variety. We’re not shy about the deposit profile. We still optimize it for cost, obviously, but we’re going to protect it from a relationship standpoint as well.

Jason, Analyst: I guess you touched on this, but you know, the Fed, I’m told, is going to cut next week and maybe, I would assume, again. You know, on the way up, you had one of the higher betas. As the Fed begins to cut, do you expect kind of the same beta as you laid out at Ambassador Day or just how you’re all thinking about that? This cycle has been a little bit different.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure.

Jason, Analyst: It’s like a nine-month pause.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Exactly. It’s been a very different cycle than when, you know, a year ago we were talking about all these sorts of things. When I was looking at our beta performance, I was actually pleasantly surprised. We were right from a peer group standpoint, we were on the upper end on the up-rate cycle. Actually, on this cycle heretofore, we’ve been on the upper end as well, or the better end of it as well. I think that’s a testament to the business model that we have and how we operate on our deposit side of things. I agree with you that the cycle is very different than what we would have said with the pause that we have here versus the three or four cuts that we had prior to last year.

If we get sustainable rate cuts from here on out, then we certainly see a path to getting to that beta that we talked about last year.

Jason, Analyst: Maybe put up the next ARS question. Right, no good deed goes unpunished. You pointed to the higher end of NII for the 3Q guide. I guess as senior citizens start to think about, you know, 2026, you’ve talked about this 3% NIM at some point. It was 2.66% in the second quarter. Maybe just talk to just, you know, how you’re thinking about next year, that NIM improvement story, and just how kind of rate cuts play into that.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, maybe just to start with the current quarters, we expect sequential growth here in the third quarter, as I mentioned, and the fourth quarter as well. We haven’t given guidance particularly specifically on 26%, 27%. However, given where we’re seeing the rate environment evolve to, we definitely see a path to getting to that 3% net interest margin in the 2027 area. That is where, and the speed in which we get there is really going to be dependent on what the cuts look like, what the curve looks like. Importantly, for us, more cuts in a sustained manner is beneficial, along with an upward sloping curve. I always look at SOFR versus the five-year Treasury. I think that’s an important data point for us and how our balance sheet is constructed. Those are kind of the puts and takes.

It’s really because we get the benefit of that fixed asset repricing that we’ve talked about. Our mix of assets are changing and improving to more higher growth, higher yielding in terms of card and/or commercial and industrial type loans. Those are the things that are going to benefit us as we move forward.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Maybe on the fee side, you know, Gunjan, you talked a lot about the payments businesses, but maybe there’s obviously other fee categories that have done that contribute to capital markets. For example, I think you’ve talked about mid-single-digit growth. I guess John maybe alluded to it a little bit better than that. Maybe just kind of flesh out the fee story.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: The premise of the fee acceleration is deepening our client relationships. Our approach here has been, Jason, to see where we are deploying balance sheets and sometimes deposits to support our client relationships. The relationships are healthy, and they would do more with us if the product sets were there. Those areas would point us to doubling down on expanding our capital markets capabilities. We are definitely underweight our fair share of that fee line relative to the size of the balance sheet. We expect to see some healthy growth there and very good progress there. Treasury management is another one that has seen very good growth, and that comes from just the product set having been strengthened quite materially over the last few years. We are seeing good growth in treasury management. California is beginning to deliver very nicely for us from a regional standpoint across all products.

Payments in particular has been a very consistent story of taking a very attractive, very affluent, very small business-focused customer base that we acquired from Union Bank and beginning to deepen there. That is a growth area. Partnerships where we’re very unique. We talked about Elan and how good we got with providing these white-label credit card services. With State Farm, we developed the banking multi-partner platform. Now with Edward Jones, we are standing that up. Many different products in terms of product expansion, but the bigger lever is really sort of deepening of the client relationships. The number that we shared was just above 40%. That number should be much higher given the strength of the brand and strength of the franchise. Those are the areas that you’d see publicly reported outside acceleration, but of course, internally, quite a lot of momentum in all categories.

Like trust and investments, just to give you, that fee category has done very consistently. The macroeconomic environment has been favorable and market share gains have been. That’s our private credit focus. We have a lot of conversations around the balance sheet growth parts of private credit, but with that comes a lot of our corporate trust business, a lot of our fund services business. That is sort of an interconnectivity at play right there. Another one is health care. Last year, we bought a small bolt-on acquisition called Salukro, which gave us some very good merchant capabilities. That’s been a traditional sector, very, very compatible with the bank’s culture and data privacy rules, and that creates momentum as well. Many, many areas of sort of driving fee growth.

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: One thing I might add as well is it’s in the other revenue category, but our impact finance business, which is really more about tax credit syndications, transferabilities, things of that variety. That has been a meaningful driver for fee growth as well. It’s in the other revenue category, so a little bit harder to see. We’ll try to provide some more color on that going forward.

Jason, Analyst: You talked about $3 billion for the second quarter and kind of this mid-single-digit growth target over time. Is that still the right way to think about it?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, on the fee side of the equation, yeah, mid-single digits is the way to think about it. It’s consistent with this year. It’s consistent with our medium-term targets.

Jason, Analyst: The other target you’ve talked about is kind of 200 basis points plus a positive operating leverage for this year. It feels like that’s intact, but just how do we think about that number, maybe looking out to next year as you kind of imagine beginning the 2026 budget process?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Let me begin.

Jason, Analyst: Yeah.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Jason, we are not really sort of managing to a specific positive operating leverage number. We are marching towards our medium-term target goals and stable expenses. As such, we expect that the positive operating leverage will be intact, as you say. The exact level will depend on revenue growth expectations. We are creating a sustainable, attractive EPS growth model. In certain cases, you might see us leaning in more into operating expenses to drive revenue growth. What we are very committed to is positive operating leverage without necessarily quoting a number. As long as it is accretive to a healthy, responsible EPS growth profile, we are happy to spend expenses as needed.

Jason, Analyst: I guess we’ve seen, as John alluded to, we’re going to say the eighth straight quarter of stable expenses. Do we see 12 straight quarters of stable expenses, or you’re okay to spend as long as the operating leverage is there?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Oh, we’re okay to spend as long as the operating leverage is there. We’re not trying to sort of get to 12 quarters of stable expenses. The expense takeout has just been sort of institutional productivity. We’ve gotten quite a lot of questions around whether we are sort of squeezing investments to get the expense ratios. I just want to say, at our size, we have considerable scale without the complexity in the businesses that we operate in. A lot of times, we are compared to these large global players. When you’re not in 100 regulatory environments where you’re trying to manage that kind of complexity, you should operate in what we think is a sustainable mid to high 50% efficiency ratio. That’s a business model assertion of ours. The expense flattening is important to get to balance in where we are going to be.

After that, we hope very much to drive the very diversified, very differentiated fee-intensive model that lends itself to good growth.

Jason, Analyst: Got it.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Third quarter.

Jason, Analyst: Yeah. Six minutes left, six questions. We’re going to go rapid fire here.

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: Agreed.

Jason, Analyst: Credit quality, it’s been stable. I guess any areas that we should be focused on?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: are really no areas. It’s stable. It’s improving in certain areas, so it’s quite stable. There’s not a lot of areas that give us any concern at this point. Trying to keep you on.

Jason, Analyst: Yeah, no, we’re good. I guess capital return, you know, share repurchase has been fairly modest. I think $100 million a quarter for the last several quarters, you know, a modest amount of earnings. Historically, you know, share rep buyback has been like 30% to 40% of earnings. Now it’s been like 5% of earnings. How do you kind of, is 30% to 40% still the right way to think about it longer term? Like when do you think we can get back there?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, from a policy standpoint and the way we think about capital return, ideally, we would like to be at 35% to 45% on dividend, 30% to 40%, as you mentioned, on the share repurchases. Right now, we’re right where we need to be on the dividend payout side. On the buyback, we’re on the lower end. We do aspire to get up to that level, but we’re still building capital to get to that category two level that we’ve been migrating toward. It’s been a two-year journey. We still have a little bit of kind of the last leg approaching here. As we approach that, we do intend to move that percentage up. How and when that occurs is going to depend on the macro and how loan growth is doing and all those other things that are important when you’re making these sort of decisions.

Jason, Analyst: Adjusted CET1 in the second quarter was 8.9%. Is there kind of a number you want to get to before you ramp up the buyback? You’ve actually taken a fair amount of actions to improve capital position. Is there more we could do there?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Sure. I think we’ve made considerable progress. We wanted from 8%, 9% to get to 10%. I think the buyback, back to your question, we’re going to eventually get to that 30% to 40% range as we move forward and march through time. Again, back to what I just mentioned, the timing of when that happens is just going to depend on loan growth, the macro, all those sorts of things. The intention is to glide back up into that realm once we get very close to our levels.

Jason, Analyst: Another use of capital is bank M&A. U.S. Bancorp has a long history of doing bank deals, albeit not recently. How do you think about the acquisition landscape? How does that play into the growth strategy?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I was reflecting on the audience survey on what’s the most important thing to get evaluation up, and it was sort of delivering on a medium-term target. Our focus is very much on organic execution towards the targets and consistently delivering to the promise. Outside of sort of big bank M&A, we are always open to sort of bolt-on M&A. We do that very well too. We see that more in the realm of payments or institutional world, and that’s opportunistic. We’re always looking at any properties that might augment either scale or the product capability. The focus right now is organic growth.

Jason, Analyst: Good to hear. One question we get asked a lot is just how you’re preparing for the category two regulatory designation. You expect to cross that. Any update there?

John Stern, Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Bancorp: Yeah, certainly, we continue to grow. We have no restrictions on growth. Along with what our forecast indicates, we think no earlier than 2027 is when we cross that $700 billion mark to get into category two. There’s been a fair amount of investment that we’ve made in terms of reporting, in terms of infrastructure, and all those sorts of things. Some of the technology questions that I answered earlier in this have gone into the development of that as we get ready for higher regulatory expectations, what our expectation is at this point. We have that all embedded in the run rate. Again, no earlier than 2027 is when we expect to get there.

Jason, Analyst: Got it. Just to put up the last ARS question. Gunjan, maybe to wrap up, we’ve talked in the past about kind of restoring investors’ confidence in U.S. Bancorp’s narrative and execution is your top priority. In your view, kind of what aspects of U.S. Bancorp’s story do you believe the market may be overlooking or underestimating? What do you think it will take to get the stock back to its premium valuation?

Gunjan Kedia, CEO, U.S. Bancorp: I am very committed to restoring investor confidence. I hear the concerns. I accept them. We are quite focused on that. In the immediate term, we need to just deliver consistent financial results marching towards our medium-term targets. That is credibility building on execution. Once that confidence comes back to the investor base, the true strength of the franchise will come through. It’s a high return, low efficiency ratio, very risk-managed franchise. When you combine that with a diversified fee-oriented mix, the impeccable culture, the memorable brand, and just a long track record of consistent performance, I think the investor story will be very, very strong.

Jason, Analyst: Great. On that note, please join me in thanking Gunjan and John for their time today.

ID37,S&P Global,2025-09-09 16:05:39+00:00,CIO,9 cloud strategy questions every IT leader must answer - CIO,"Stephanie Overby, e& Enterprise, Bob Violino, John Edwards, Stephanie Overby Contributing",,,,,https://www.cio.com/article/4051063/9-cloud-strategy-questions-every-it-leader-must-answer.html,"“We move workloads to the cloud only to discover they are not a fit for the cloud, they are too expensive, regulations change, workload demands change.” As a result, frequent reassessments of cloud strategy are essential.
“While cloud adoption comes with many advantages — scalability, resiliency, and reliability —achieving a strong ROI remains a challenge if the cloud strategy is not comprehensive,” says Krishna Mohan, vice president and global head of the cloud business unit at consultancy TCS.
“It was the perfect trigger to revisit their entire cloud strategy,” Topinka says.
Does our cloud strategy align with our sustainability goals?
As Topinka urges: “Your cloud strategy needs to be a living plan, reviewed often, or it will age out quickly.”","The early days of cloud computing were about migrating infrastructure paradigms for cost savings. In recent years, however, cloud has become a critical enabler of rapid development and digital innovation.

“The ability to spin up environments on demand, leverage robust service libraries, and access global scalability fundamentally transformed how organizations deliver products and services,” says Joe Nathan, associate principal with The Hackett Group.

Meanwhile, the broader technology landscape has also changed dramatically. “The rise of AI, increasing cyber threats, evolving data requirements, regulatory scrutiny, and the rapid advancement of cloud-native architectures have introduced new levels of complexity — and opportunity,” Nathan says. The wrong moves can set organizations back, while the right ones can enable them to leapfrog rivals.

But CIOs’ increasing experience with the cloud has also led them to rethink where specific workloads perform best.

“Cloud repatriation is a reality,” says Niel Nickolaisen, longtime IT leader and current director of strategic engagements for JourneyTeam. “We move workloads to the cloud only to discover they are not a fit for the cloud, they are too expensive, regulations change, workload demands change.”

As a result, frequent reassessments of cloud strategy are essential. “The pace of change in these areas makes ‘set and forget’ cloud strategies obsolete,” says Joe Topinka, veteran IT leader and founder of CIO Mentor. “This becomes even more urgent during major platform shifts or when emerging technology ambitions outpace current infrastructure.”

Cloud strategies must be continuously realigned with business priorities and new technologies. “The decisions made today will shape long-term agility, compliance posture, cost efficiency, and innovation potential,” Hackett Group’s Nathan says.

S&P Global, for example, which operates in more than 35 countries, has had to integrate compliance with diverse and evolving regulatory requirements into its cloud architecture.

“Without robust cloud governance, organizations risk cost overruns, security vulnerabilities, and missed innovation opportunities,” says Swamy Kocherlakota, chief digital solutions officer at S&P Global.

Following are questions IT leaders should ask about their cloud strategies to ensure they continue to serve their business ambitions.

Do we have an enterprise framework to guide cloud decisions?

Cloud platforms are increasingly procured by non-IT teams. Establishing a unified decision framework that brings together expertise from across the enterprise to guide the cloud lifecycle, from selection to sunsetting, is key.

Without this, “organizations face fragmented architectures, redundant tools, and compliance gaps,” says CIO Mentor’s Topinka, who saw the marketing team at one client select a cloud-based customer engagement platform, only for the legal team to discover later that it introduced serious privacy issues. The company then brought together experts from legal, cyber, privacy, risk, and finance to develop a framework that ensures every cloud decision is evaluated for security, compliance, and scalability, without slowing down business-led innovation.

How can we capitalize on multicloud without sacrificing standardization?

Working with multiple cloud partners can offer negotiating leverage and access to best-of-breed services, but it also compounds complexity and requires a range of expertise.

“To address this, develop clear decision frameworks for selecting cloud providers based on workload requirements, security considerations, and cost models,” S&P Global’s Kocherlakota says.

IT leaders can also establish centers of excellence for each major cloud platform and establish a cross-cloud architecture team to ensure consistency and integration across platforms, he adds.

Do we have the talent and culture to innovate in the cloud?

“Technology alone does not create innovation; people do,” says Topinka. “I have seen teams hesitate to adopt new approaches because they are comfortable with what they know.”

At one client organization, Topinka helped create a small, cross-functional innovation team. These individuals, tapped for their curiosity and fearlessness, were paired with mentors and given permission to experiment, ultimately delivering a new customer-facing capability that expanded the organization’s market reach in ways leadership had not considered.

“The maturity and advancement of cloud solutions depend on the team’s culture and their ability to operate and innovate within the cloud,” Hackett Group’s Nathan adds.

Are we prepared to manage cloud costs at scale?

Developing a three- to five-year cost model is essential to understand the break-even period, steady-state benefits, and total cost of ownership of a cloud solution, Nathan says.

In addition, “many organizations face ‘sticker shock’ due to inefficiencies in resource provisioning and suboptimal architectures,” says S&P Global’s Kocherlakota, who advises implementing robust tagging strategies, adopting automated monitoring tools, and conducting regular optimization reviews.

“Clear visibility into consumption patterns, resource allocation, and usage metrics is essential,” says Nathan, noting that cloud financial management practices help maintain accountability and prevent cost overruns, particularly in multicloud environments.

Allocating cloud costs directly to business units or product teams also increases transparency and encourages more efficient use of cloud resources, according to Kocherlakota.

Is our cloud strategy truly advancing operations and the business?

“While cloud adoption comes with many advantages — scalability, resiliency, and reliability —achieving a strong ROI remains a challenge if the cloud strategy is not comprehensive,” says Krishna Mohan, vice president and global head of the cloud business unit at consultancy TCS.

“Cloud is far more than a technical architecture upgrade,” he adds. “Often in enterprises, the legacy systems hold important core business logic, so legacy modernization on cloud to drive business benefits is key. But it’s more nuanced and complex and time consuming.”

Cloud adoption without attendant legacy modernization can backfire, S&P Global’s Kocherlakota says. “Simply using the cloud as a data center while maintaining legacy applications can lead to cost creep,” he says. “Investing in transforming legacy systems optimizes infrastructure and boosts efficiency.”

The good news, says Mohan, is that generative AI is slashing the time it takes to modernize legacy systems from four to five years to 18 to 24 months, “but it requires accelerated governance, reskilling, and risk management.”

A large organization Topinka worked with was replacing a decades-old mainframe system with a cloud ERP platform. “It was the perfect trigger to revisit their entire cloud strategy,” Topinka says. “Without that reset, they would have simply replicated outdated processes in a new environment, missing opportunities to modernize governance, integration, and innovation approaches.”

How will AI impact our cloud architecture and governance needs?

“AI fundamentally changes compute requirements, storage demands, cost models, and security needs,” says Topinka. “Ignore this, and you will have an expensive, insecure science project.”

One organization he worked with planned to run all AI workloads in a single public cloud region until they realized that data residency regulations would make that option non-compliant. A hybrid approach addressed regulatory requirements and kept the project on track.

“Even with the best intentions, AI programs will stall or misfire if they are not grounded in a cloud architecture built for scale, compliance, and secure operations,” Topinka says.

Another of Topinka’s clients had minimal cloud experience and quickly committed to an aggressive AI program. “Their data pipelines, security model, and governance structures were not ready for AI-scale workloads,” Topinka explains. “Revisiting the cloud strategy before scaling AI saved them from costly rework and allowed the AI program to deliver business value faster.”

Access to the high-quality data required for AI models — particularly large language models — is a must.

“Data pipelines are a foundational requirement because they are the fuel that drives the AI models and enables continuous learning and feedback loops to improve model outputs,” says Dinakar Hituvalli, CTO at enterprise software and project management firm Deltek.

To help a large logistics company develop a cloud strategy aligned with its AI and data transformation objectives, Hackett Group’s Nathan says they began with a reassessment of cloud goals before turning to AI readiness, ensuring the infrastructure could support data centralization, model training, and scalable inference, while addressing regional data residency requirements to support the company’s expansion into Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Does our cloud strategy align with our sustainability goals?

“As enterprises increasingly prioritize environmental responsibility, it’s important to request and compare detailed environmental impact data from cloud providers,” says Kocherlakota, especially as cloud providers vary in their commitments to renewable energy and carbon neutrality.

IT leaders can factor energy efficiency into their cloud decisions by hosting workloads in regions powered by renewable energy and optimizing workloads to minimize consumption. “This not only supports sustainability goals but can also enhance brand reputation and align with corporate social responsibility initiatives,” Kocherlakota says.

Should our cloud-first strategy be cloud-only?

In short, no, says Mohan of TCS. Today’s organizations may find that hybrid or distributed cloud designs may make sense in situations with complex business, security, regulatory, or operational spending requirements. It’s about the right workload placement.

AI is also having an impact on these decisions. “Traditionally, enterprises pulled data to a centralized location for orchestration, production, and deriving value,” says Mohan. “With AI now being applied to wherever the data resides across the IT estate, organizations can drive more impactful edge use cases and outcomes.”

As such, CIO’s cloud strategies should consider hybrid and edge solutions. “With AI and cloud working together, CIOs can balance out their return on investment, since edge cloud reduces latency, improves reliability, lowers data transfer, and enables real-time decision-making, directly improving customer experience and ROI,” Mohan says.

What happens if we need to move to a different service or provider?

“In a time of rapid change and massive uncertainty it is critical for technology leaders to avoid technology dead ends. Sadly, it is hard to predict the form of those dead ends,” says Nickolaisen. “Anything in our world may be a barrier to agility — that includes cloud architecture and decisions.”

Whereas in the past a cloud decision may have been primarily made based on cost and elasticity, leaders must now consider obsolescence and portability of workloads, contracts, and skills. IT leaders should work through what they can do to reduce “switching costs” because they might need to change technologies, providers, tools, and skills quickly.

“How can we loosely couple cloud services from other services so that we can find a reasonable balance between replaceability and reusability? Even things like contract terms might need to change to roll with the uncertainty punches,” says Nickolaisen, who has been able to migrate from one cloud provider to another, and migrate to or repatriate from the cloud, in hours. “This becomes essential when conditions are changing quickly, as they are now,” Nickolaisen says.

As Topinka urges: “Your cloud strategy needs to be a living plan, reviewed often, or it will age out quickly.”",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4051063-0-22053400-1757412282-cloud-strategy-questions-shutterstock_2675764721.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-09 18:17:08.578565

For Matthew Dolan (pictured), president of North America specialty and executive vice president of global risk solutions at Liberty Mutual Insurance, the market has evolved beyond cyclical forces and is now anchored in structural necessity.
“Yes, there are always cyclical catalysts that push business from admitted to E&S,” he said.
In his assessment, cyclical forces still matter, but the market today is “much more predominantly structural than cyclical.” Complex risk and wholesaler distribution fuel E&S growth Dolan pointed to the heightened complexity and fluidity of today’s risk environment as the primary driver of E&S growth.
“The combination of hotter, wetter, faster, stronger storms with challenged infrastructure creates a very dynamic risk equation,” Dolan told Insurance Business.","The US domestic E&S market maintained strong momentum in 2024, although its pace of expansion has slowed for the second consecutive year, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Premiums have now recorded double-digit annual growth for six consecutive years. However, after years of rapid acceleration, this growth raises the critical question: Is the surge in E&S a cyclical reaction or a permanent shift?

For Matthew Dolan (pictured), president of North America specialty and executive vice president of global risk solutions at Liberty Mutual Insurance, the market has evolved beyond cyclical forces and is now anchored in structural necessity.

Dolan’s view is that while both forces are at play, the balance has tilted. “Yes, there are always cyclical catalysts that push business from admitted to E&S,” he said. “But now we’re seeing more permanence.

He argued that there’s a growing recognition that E&S is an appropriate mechanism for today’s risk environment: one that’s faster, more complex, and unlikely to revert to something predictable or benign. In his assessment, cyclical forces still matter, but the market today is “much more predominantly structural than cyclical.”

Complex risk and wholesaler distribution fuel E&S growth

Dolan pointed to the heightened complexity and fluidity of today’s risk environment as the primary driver of E&S growth. Climate change, weakened infrastructure, and increasingly severe natural catastrophes have reshaped the property market.

“The combination of hotter, wetter, faster, stronger storms with challenged infrastructure creates a very dynamic risk equation,” Dolan told Insurance Business. “The ability to respond quickly is incredibly important, and the E&S market is designed to facilitate exactly that.”

“When admitted mechanisms can’t respond quickly enough, business migrates to E&S where flexibility in terms, limits, and pricing is possible,” said Dolan.

Specialty lines, including environmental, healthcare, financial, and cyber, are also contributing to the expansion. Cyber in particular exemplifies the need for adaptability as exposures evolve rapidly.

Another factor is the rise of wholesale distribution. Wholesalers have grown in scale and sophistication, becoming central to connecting risks with solutions. Their influence, Dolan said, has reinforced the self-perpetuating growth of the E&S market: as more business flows in, more carriers and managing general agents (MGAs) invest in aligned capabilities, attracting even more activity.

However, not all lines are growing equally: property remains the most visibly cyclical segment. While E&S property has proven its structural relevance, pricing is heavily influenced by competitive swings. Wind-exposed catastrophe pricing, for example, has fallen sharply.

“Some would argue that it’s disproportionately low and may not be sustainable if we see a major cat event,” Dolan said.

Cyber shows similar traits. Though it has matured, Dolan argues that pricing is now lagging the true level of risk. “There’s significant latent risk, and it may take an event—or a series of losses—for pricing to recalibrate,” he said.

Property, though cyclical, will likely shift more business into E&S following catastrophe events. Casualty, meanwhile, continues to pose challenges across admitted and E&S markets alike, leaving room for sustained growth.

The strengths of the E&S model – speed and flexibility – are also not guaranteed in the long term. Dolan sees two potential inhibitors. First, regulatory oversight. “As more business moves into E&S, there’s always the possibility of increased regulation,” he said. “We haven’t seen meaningful examples yet, but it’s something we monitor because it could slow down E&S’s ability to respond quickly.”

Second, oversupply of capital. Growth has attracted investment and new entrants, and excessive capacity could drive pricing below sustainable levels. “That could distort the market and cause performance issues,” Dolan said.

How can wholesale brokers succeed in this environment?

Despite risks, Dolan sees positive trends in collaboration between carriers and wholesalers. Both sides now share a clearer strategic alignment: delivering responsive, bespoke solutions for clients. Data and analytics are strengthening that partnership by helping wholesalers and carriers better assess loss performance, align appetites, and improve efficiency.

Data is also central to maintaining market discipline. “Historical data is useful, but in a rapidly evolving environment, it’s not always predictive,” Dolan said. “The real differentiator is using contemporary, real-time data to anticipate changes and adjust coverage or pricing accordingly.”

“It’s relatively easy to get in, but significantly more difficult to stay in and do it really well,” he said. “Effective use of data and analytics will be critical to avoiding oversupply-driven disruptions.”

For Dolan, the E&S market’s role is set to expand further. “Commitment to the E&S space is about creating real-time, sustainable risk transfer solutions,” he said.

“That’s the challenge and the beauty of E&S: it requires a contemporary understanding of how risks are evolving. We see it as a vital part of the insurance ecosystem, and we’re deeply committed to it.”",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/003/0356_638930188156702975.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:18:04.434476

“Twenty-five years ago, we partnered with Microsoft to launch one of the fashion industry’s first eCommerce platforms, and today, we are once again redefining the shopping experience for the next generation,” Ralph Lauren Corp. Chief Branding and Innovation Officer David Lauren said in the release.

Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president of global industry solutions at Microsoft, said in the release: “AI is transforming the way consumers get inspired, educated and purchase from fashion brands around the world.”

PYMNTS reported in February 2024 that AI is revolutionizing the fashion industry by enabling innovations across design, production and shopping.

A 2023 study by McKinsey & Company predicted that the technology could add up to an additional $275 billion in fashion profits over the following three to five years.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Getting to Know You: How AI Is Shaping the Future of Shopping,” published in September 2024, found that 32% of all consumers said they had used or would use AI shopping tools.

When luxury accessories membership club Vivrelle announced its launch of an “AI stylist” Thursday (Sept. 4), the company said the tool enables consumers to, “Borrow, style and shop in one seamless 360 experience and checkout.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ralph-Lauren-AskRalph-AI.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:46:18.392912

US FOOD giant Kraft Heinz will divide into two standalone companies by mid-2026, aiming to reverse a prolonged slump in share price and unlock greater brand value.

The larger of the two new companies, yet to be named, will focus on sauces, spreads and seasonings which currently contribute US$15.4bn to Kraft Heinz’s net sales. It will include all Heinz- and Philadelphia-branded products, along with Kraft Mac & Cheese, and the Indonesian and Chinese condiments brands ABC and Master.

The second company will focus on North American grocery products such as packaged meats and cheeses and ready meals, including Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables, which currently contribute US$10.4bn to Kraft Heinz’s net sales. Full brand allocation between the two companies is yet to be announced.

The move echoes Kellogg’s 2023 decision to split into separate snack and cereal businesses.

Kraft Heinz did not specify the reasons behind its poor performance, although CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera hinted at mounting competition from lower-cost own-brand products, saying in an interview that he is “conscious of how consumers today, in the US in particular, are under pressure”. Abrams-Rivera will take the helm of the newly formed groceries-focused business, while the Kraft Heinz board is in the process of appointing a CEO to lead the sauces and spreads company.

The food giant has performed poorly on financial markets since Heinz bought Kraft in 2015. At the time of last week’s announcement, the Heinz Kraft share price was 26% lower than it was 12 months earlier, and 70% lower than in 2017. The board’s unanimous decision to split the company came after a strategic review was launched in May. Jack Pope, the lead director of the Kraft Heinz board, said he is confident the move “will translate into better performance and value creation for shareholders”.

Beanz there, done that

The 2015 merger between Kraft and Heinz was bankrolled by US conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity fund 3G Capital, who spent a combined US$28bn taking Heinz private in 2013, followed by US$63bn to buy Kraft two years later. Billionaire chair of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett admitted to overpaying for Kraft in 2019, and today Kraft Heinz’s market value is just US$31bn. The board believes the total value of the two new companies could be greater than this, although Buffett told CNBC last week he was “disappointed” when the news of the split broke.

Concerns began to surface in 2023 when 3G Capital sold its entire stake in Kraft Heinz without formally notifying the company’s directors. Tensions became more visible in May this year, when two Berkshire Hathaway executives resigned from the board.

Berkshire Hathaway remains the largest shareholder in Kraft Heinz with a 27.5% stake, although the capital structure of the two new companies is yet to be announced. Kraft Heinz has said the separation transaction will be tax-free but will incur up to US$300m in additional costs.

Miguel Patricio, executive chair of the board of Kraft Heinz, said: “Kraft Heinz’s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritise initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/21950/heinzbeans.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-09-09 13:25:57.730985

The new capabilities unify policy management with Vanta AI Agent, offer continuous monitoring for vendors and provide risk oversight and deeper integrations that give security leaders a single system to record to act on risk before it escalations.

The new capabilities seek to address the issue whereby risk management solutions are often fragmented across different siloed tools, teams and manual processes. Vanta argues that the disjointed approach keeps teams reactive, with critical risks often going unnoticed until it’s too late, slowing audits, delaying deals and leaving organizations exposed.

Vanta’s new capabilities have been designed to deal with fragmentation by embedding agentic AI into policy and evidence workflow and in doing so, centralizing risk registers into enterprise rollups. The idea is that with one system of record, organizations can smoothly operate and leaders gain visibility and proactive control. The result delivers reduced manual reporting, accelerates audits and strengthens trust.

“Organizations have long struggled with fragmented systems and reactive reviews,” said Chief Product Officer Jeremy Epling. “By embedding AI in policy workflows and unifying risk oversight across registers and vendors, we are changing how security teams operate.”

The Vanta AI Agent is now embedded in organizational context to manage policy workflows and is able to generate audit-ready policies, execute bulk updates across entire libraries and validate documentation for completeness. With the new capabilities, Vanta automates the most time-consuming tasks and keeps organizations continuously audit-ready by extending the same proactive intelligence that already flags gaps in evidence and service level agreement inconsistencies.

The new capabilities also offer a centralized, proactive approach to risk management, aligning business functions up to and through the boardroom.

New features include Multiple Risk Registers that allow organizations to structure risk management around their business units, with tailored views and risks for each function or category. A complementary feature called Enterprise Risk Rollups then consolidates those registers into a unified, real-time dashboard for executive-level visibility.

For vendor risk management, Vanta is offering continuous oversight, real-time vendor monitoring and triggering alerts based on configurable thresholds. Through continuous monitoring and alerts, summaries streamline questionnaires and surface key findings, ensuring vendor risks are identified proactively and that organizations can take immediate action.

Lastly, Vanta has also enhanced its Slack integration for security workflows with the ability to embed security workflows directly into the tools employees already use. Teams can submit and approve access requests, respond to reviews and questionnaires and receive timely notifications all without leaving Slack.

Vanta was previously in the news in July when it announced it had raised $150 million in new funding to accelerate AI innovation and expansion into new markets, including third-party risk and government compliance. The Series D round was led by Wellington Management Co. LLP and included Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Sequoia Capital Operations, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Craft Ventures Management, Y Combinator, Atlassian Ventures and CrowdStrike Ventures.

August 27, 2025

To Our Shareholders,

We are living through one of the most profound moments in healthcare history - where artificial intelligence, robotics, sensing, and predictive modeling unlock the most complex operating system in the world: the human body. Patient and provider needs are shifting rapidly, and technology's capacity to meet those needs has never been greater. At the same time, we are entering one of the most pivotal moments in Medtronic's 76-year history. We are at the forefront of this transformation - pioneering innovations that will redefine care, not just improve it. And this is only the beginning.

A dynamic healthcare landscape

Healthcare systems everywhere are under pressure, with rising costs, challenging reimbursement, and persistent staffing shortages. At the same time, care is being redefined as procedures shift from hospitals to outpatient clinics and ambulatory surgical centers. And all the while, rapid advances in AI and digital technology are increasing the pace of change and the nature of competition in all industries, including healthcare.

For Medtronic, these realities have been a call to action. They reinforced that innovation must extend beyond devices alone - to how we partner with customers, integrate into new care settings, and support clinicians before, during and after procedures. We are advancing these new types of innovation, while continuing to deliver the world class product innovation and clinical outcomes that have defined Medtronic for decades.

A changing Medtronic

It is against this backdrop of change that we have been transforming Medtronic to unlock its full potential. Since 2020, we've taken on a methodical evolution that continues today. We redesigned our Operating Model to streamline decision-making and bring us closer to customers and patients. We have built agility and resilience into our supply chain and strengthened reliability and quality, raising standards across the enterprise - both in terms of our people, and the level at which we must execute.

Focused innovation driving growth

To meet the evolving needs of our customers and patients - and to position Medtronic for long-term success - we are shifting the nature of our innovation in meaningful ways. We are increasing investment in

R&D, sharpening our focus through the divestiture of Diabetes, and advancing therapies that not only improve outcomes but also make care simpler, more seamless, and more sustainable. Just as important, we are leveraging our world-class expertise in product development with industry-leading know-how in AI and digital technologies.

One of our core strengths has always been scaling global innovation: taking breakthrough ideas and bringing them to patients and clinicians worldwide. Today, our pipeline is the broadest and deepest in our history, with several once-in-a-generation technologies coming to fruition. But as physicians and hospital leaders remind us, even the most advanced therapy is of little value if it disrupts strained workflows. Technologies must deliver superior clinical outcomes while fitting seamlessly into practice, so clinicians can focus on their patients. That perspective guides our design and deployment of innovative solutions across the enterprise - both those advancing care today and those on the near horizon, such as:

AiBLE™ digital ecosystem gives physicians tools that make procedures more precise and

workflows more efficient - raising the bar for the industry and prompting competitors to exit.

Pulsed-field ablation (PFA) is establishing the new standard of care in atrial fibrillation, and our newest suite of technologies, including the Affera™ mapping and navigation system with Sphere-9™ catheter, is transforming the field.

Closed-loop sensing in neuromodulation enables real-time therapy adjustments for both pain and brain disorders, personalizing care and reducing clinic visits.

Tibial implantable neurostimulator will provide a more convenient, effective option to millions suffering from bladder incontinence.

Robotic-assisted surgery platform expands access to quality surgery across indications and geographies through advanced instrumentation and seamless integration.

Symplicity™ renal denervation therapy may be the biggest thing Medtronic ever does, offering a single procedure to help redefine care for many struggling with hypertension, one of the world's most prevalent conditions.

These and other developments in our pipeline are not incremental advances. They are market-shaping innovations that reflect deliberate portfolio choices - focusing resources where our technology, scale, and Mission come together. By aligning innovation with customer needs and global demand, we are not only redefining care but also creating durable drivers of revenue growth, margin expansion, and longterm shareholder value.

Our FY25 performance

That progress is showing up in our performance. In FY25, revenue grew 4.9% on an organic basis to $33.6 billion in FY25, driven by portfolio strength and our innovation pipeline. We delivered non-GAAP operating profit of $8.65 billion, up 5% (9% constant currency), with operating margins expanding to 25.7%, a 100-basis-point increase on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.49 rose 6%, or 10% on a constant currency basis. GAAP results also improved meaningfully, with operating profit up 16% and EPS up 31%. We returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, marking our 48th consecutive year of dividend increases.

Guided by Our Mission

Performance matters. And what makes Medtronic unique is that our actions are always rooted in our

Mission, which has been our North Star since it was written more than 60 years ago. It drives us to harness the power of science and technology to address the most pressing needs in healthcare, and it keeps us grounded in the truth that behind every therapy and every data point is a person who needs our help. In FY25 alone, our technologies reached more than 79 million people: an extraordinary milestone, yet only a fraction of those who could benefit.

Looking ahead, we are confident in our trajectory. The combination of our Mission, our people, and our innovation engine positions us to lead with purpose. We are delivering therapies that create new markets and disrupt existing ones. At the same time, we are fueling accelerated growth by actively managing our portfolio - including targeted tuck-in M&A. We are building a stronger, more focused Medtronic: clear about where we play, bold in how we innovate, and unwavering in our commitment to patients. That is how we will create lasting value for all stakeholders - and, most importantly, continue to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life for people around the world.

ID19,H&M,2025-09-09 15:35:46+00:00,Grist,Report: Big businesses are doing carbon dioxide removal all wrong - Grist.org,Joseph Winters,,,,,https://grist.org/accountability/report-carbon-dioxide-removal-companies/,"But only some types of carbon removal are actually effective — and these are largely not the kind that major companies are investing in.
The handful of companies investing in more reliable carbon removal are mostly not doing so in conjunction with deep decarbonization, or the elimination of carbon emissions altogether.
Currently, these durable techniques don’t work at scale: They account for just 0.1 percent of global carbon removal each year.
Government investment and regulations are needed to scale up durable CDR — experts consider the next decade to be “crucial” for developing the technology — but the private sector can help too, by funding durable CDR projects and research.
Tech companies can fully decarbonize without offsets, so their emissions targets should not depend on carbon removal.","Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 will require removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s foremost authority on the topic. But only some types of carbon removal are actually effective — and these are largely not the kind that major companies are investing in.

A new report from the NewClimate Institute, a European think tank, finds that 35 of the world’s biggest businesses are leaning on short-term tree-planting and other forms of “nondurable” carbon removal in order to say they’ve neutralized some of their climate pollution. The handful of companies investing in more reliable carbon removal are mostly not doing so in conjunction with deep decarbonization, or the elimination of carbon emissions altogether.

There is a “dangerous mismatch between corporate climate claims and the reality of what is needed to reach global net-zero,” the organization said in a press release. Reaching net-zero by the middle of the century — a scenario where all unavoidable human-caused climate pollution is canceled out via carbon removal — is considered necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Carbon dioxide removal, or CDR, refers to efforts to capture CO2 after it’s been emitted into the atmosphere and store it in rocks, land, ocean reservoirs, or human-made products. The most reliable types of carbon removal, which the NewClimate Institute calls “durable CDR,” involve injecting carbon into geological formations or turning it into rocks, where it will stay put for at least 1,000 years — about the same amount of time that CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels will remain in the atmosphere.

Currently, these durable techniques don’t work at scale: They account for just 0.1 percent of global carbon removal each year. The rest is based on methods like planting trees, restoring wetlands, and burying carbon in the soil, which are much cheaper but can only keep carbon out of the atmosphere for decades or a few centuries at most.

Government investment and regulations are needed to scale up durable CDR — experts consider the next decade to be “crucial” for developing the technology — but the private sector can help too, by funding durable CDR projects and research. In industries like construction, for which total decarbonization is not yet possible, companies will likely need to use durable CDR to offset residual emissions as part of a credible climate strategy.

The NewClimate Institute authors looked at 35 of the world’s largest companies across seven sectors: agrifood, aviation, automobiles, fashion, fossil fuels, tech, and utilities. Tech companies showed the most investment in durable CDR — Microsoft alone is responsible for 70 percent of all durable CDR ever contracted — but the report criticizes the sector for planning to claim “potentially significant amounts” of both durable and nondurable CDR toward net-zero targets. Tech companies can fully decarbonize without offsets, so their emissions targets should not depend on carbon removal.

Aviation was the other sector showing the greatest support for durable CDR, but only one airline — Japan’s All Nippon Airways — had a “reasonable” plan to use the technology to neutralize residual emissions by 2050. Three airlines lacked concrete plans.

Of the 15 companies across the agrifood, automobiles, and fashion sectors, only H&M and Stellantis are investing in durable CDR. Two of the five utilities in the report, Eon and Orsted, are supporting durable CDR projects, but it’s unclear whether Eon intends to use removals to count toward its net-zero goal, and the NewClimate Institute says some of Orsted’s removals are being double-counted in the emissions reduction targets of both Denmark and Microsoft. The five fossil fuel companies analyzed — Equinor, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Sinopec, and TotalEnergies — are focusing mostly on carbon capture and storage, which intercepts CO2 at the point of emission, before it escapes into the atmosphere, and does not reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

Silke Mooldijk, an expert with the NewClimate Institute and the lead author of the new report, said she wasn’t surprised to find limited support for durable CDR, except from some tech companies. What did surprise her was that companies investing in durable CDR projects did not publicly report any information on these projects’ environmental and social risks. Some CDR methods, for example, may jeopardize biodiversity, while others require large amounts of renewable energy that would have to be diverted from other uses. “Not a single company in our report disclosed details on potential risks of projects they support and how they mitigate those,” Mooldijk told Grist.

Grist reached out to all 35 companies included in the report. Adidas, Amazon, Enel, Google, H&M, Inditex, Microsoft, and TotalEnergies responded by describing their net-zero commitments. Adidas and Enel, which are not currently investing in durable CDR, said they would use “high-quality” carbon removals to offset their residual climate pollution after taking actions to decarbonize; Inditex said it is “exploring” durable CDR to offset residual emissions, and its use of the technology “will be determined by the evolution of reference scientific frameworks.”

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and H&M are currently investing in durable CDR. A spokesperson for H&M described the fast-fashion company’s purchase of 10,000 metric tons of durable CDR from the Swiss company Climeworks, one of the largest purchases to date, and said H&M plans to use them to neutralize residual emissions. The tech companies affirmed their commitment to reduce emissions first and then use carbon removal to offset residual emissions, though none of them addressed NewClimate Institute’s concerns that they would use large amounts of durable and nondurable CDR to claim progress toward net-zero.

A statement provided to Grist from TotalEnergies did not address CDR. It instead described the company’s support for carbon capture and storage and “nature-based solutions.” The latter refers to short-lived offsets, such as tree-planting, that the NewClimate Institute does not believe are appropriate for offsetting fossil fuel emissions.

Apple, Duke Energy, Google, and Shein declined to comment after seeing the report. The remaining 24 companies did not respond to inquiries from Grist.

Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan and the dean of its School for Environment and Sustainability, said the NewClimate Institute report is timely. “Right now the whole idea of CDR … is kind of a Wild West scene, with lots of actors promising to do things that may or may not be possible,” he said. He added that companies appear to be using CDR as an alternative to mitigating their climate pollution.

“The priority has to be on reducing emissions, not on durable CDR at this point,” he told Grist.

In the near term, durable CDR is doing virtually nothing to offset emissions. As of 2023, only 0.0023 gigatons of CO2 were removed from the atmosphere each year using these methods. That’s about 15,000 times less than the annual amount of climate pollution from fossil fuels and cement manufacturing.

According to the NewClimate Institute, voluntary initiatives are no substitute for government-mandated emissions reduction targets and investments in durable CDR. To the extent that these initiatives exist, however, the organization says they should provide a clearer definition of what constitutes “durable” carbon removal; determine companies’ responsibility for scaling up durable CDR based on their ongoing and historical emissions, or — perhaps more realistically — on their ability to pay; and require companies to set separate targets for emissions reductions and support for durable CDR. The last recommendation is intended to reinforce a climate action hierarchy that puts mitigation before offsetting. Companies should not “hide inaction on decarbonization behind investments in removals,” as the report puts it.

Mooldijk said voluntary initiatives can incentivize investments in durable CDR by recognizing “climate contributions.” These might manifest as simple statements about companies’ monetary contributions to durable CDR, instead of claims about the amount of CO2 that they have theoretically neutralized.

Some of these recommendations were submitted earlier this year to the Science-Based Targets initiative, the world’s most respected verifier of private sector climate targets. The organization is getting ready to update its corporate net-zero standard with new guidance on the use of CDR. Another standard-setter, the International Organization for Standardization, is similarly preparing to release new standards on net-zero, which could curtail some of the most questionable corporate climate claims while also drumming up support for durable CDR.

John Reilly, a senior lecturer emeritus at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said that ultimately, proper regulation of corporate climate commitments — including of durable CDR — will fall on governments. Companies “are happy to throw a little money into these things,” he said, “but I don’t think voluntary guidelines are ever going to get you there.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/smokestacks.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-09 12:44:36.342696

Spats between providers and drugmakers in 340B are nothing new, but are heating up as the program — and the money it represents — expands.
As for drugmakers’ unilateral rebate plans, a federal judge paused their implementation in May — though the ruling left the door open for such models in the future.","Dive Brief:

The country’s largest hospital lobby is accusing five major drugmakers of secretly conspiring to transition to a rebate model in 340B, in the latest salvo between providers and pharmaceutical companies over the future of the drug discount program.

On Monday, the American Hospital Association sent a letter to the heads of the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s antitrust division asking them to investigate Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis for potential collusion.

The AHA’s letter points to the overlapping timeline of the drugmakers’ building up to and then announcing their 340B rebate plans, all of which occurred over the same five months.

Dive Insight:

Johnson & Johnson got the ball rolling last summer when it met with federal regulators to test the waters for a proposal to pay hospitals after-the-fact rebates on drugs in 340B, a program that allows safety-net providers to purchase outpatient drugs from manufacturers at significantly discounted rates. Historically, drugmakers issue the savings in the form of upfront discounts.

But Johnson & Johnson officially announced its new rebate model in August, despite warnings from the Health Resources and Services Administration, the federal agency that oversees 340B, that it was likely illegal.

Then, between August and January, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi and Novartis all unveiled similar rebate proposals, lobbied regulators on their plans and sued the federal government for blocking their way — a timeline that shows a clear pattern of coordination behind the scenes to remake 340B. At least, that’s according to the AHA’s theory of events, which the hospital lobby laid out in the letter to FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the DOJ.

“The announcement of these rebate models came like a bolt from the blue, shocking hospitals and health systems across the nation,” the AHA wrote. “There was no prior concerted lobbying effort on the part of drug companies prior to their announcement. There was no indication whatsoever. The world’s largest drug companies simply stated — within days and weeks of each other — that this was now how it would be done.”

Specifics of the drugmakers’ rebate plans differ, but they all align on one fundamental premise: that they will stop providing upfront discounts for 340B drugs to providers, and instead require providers to buy the drugs at full price and then submit for a rebate later.

The goal is to check that the requested discount is valid before paying it out, to crack down on fraud and abuse in 340B, according to the pharmaceutical companies. But to hospitals, it’s a thinly veiled strategy to avoid paying the discounts that safety-net providers are owed in the decades-old program, which creates billions of dollars in savings.

The AHA’s plea to the Trump administration cites President Donald Trump’s history of commitments to hold drug companies accountable. But healthcare regulators now appear more open to restructuring 340B than their predecessors in the Biden administration. The Trump administration wants to move 340B oversight under the CMS, which has a history of backing rebate models in other programs. The administration also plans to trial a limited rebate program in 340B next year.

Spats between providers and drugmakers in 340B are nothing new, but are heating up as the program — and the money it represents — expands.

Roughly 3,000 hospitals benefit from discounted drugs under the program, which accounted for a record $66.3 billion in purchases in 2023, according to government data. That’s up more than 50% from $43.9 billion just two years prior.

Some critics point to the growth as evidence that 340B has mutated beyond its original intent, with drugmakers accusing hospitals of manipulating the program to profit. It’s a concern shared by some lawmakers, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

This spring, Cassidy published an investigation finding that 340B discounts don’t always translate to lower costs or improved access for patients. The report builds on conflicting evidence as to how providers use 340B funds.

Much of drugmakers’ efforts to constrain 340B have taken place in the courts, with mixed outcomes. For example, last month an appeals court allowed a suit to proceed accusing insulin manufacturers of colluding to restrict providers’ use of contract pharmacies.

As for drugmakers’ unilateral rebate plans, a federal judge paused their implementation in May — though the ruling left the door open for such models in the future.

The report points out this is the second suit by an advertising exchange since a ruling in April that found Google held an illegal monopoly over ad exchanges and the tools employed by websites to sell advertising space.

Another trial is set for later this month to determine Google’s remedies in that case. The U.S. Justice Department has said Google should be made to immediately divest itself of its AdX advertising exchange, while Google says such a measure isn’t necessary. Instead, it has proposed making AdX work seamlessly with rival technology and install a monitor to ensure compliance for the next three years.

PYMNTS has contacted Google for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.

PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel told Bloomberg the April ruling was “meaningful but not complete,” and that his company’s lawsuit wasn’t simply about money, but also about making sure online ad markets work.

“It felt like for many years no matter how well we innovated there was a barrier holding us back,” Goel said. “That barrier wasn’t the limits of our technology. It was Google’s illegal monopoly. Every time we adapted or innovated, Google found new ways to stack the deck.”

Meanwhile, PYMNTS spoke last week with a range of experts about the fallout from the court ruling. Among them was DBD Investment Bank Managing Director Philip Alberstat, who said the court decision could still bring about major changes to the competitive landscape.

completed its $218 million acquisition of 623 Fifth Avenue, a 36-story, 382,500-square-foot office condominium currently 75% vacant [1]. This move, while bold in a market still grappling with post-pandemic uncertainty, underscores a calculated bet on Manhattan’s evolving office landscape. By repositioning the property as a “premier Class A boutique office building,” Vornado is leveraging its prime location above the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store to capitalize on surging demand for high-end, flexible workspaces [4].

The Manhattan Office Market: A Tale of Two Skylines

Manhattan’s office market in 2025 is defined by stark contrasts. On one hand, trophy properties—such as the Time Warner Center or 125 Park Avenue—are commanding rents of $120–$125 per square foot, with occupancy rates nearing pre-pandemic levels [5]. On the other, older Class B and C buildings face vacancy rates exceeding 20%, struggling to compete with modernized alternatives [1]. According to a report by OfficeFinder, the first half of 2025 saw 20.6 million square feet leased, a 17.2% year-over-year increase, driven largely by mid-sized tenants (2,000–7,500 SF) seeking agile, amenity-rich environments [1].

Vornado’s acquisition aligns with this shift. The company’s plan to redevelop 623 Fifth Avenue into a boutique office building—complete with flexible lease terms, wellness-focused amenities, and transit-oriented design—positions it to capture demand from firms prioritizing prestige and productivity [4]. This strategy mirrors broader industry trends, where Class A buildings are offering concessions of up to $30 per square foot to attract tenants, while trophy towers remain resilient [1].

Strategic Rationale: Location, Repositioning, and Long-Term Value

The 623 Fifth Avenue site is a textbook example of “opportunistic repositioning.” Its location in Midtown, adjacent to the 42nd Street subway hub and above a retail anchor, provides inherent demand from both office and consumer markets. Vornado’s decision to redevelop rather than divest reflects confidence in Manhattan’s long-term fundamentals. As stated by Cushman & Wakefield in its Q2 2025 market report, Manhattan’s overall availability rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest in four years, driven by a 44% decline in sublease inventory [4].

Moreover, the acquisition aligns with Vornado’s historical playbook of acquiring distressed assets in prestigious locations. The company’s focus on repositioning aligns with citywide efforts to repurpose underutilized office space. For instance, the 467-m tax exemption program has spurred over 17,400 residential units from office conversions in 2025 alone [2]. While Vornado’s project will remain commercial, its boutique approach mirrors the flexibility seen in mixed-use conversions, such as the 2,000-unit Hell’s Kitchen development by Metro Loft [2].

Challenges and the Path Forward

The 75% vacancy rate at 623 Fifth Avenue is a hurdle, but Vornado’s redevelopment timeline—likely spanning 18–24 months—positions the asset to benefit from Manhattan’s accelerating recovery. Data from Avision Young shows that Midtown’s occupancy rates now average 56% on weekdays, with demand concentrated in buildings offering “exclusive” amenities [3]. By targeting mid-sized tenants and emphasizing premium features, Vornado can command rents exceeding $100 per square foot, offsetting initial redevelopment costs.

A critical risk lies in the pace of market normalization. If remote work trends persist, even trophy properties could face pressure. However, Vornado’s strategy hinges on the premise that Manhattan’s office market will stabilize by 2026, driven by corporate relocations and a return to in-person collaboration.

Conclusion: A Bet on Manhattan’s Resilience

Vornado’s acquisition of 623 Fifth Avenue is more than a real estate transaction—it’s a statement of confidence in Manhattan’s ability to reinvent itself. By transforming a vacant asset into a high-demand office hub, the company is betting on the enduring appeal of prime locations, the growing preference for flexible workspaces, and the city’s broader shift toward mixed-use, transit-oriented development. For investors, this move highlights the importance of strategic repositioning in an era of market flux. As the 2025 data shows, the future of Manhattan’s office market belongs to those who can adapt—and Vornado is positioning itself at the forefront.

Ralph Lauren has launched “Ask Ralph,” a new conversational AI chatbot to provide styling and shopping advice.

Developed with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI platform, the bot can create curated looks from simple prompts and is rolling out on the Ralph Lauren app in the US.

Ralph Lauren is dipping its toe into artificial intelligence (AI) with a new in-app chatbot designed to assist users with styling and shopping advice. The partnership with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI platform is being rolled out on the Ralph Lauren app in the United States, on both Apple and Android devices.

With prompts like “What should I wear to a concert?” or “How can I style my navy-blue men’s blazer?” the Ask Ralph bot can put together a curated look and offer styling tips. The conversational AI feature uses natural language processing to address open-ended prompts, interpret context, and provide recommendations, much like an in-store stylist. Additionally, users can clarify prompts and refine results based on their tastes.

David Lauren, Chief Branding and Innovation Officer and son of Ralph Lauren shared, “Twenty-five years ago, we partnered with Microsoft to launch one of the fashion industry’s first e-commerce platforms, and today, we are once again redefining the shopping experience for the next generation.”

“Ask Ralph is about more than just discovery — it is about engaging consumers with what they love most about Ralph Lauren: our iconic, unique take on style, providing timeless head-to-toe looks that inspire them to step into our world,” he added.

The launch comes as AI continues to penetrate daily life, with chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and X‘s Grok becoming readily available to general users. Now that these generative AI tools have gained mass use, companies like Ralph Lauren are finding ways to tailor these services to their businesses. Elsewhere, fashion trade publication Business of Fashion has launched the Brain of Fashion with Quilt.AI, a bot trained on the platform’s content and business intelligence.

However, it remains to be seen whether customers will welcome branded AI tools in the same way that they have adopted general chatbots. In particular, heritage brands like Lauren’s run the risk of diluting their brand DNA with increased automation. Ralph Lauren and its sibling labels, Polo Ralph Lauren and RRL, draw from the designer’s charismatic personality, his Americana ethos, and focus on authenticity.

Could these sensibilities and traits be translated into an AI-powered chatbot? As AI capabilities advance with more human-like interactions, the prospect doesn’t seem impossible.

The company has plans to continue developing the tool by adding new features, expanding to other brands, and launching in additional global markets.

Nearly eight out of ten online shoppers purchase groceries online, while at least half purchase meat, produce, bakery, dairy, and deli.
“We’re able to uniquely integrate the online and in-store shopping experience through our Connected Stores suite of technologies and e-commerce solutions.
Online, the spokesperson added, a retailer is able to build out a fully customizable online shopping experience for their customers using Storefront Pro while also unlocking new revenue streams through Carrot Ads.
One in four shoppers indicates sustainable / recyclable packaging is very important for their online orders, and nearly half of online shoppers indicated they would be willing to pay an additional fee for two-hour delivery.","The next phase of online ordering of groceries includes recognizing that, yes, most people still like to shop in a brick-and-mortar store — but they also increasingly shop online.

Harmonizing those two realities is increasingly on retailers’ and their online ordering partners’ minds.

According to an Instacart spokesperson, the best way to think about the evolution of the company’s services for retail grocery can be summed up thusly: Instacart is no longer just a grocery delivery platform.

“We’re building the future of omnichannel retail. Today, more than 1,800 retail banners and nearly 100,000 individual stores are available on Instacart across a wide variety of verticals, from grocery and home improvement to beauty, pet supplies, and department stores, and many of them use one or more of our enterprise solutions.”

The company has doubled down on providing enterprise solutions for retailers across its Connected Stores and e-commerce offerings to help them thrive in a world where consumers expect seamless experiences across both digital and physical storefronts, the spokesperson added.

Technology helps retailers find solutions that incorporate both online and in-store shopping. Solutions like Instacart’s AI-powered Caper Carts, Carrot Tags for dynamic digital shelf labeling, and FoodStorm order management system help retailers elevate in-store experiences with the intelligence and convenience of e-commerce.

And through its e-commerce solutions, according to the spokesperson, Instacart empowers retailers to grow their digital storefronts with tools like Storefront Pro, a customizable white-label solution that gives retailers full control over their online brand presence while leveraging Instacart’s proven infrastructure, fulfillment, and customer reach.

With Storefront Pro, retailers can also access Carrot Ads, Instacart’s advertising platform, that allows retailers to create their own retail media networks on their e-comm platforms.

On the upswing

According to a new report from The Feedback Group, Online Food Shopping Experience, 48% of those surveyed said they’re shopping for food online more than they did a year ago.

Seventy-nine percent plan to shop online either the same or more in the next 12 months, and almost seven in ten shoppers use their online provider of choice “a few times or more” every month.

Overall satisfaction with online grocery shopping steadily increases with age, according to The Feedback Group report, and supermarkets receive the highest average overall satisfaction score, notching higher approval rates that club, mass, Amazon and other channels.

Nearly nine out of ten shoppers felt positive about the online user experience after ordering, and seven out of ten shoppers receiving product recommendations or suggestions during their online ordering agree they were relevant to them. Half of those polled 50% reported noticing new items to try while shopping online.

Nearly eight out of ten online shoppers purchase groceries online, while at least half purchase meat, produce, bakery, dairy, and deli. Produce is a leader in fresh categories purchased online, but it also shows the lowest shopper confidence in quality and falls short of highest quality standards more than any other category.

Bringing online and in-store together

In 2025, Instacart is especially excited about how more of its retail partners — in the US and internationally — are embracing and expanding their use of Instacart’s enterprise offerings, according to the spokesperson.

“Retailers are increasingly looking for solutions that bridge online and in-store shopping, and our Connected Stores technologies and e-commerce solutions are enabling just that.”

A few examples of how retailers are using Instacart right now include:

ALDI has deployed several of Instacart’s Connected Stores technologies, including Caper Carts in both the U.S. and Austria, In-Store Mode in the Instacart app, and Carrot Tags software for digital shelf labeling. They also use Storefront Pro and fulfillment capabilities to power its e-commerce experience across the U.S., creating a consistent and intuitive brand experience wherever customers choose to shop.

Schnucks is another retailer using a variety of Instacart’s omnichannel solutions with Caper Carts and Carrot Tags that can be found in store. They also power their e-comm with Storefront Pro and use Carrot Ads on their e-comm site, creating new revenue streams for the retailer

The Save Mart Companies has adopted Caper Carts, FoodStorm and Storefront Pro to power their online and in-store shopping experience for their grocery banners, including Save Mart, Lucky, and FoodMaxx. Storefront Pro allows their grocery banners to create a customizable online storefront powered by Instacart while FoodStorm and Caper Cart customers can now place orders for made-to-order items like fried chicken or custom cakes and pies directly on the Caper Cart screen while they shop, and receive a notification once it’s ready for pickup, providing an effortless, in-store ordering experience.

“Instacart is truly a one-stop shop for in-store and e-comm technology,” according to the spokesperson. “We’re able to uniquely integrate the online and in-store shopping experience through our Connected Stores suite of technologies and e-commerce solutions. Each technology has its own standalone benefits, but when retailers invest in multiple offerings, they provide an omnichannel shopping experience.”

That makes Instacart uniquely positioned to help retailers win in the omnichannel era, delivering a more integrated, personalized, and convenient shopping experience for consumers — whether they’re buying in-store, online, or blending both.

Online, the spokesperson added, a retailer is able to build out a fully customizable online shopping experience for their customers using Storefront Pro while also unlocking new revenue streams through Carrot Ads.

In store, meanwhile, a retailer can streamline and digitize the shopping experience for consumers. A consumer is able to upload their Instacart grocery list to a Caper Cart as they enter the store. As they start shopping, they can place an order for a prepared sandwich from the deli department on their Caper Cart screen powered by FoodStorm.

Then, as they wait for their sandwich to be prepared, they can walk down aisles where Carrot Tags software powers an electronic shelf label to flash so the consumer can quickly identify the product they are looking for.

The future of grocery shopping, according to Instacart, won’t be about choosing between online and in-store — people are going to do both, and it will be important for retailers to have an omnichannel approach.

“Research shows that omnichannel customers are more valuable, with higher purchasing power and more annual shopping trips than brick-and-mortar-only customers. And our omnichannel offerings cater to this hybrid approach. Retailers are able to strengthen both their online and in-store presence and ensure that consumers can shop how they prefer, whether it’s online, in-store, or a combination of both.”

Industry strengths — and areas for improvement

Fair price for convenience of shopping online scores highest in the Feedback Group report, while confidence about personalization scores lowest, with all items showing room for improvement.

On the various touchpoints of the online shopping experience, supermarkets fared well as the top scoring channel on the majority of factors, while the dollar store channel had the most bottom mean scores.

While the majority of shoppers did receive all items ordered, nearly one out of every three did not, and more than nine out of ten shoppers report receiving delivered orders in the time window selected.

Personal shoppers received high marks for being pleasant to deal with and competent. They also received the highest score for improving the online order experience.

Nearly two out of ten shoppers indicated using some AI powered features while shopping online for their most recent online grocery order, and nearly half of shoppers would be at least somewhat likely to add items to an online shopping cart using voice commands if available through their provider.

One in four shoppers indicates sustainable / recyclable packaging is very important for their online orders, and nearly half of online shoppers indicated they would be willing to pay an additional fee for two-hour delivery.

Among those shoppers not already using automated reordering, about half were very or somewhat interested in using automated reordered, the other half were not interested.

By the numbers

From hospitals to manufacturers, stock markets to retail stores, the outage caused parts of the global economy to grind to a halt. Payment systems were disrupted, broadcasters went off the air, and flights were canceled. In all, the outage is estimated to have caused direct losses of more than $5 billion to Fortune 500 companies. For US air carrier Delta Air Lines, the error exposed the brittleness of its systems. The airline suffered weeks of disruptions, leading to $500 million in losses and 7,000 canceled flights.

The magnitude of the CrowdStrike incident revealed just how interconnected digital systems are, and the extensive vulnerabilities in some companies when confronted with an unexpected occurrence. “On any given day, there could be a major weather event or some event like what happened…with CrowdStrike,” said then-US secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg on announcing an investigation into how Delta Air Lines handled the incident. “The question is, is your airline prepared to absorb something like that and get back on its feet and take care of customers?”

Unplanned downtime poses a major challenge for organizations, and is estimated to cost Global 2000 companies on average $200 million per year. Beyond the financial impact, it can also erode customer trust and loyalty, decrease productivity, and even result in legal or privacy issues.

A 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, the medical-billing subsidiary of industry giant UnitedHealth Group—the biggest health and medical data breach in US history—exposed the data of around 190 million people and led to weeks of outages for medical groups. Another ransomware attack in 2024, this time on CDK Global, a software firm that works with nearly 15,000 auto dealerships in North America, led to around $1 billion worth of losses for car dealers as a result of the three-week disruption.

Managing risk and mitigating downtime is a growing challenge for businesses. As organizations become ever more interconnected, the expanding surface of networks and the rapid adoption of technologies like AI are exposing new vulnerabilities—and more opportunities for threat actors. Cyberattacks are also becoming increasingly sophisticated and damaging as AI-driven malware and malware-as-a-service platforms turbocharge attacks.

To prepare for these challenges head on, companies must take a more proactive approach to security and resilience. “We’ve had a traditional way of doing things that’s actually worked pretty well for maybe 15 to 20 years, but it’s been based on detecting an incident after the event,” says Chris Millington, global cyber resilience technical expert at Hitachi Vantara. “Now, we’ve got to be more preventative and use intelligence to focus on making the systems and business more resilient.”

ACSI Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025 / American Customer Satisfaction Index LLC.","We always knew that consumers preferred Windows PCs over Macs, but the numbers now back it up.

HP topped Apple as the most preferred PC maker in the 2025 iteration of the American Customer Satisfaction Survey — though general consumer satisfaction with PCs fell slightly compared with 2024 sentiments. Big names, like Microsoft, suffered in the eyes of their consumer critics.

Customers polled by the survey, however, said that the overall design of computers has improved, and that they marked that aspect as the best of the computing experience. The worst? The agony of calling and then navigating through a call center to receive customer support.

ACSI, which runs the study, said that it sent out thousands of email surveys to random customers, and the 16,205 completed surveys it received were used as the foundation for its 2025 report. Customers were asked about their experiences with the largest customers as well as an “all other” category. The ACSI received customer inputs on expectations, quality perceptions, and perceptions of value and used them as inputs to generate a score.

The biggest slips in perceived quality were Apple, Microsoft, and Acer, all of which lost three points in the ACSI rankings. Last year, Apple topped the charts with a score of 85. Yet its score of 82 placed Apple second; Dell’s ACSI score also decreased by a point compared to 2024. However, ACSI assigned Dell a score of 83, making it the most popular computer company for 2025.

ACSI Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025 / American Customer Satisfaction Index LLC.

The ACSI also included tablets in this category, and added Amazon to its list of manufacturers. Tablet satisfaction scores plunged, from 81 in 2024 to 77 in 2025.

In general, computer satisfaction declined across every PC maker save Dell, which saw an increase in the satisfaction score from 2024’s 80 score to its 2025 score of 82.

ACSI measured several aspects of the computing experience — design, availability of software, ease of operation, graphics and sound quality, and more — and generally found that customers ranked them essentially the same as in 2024. Customers expressed the least satisfaction with a computer’s ability to prevent crashing, the general state of “features” like the OS or preloaded software, and call-center satisfaction. (They apparently hadn’t moved past our first review of Windows 11.)

ACSI Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025 / American Customer Satisfaction Index LLC.

“The service experience may be a factor in the deviating levels of satisfaction between desktops and tablets,” the ACSI found. “Manufacturers continue to expand their repair networks to connect users with convenient outlets for service, but high repair costs and inconsistent parts availability continue to hinder the service experience for some.”

Interestingly, customers ranked the desktop experience higher than that using a laptop, though aspects like “website satisfaction” should have been mostly thee same for both.

Still, the category with the most need for improvement isn’t PCs, but tablets. Amazon clearly has its work cut out for it.",https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image_d63dc1.png?w=1024,N,,2025-09-09 12:44:46.197089

Walmart will work with the artificial intelligence (AI) startup to develop a version of the program that is tailored to the retailer’s employees, according to Morris’ note.

“This training is designed to help you at work and in your personal life in an increasingly digital world,” Morris told employees in the note.

In the meantime, before the launch of OpenAI’s program, Walmart employees can access AI training and other training opportunities through the retailer’s Live Better U education benefit and can learn more about AI at work at ai.walmart.com, per the note.

When OpenAI announced that it will introduce OpenAI Certification, it said in a blog post that the program will be designed to help businesses ensure that candidates and employees know how to use AI.

The OpenAI program will include tools to help people prepare for the certification, will offer different levels of certification ranging from the basics to prompt engineering and will be able to become part of companies’ own learning and development programs.

OpenAI said in its blog post that Walmart is one of the program’s launch partners.

Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said in the post that the retailer knows that the future of retail will be defined by not only technology but also people who know how to use it.

“By bringing AI training directly to our associates, we’re putting the most powerful technology of our time in their hands — giving them the skills to rewrite the playbook and shape the future of retail,” Furner said.

Walmart said in June that it introduced AI tools that are available to employees through its associate app. The tools include one that gives associates clear guidance on where to focus their efforts by understanding, prioritizing and recommending tasks; a real-time translation feature that is available in 44 languages and facilitates multi-lingual conversations among employees and customers; and an upgraded conversational AI platform that can answer questions such as, “How can I process a return without a receipt?”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Walmart.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:47:37.408585

ID35,Publicis Groupe,2025-09-09 14:55:31+00:00,lbbonline.com,"If AI Takes “Our Jobs, It's Because We've Made Our Jobs Really Stupid”: Tom Goodwin | LBBOnline",LBB Editorial,,,,,https://lbbonline.com/news/tom-goodwin-adma-keynote-2025,"But the result is “we have made our jobs really, really robotic.
People have absolutely no idea what is a fad, what is a theme, what is a trend, what is a threat.
“It’s not automation, it’s elevation,” and “a wonderful excuse” to “rethink what marketing can be.” “It allows us to cast aside the way we've done things before.
It allows us to be more ambitious.” He argued that, even before AI’s meteoric rise, the industry moved away from the ‘big ad’ era categorised by campaigns like Carlton Draught’s ‘Big Ad’.
There are people going around saying marketing doesn't matter because bots are going to buy things from other bots.","Marketers and agency executives have stripped the humanity -- “the wonder, the creativity, the mystery, the brilliance” -- from creative jobs in an attempt to understand, implement, and reap the benefits of artificial intelligence, according to marketing consultant and futurist Tom Goodwin.

But the result is “we have made our jobs really, really robotic. So if AI does take our jobs, it's because we've made our jobs really stupid.”

During a keynote speech on-stage at ADMA’s Global Forum in Sydney earlier today, he continued, “If you walk around your agencies, if you walk around your departments, it's people on Excel. They're copying and pasting files. There are people finding the average of what worked before. There are people following best practice. There are people using the right hue of blue that performed the best.

“What we really have at the moment is this era of avera-tising or average-a-tising, where we're making stuff that's sort of plausible and sort of fine and sort of acceptable, and no one's going to get fired, and it kind of works, and it tests well, and it's got a call to action, but I don't think anyone's going to remember this stuff.

“If we are going to save $50,000 of production money, but we're going to produce ads that no one really remembers, and then we're going to spend $1 million on media because no one's remembering it, the economics don't really work out.”

AI is like teenage sex, he claimed, showing a photo of a father sitting down for a conversation with his son. “He's a bit confused by what it is. He feels like everyone else is doing it. He doesn't really know how to do it.” The same is true of marketers who believe they’re “missing a trick” with AI, because “there's a lot of fear and uncertainty and doubt” and “this idea that everyone they know is doing it and everyone's enjoying it and getting really good results.”

“People are completely lost. People have absolutely no idea what best practice looks like,” he continued. “People have absolutely no idea what they should be measuring. People have absolutely no idea what is a fad, what is a theme, what is a trend, what is a threat.

“We're genuinely scared. I think we don't want to talk about it. I think people are fearful for their jobs. They think there's something they should be doing. They think they're doing the wrong things. There's a very low level of confidence out there.”

Tom is the co-founder of consultancy All We Have is Now, ex-head of futures and insights at Publicis Groupe, author of ‘Digital Darwinism: Surviving the New Age of Business Disruption’, and the host of technology show ‘Edge’.

In his view, AI should result in inflated ambitions, not accelerated cost cutting. “It’s not automation, it’s elevation,” and “a wonderful excuse” to “rethink what marketing can be.”

“It allows us to cast aside the way we've done things before. It allows us to have conversations with different people about getting budgets. It allows us to be more ambitious.”

He argued that, even before AI’s meteoric rise, the industry moved away from the ‘big ad’ era categorised by campaigns like Carlton Draught’s ‘Big Ad’. “Whoever came up with that, I’d love to buy them a rosé,” he said of the iconic, 20-year-old ad made by George Patterson and Partners. The era of big ads made way for the era of efficiency, then effectiveness, and now, “we’re in this era of attribution.”

“I've got a TV, I've got a fridge, I've got laundry detergent. I've never clicked on any ads for this stuff. Every single ad that was sent to me online has failed. Every single TV ad, all of the stuff I watched when I was young, all of the print advertising in the TV times, that has succeeded, but in this new world of attribution, that all looks like a failure.”

“It makes no sense” to him that brands that “for hundreds of years [have] dominated in their categories” are hyper-fixated on influencer marketing or personalisation, for example. “This is crazy to me. This is completely crazy.”

“We've got people like Unilever talking about influencer marketing,” he said.

“We've got people like P&G [Procter & Gamble] talking about the need to have one-on-one conversations at scale. For me, and people will disagree on this, this makes no sense whatsoever. I don't want to have a conversation with Head & Shoulders ... I don't need to have a personalised advertising campaign for my flavour of barbecue crisps.”

Similarly, while the ad tech market was worth USD$876 billion in 2024, the ads consumers see are “largely crap” and “we are surrounded by enormously irrelevant advertising.”

He gave an example: After clicking on a car ad out of curiosity, he was “swamped with ads for cars” from all brands and price points. Even if he wanted to buy a car, “'Wait a minute, this is a bit late in the process, isn't it? Maybe we should have done some stuff to make you like our brand before that.'”

But despite the “delta between the promise of technology” and the ads “normal human beings” are served, and the fact “it’s quite unfashionable” right now to be optimistic or calm, Tom was hopeful. He declared brands have “never been more important”, acting as a shortcut to decision-making, “a reason to feel better” about those decisions, and a “way to convey status, who we are.”

“There are people who go around saying that brands are dead. There are people going around saying marketing doesn't matter because bots are going to buy things from other bots. It's absolute nonsense. Brands are the way that we navigate the world.”

“We’re trying to recreate the experience of working with a well-trained Ralph Lauren salesperson,” says David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, and son of the founder.
Twenty-five years ago, David appeared on stage with Bill Gates to unveil Polo.com, the very first Ralph Lauren website.
If you already have a blue blazer and turn to the Ask Ralph app for interesting ways to style it, the app will curate looks drawn from Ralph Lauren’s archives and style guide.
“I think of the Ask Ralph app as a kind of style book.","In the early 2000s, fashion brands had a realization: They could throw their inventory up on a website and ask customers to sift through it to find what they were looking for. Two decades later, the fundamental structure of e-commerce hasn’t changed much. Shopping is a drag that involves endlessly scrolling for merchandise.

But change is in the air. AI is about to transform everything about online shopping. Consumers are already turning to chatbots to find and compare products, and to platforms like Daydream that are designed specifically for shopping for clothes. Now, we’re about to see how fashion labels themselves can use AI to make shopping on their sites less laborious and more delightful.

Today, Ralph Lauren launches Ask Ralph, an AI stylist in the brand’s mobile app. The 58-year-old fashion brand has partnered with Microsoft to create an AI agent that mimics the experience of speaking with an stylist. You begin by expressing exactly what you’re looking for. Depending on the day, it might be specific like, “I’m looking for a black cardigan for the fall,” or open-ended like, “I’m moderating a panel at a big conference and I have no idea what to wear.”

Then, rather than sifting through rows of products, the app does the searching for you. It delivers fully styled looks from the current Ralph Lauren collection that you can shop immediately. And through the process, as you figure out what you’re looking for (say, cropped cardigans made of cashmere), the AI adapts to your preferences. “We’re trying to recreate the experience of working with a well-trained Ralph Lauren salesperson,” says David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, and son of the founder. “We’ve taken all of our own best practices and built them into the AI.”

An Early Adopter

This isn’t Ralph Lauren’s first partnership with Microsoft. Twenty-five years ago, David appeared on stage with Bill Gates to unveil Polo.com, the very first Ralph Lauren website. This was a time when few other fashion brands had any online presence at all.

David has always been interested in adopting new technologies early. Shortly after the new website debuted, David partnered with NBC to build an online magazine full of videos and articles to blend content with commerce; in the following years, it would become common for brands to launch blogs on their website. And Ralph Lauren was among the first fashion brand to place QR codes in billboard and print ads to send consumers to its website. “We did this before most phones were able to read QR codes,” says David. “But people quickly caught up.”

Ralph Lauren has been toying with the idea of a digital stylist for a long time. In the early 2000s, that early version of the e-commerce website had an “Ask Ralph” feature, where you could read content about how to put a Ralph Lauren look together, and even a video streaming service where you could talk to a salesperson in a showroom. “What we didn’t have at the time was AI,” David says. “We realized that AI could help us realize many of the concepts we had dreamt about back then.”

To train the Ask Ralph model, Microsoft used data from Ralph Lauren’s archives and current collections to help identify the brand’s distinct aesthetic. Ralph Lauren’s creative team, from designers to in-store stylists, participated in the process to make sure that the app would create highly curated looks that reflect the brand’s take on styling.

Then, members of the in-store team were asked to contribute insights about how they work with a customer to help them find pieces. Once they had created a beta version of the app, they asked employees to use it and offer feedback.

The final version of the app uses conversational AI and natural language processing to understand open-ended prompts from the user. It also incorporates the customer’s shopping history, so that it can understand their preferences and pick pieces that match what they already have in their closet.

The app can interpret context: It can identify whether the customer is trying to quickly buy a shirt to match an existing blazer, or whether they are just playing around to find new ideas for outfits. It also only shows pieces of clothing that are currently available for purchase, and over time, the app will adapt to the user.

The Industry Shift

While Ralph Lauren is an early adopter of AI technology, many fashion brands are building their own apps, says Shelley Bransten, corporate VP of global industry solutions at Microsoft. She says that the fashion industry is now shifting from “scroll-based” shopping, which involves looking through rows of thumbnails, to “goal-based” shopping, which deploys AI to surface results based on the customer’s specific needs at that moment. “The shopping experience is going to be more personalized, relevant, and more tied to the customer’s intent,” she says.

Bransten says that many consumers have gotten so used to using AI agents like ChatGPT that they no longer remember how to use search boxes on websites. Instead, they type out full queries into search boxes, only to confuse the system. But companies that have made the leap to using AI on their e-commerce sites are already seeing more success. “They’re seeing higher conversion rates, units per transaction, and consumer happiness scores,” she says.

At the same time, we should expect more general AI agents to improve. I recently wrote about Daydream, a shopping platform that allows you to describe what it is you’re looking for, then searches for pieces from hundreds of brands. It will tailor the results to your size, personal preferences, and budget. Soon, platforms like this are likely to replace searching for clothes on Google, but David believes that some customers will still want to search directly on brand websites. “We have loyal, long-term customers who trust us,” he says. “Ask Ralph is another way to deepen this relationship.”

Ask Ralph is designed to make shopping less time-consuming for the customer, but David also believes it is an opportunity for Ralph Lauren to stand out by emphasizing the brand’s unique point of view. The app will curate looks that are very carefully aligned with the distinct Ralph Lauren aesthetic, and in doing so, will allow customers to enter the brand’s universe. “Our customers come to us because they like our point of view,” David says. “We can help them create the look that they want more directly.”

The app could also be a way to bring new customers in. While it is designed to make the purchasing process easier, David hopes that it is also a useful free tool for anyone looking for help to get dressed in the morning. If you already have a blue blazer and turn to the Ask Ralph app for interesting ways to style it, the app will curate looks drawn from Ralph Lauren’s archives and style guide.

“People still read fashion magazines and blogs to look for tips about how to dress,” David says. “I think of the Ask Ralph app as a kind of style book. It helps you figure out how to put a look together in the morning.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-1-91397413-david-lauren-ralph-lauren.jpg",N,,2025-09-09 12:46:31.360720

The grocer has also moved this year to accelerate its retail media activities, announcing in July that it had hired a new executive to oversee Albertsons Media Collective.
And on Aug. 27, Albertsons detailed changes to its merchandising strategy that included reassigning several divisional leaders.
Despite the myriad changes Albertsons has implemented thus far in 2025, investors have signaled that they are underwhelmed.
Following is a recap of some of the most significant developments at Albertsons this year.","When Albertsons’ plan to merge with Kroger imploded spectacularly at the end of last year, analysts were quick to point out that the supermarket operator was up against the clock as it worked to regain its footing.

Albertsons seems to have felt the same way.

Days after former Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran declared during a Jan. 8 earnings call that Albertsons had to speed up its growth to keep pace with “the very, very best in the industry,” the company revealed that it was cutting an undisclosed number of corporate jobs. Albertsons also said early this year that more than 150 corporate workers at its marquee Safeway banner would lose their jobs as the company looked to cut costs. The company said in February that it was streamlining its divisional structure to “operate in new and innovative ways,” setting the stage for its March 3 announcement that Sankaran was retiring and would be replaced as Albertsons’ chief executive by Susan Morris, who had served as COO since 2018.

In May, Albertsons continued to shake up its leadership ranks through an overhaul that included the appointment of a new chief merchandising officer and a chief commercial officer. The grocer has also moved this year to accelerate its retail media activities, announcing in July that it had hired a new executive to oversee Albertsons Media Collective. And on Aug. 27, Albertsons detailed changes to its merchandising strategy that included reassigning several divisional leaders.

Despite the myriad changes Albertsons has implemented thus far in 2025, investors have signaled that they are underwhelmed. The company’s stock price is off by about 2% year to date, while shares in Kroger have gained more than 11%.

Our many connected gadgets often refuse to talk to each other, governed by a bewildering ecosystem of apps that add more frustration than freedom.

So, where did the grand vision for the IoT get lost? IoT News caught up with Chitresh Sharma, Head of the Europe Insights Factory at L’Oréal, who offers a blunt diagnosis. He believes the industry has been so obsessed with the tech itself that it has completely forgotten about the people it’s supposed to serve.

Moving past just ‘Things’

The early days of IoT were all about novelty. A fridge that could order milk! A toaster you could turn on from your phone! The problem, Sharma argues, is that we never moved past this fascination with the “things”. The real magic isn’t in connecting a single object; it’s in creating an environment that understands you.

“What excites me most about the future of IoT and connected technology is not the ‘things’ themselves, but the seamless, almost magical, symphony they can create,” he says. “It’s about crafting an ecosystem where technology fades into the background, anticipating our needs with an intuition that feels deeply human.”

Sharma envisions a near future where “our environment intelligently adapts to us, not the other way around.” This is the goalpost of IoT success we should be aiming for: experiences so smooth and personal that they feel less like technology and more like life, just better.

The IoT today is a mess of devices shouting into the void, and it’s a problem of our own making. Sharma is clear that the barrier isn’t technical; it’s a fundamental lack of vision.

“The greatest challenge plaguing the IoT industry is a risk taking capabilities and lack of failure to imagine,” he observes. “Companies are sometimes overly focused on silicon, sensors, and standards, churning out a fragmented mess of ‘smart’ gadgets that don’t speak the same language. They’re building products, not experiences.”

This gets to the heart of why so many smart devices feel so unsatisfying. They exist in isolation.

“The real challenge isn’t technical; it’s a crisis of design and vision,” Sharma states. “We must move beyond the bits and bytes to create something truly beautiful, intuitive, and integrated that people will not just use, but love.”

A trend that actually matters for IoT success

In an industry addicted to buzzwords, we asked Sharma what trend businesses should actually be watching. His initial response was to the point: “Stop chasing trends.”

But then he got serious, pointing to a shift that he believes will separate the true innovators from the gadget-makers.

“The one trend that truly matters… is the explosion of intelligence at the edge,” he declares. This is about ending our reliance on distant, anonymous data centres.

“Forget the cloud. The future isn’t about shipping dumb sensor data to a server farm hundreds of miles away to get an answer back. That’s slow, inefficient, and a massive privacy vulnerability.”

The real innovation is putting a powerful brain inside the device itself. By running sophisticated AI right on the hardware, things can understand and react to the world in real-time, all without needing to phone home.

What this means in practice is faster responses, better privacy, and experiences that are truly personal to you. As Sharma puts it, “This is the trend that will define the next decade, turning simple connected objects into truly intelligent companions.”

Please, no more smart toasters

We’ve all seen the proliferation of smart gadgets that solve problems we never had. This has fuelled a massive misconception about what IoT is even for, and what success looks like.

“The most prevalent and maddening misconception is that IoT is about slapping a chip on every object in your house and calling it ‘smart’,” Sharma says. “A connected toaster is not innovation; it’s a gimmick. It’s a solution in search of a problem.”

And he’s right. The point isn’t to complicate our lives with an app for every appliance; it’s about using deeply integrated technology to solve real problems in a simple, elegant way.

“The goal isn’t to complicate our lives with a thousand different apps for a thousand different devices,” Sharma stresses, “but to simplify it in a truly fundamental way.”

So, how can companies avoid building the next connected toaster? For Sharma, it comes down to one golden rule, a piece of advice he considers both simple and the hardest thing for a tech company to do.

“Start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology,” he advises. “Don’t you dare start with a piece of technology and then try to figure out where to sell it.”

It’s about obsessing over the user. It’s about asking “What beautiful, effortless experience can we create?” before you ever write a line of code or design a circuit board. This human-centric approach is the only way to create products that resonate on an emotional level.

Sharma’s final piece of advice for IoT success is one the entire industry should heed: “If you aren’t creating something that people will fall in love with, something that makes their life better in a meaningful way, then you’re just making another gadget. And the world has enough gadgets.”

Gill Capital said in a statement on Tuesday that through Google Cloud’s AI Cloud Takeoff (AI CTO) program, it has embarked on multiple AI innovation projects.

One of them involves embedding a gen AI-powered search agent into e-commerce websites and apps (iOS, Android) for H&M Indonesia and H&M Thailand.

Built using Vertex AI Search for Commerce, this AI agent understands the true intent behind search queries in natural language.

On the backend, the agent also automatically analyzes and organizes a vast product catalog, freeing staff up from the tedious task of researching and adding keywords to each product.

Going a step further, Gill Capital is integrating a conversational agent into these platforms.

Also developed using Vertex AI Search for Commerce, this agent serves as a virtual shopping assistant, surfacing personalized product recommendations through multi-turn conversation.

It also helps customers with more complex tasks like checking if an item is in stock at nearby stores.

After piloting these two solutions with an initial group of users, Gill Capital has validated their effectiveness in boosting engagement and sales.

There are now plans to roll them out for H&M Indonesia and H&M Thailand later this year.

US retail giant Walmart will open its first namesake-branded stores later this year, selling fresh groceries, essential household goods, apparel, and technology.

The Arkansas-headquartered retailer did not disclose how many stores it would be opening, but indicated it would use a variety of locally sourced products.

The announcement follows Walmart’s first growth summit held in SA in April, which featured suppliers from 12 African countries and led to the recruitment of small and medium-sized suppliers from SA and the rest of the continent.

Kath McLay, Walmart International president and CEO, said in a statement that Walmart’s South African stores would “offer a wide range of merchandise, including fresh groceries, household essentials, apparel and technology”.

“Walmart also will offer a variety of locally sourced products. By partnering with South African suppliers and entrepreneurs, Walmart will bring its signature ”everyday low prices” and global standards to the market, while celebrating the country’s rich culture”.

Walmart said sites were already in development, with the new stores set to open before the end of the year, with official opening dates to be announced in October.

It said customers could “also look forward to digital capabilities to enhance their shopping journey”.

Miles van Rensburg, president and CEO of Massmart, Walmart’s locally owned retail operation, said the group was “thrilled to begin this journey introducing the iconic Walmart brand to South African associates, customers and communities”.

Massmart’s other brands, such as Game, Builders, and Makro, will continue, with Walmart being another brand added to the local portfolio.

Sasfin Wealth senior equity analyst Alec Abraham said this move by Walmart was “probably inevitable”, adding that the US giant was looking to “leverage off the Walmart brand and possibly gain off that” locally.

He said recent entries into SA from international brands, such as Amazon, had seen them coming in and adopting their own branding.

Abraham believed Walmart hoped to “gain a bit of traction due to the pool of brand equity it has”.

“I think, like any new entrant, there will be an initial excitement with people wanting to go and see what the offering is like. Then it will be up to Walmart to see if they can sustain that initial footfall, once everyone has checked out what they are offering.”

Anchor investment analyst Steph Erasmus said more competition entering the South African market was “great for the consumer”, especially a “very big brand like Walmart”.

He said it remained to be seen, though, how the US retailer would expand these Walmart-branded stores. He pointed out that in the group’s initial entry into SA about 12 years ago, it had not been successful in taking market share from the likes of Shoprite.

“Are they [Walmart] going to go flat out and try to take market share, or is it going to just be a little foray into South Africa? I am not sure how they are going to play this.”",https://news24cobalt.24.co.za/resources/029d-1eae0f9cefaa-66a98bdd5748-1000/format/inline/gettyimages-2230322326.jpeg,N,,2025-09-09 12:47:47.876688

Only 21 per cent of organisations currently have sufficient, high-quality data to train and fine-tune AI models.
""With rising citizen demands and stretched resources, public sector organisations recognise the ways in which AI can help them do more with less.
However, the ability to deploy Gen AI and agentic AI depends on having rock-solid data foundations,"" said Marc Reinhardt, Public Sector Global Industry Leader at Capgemini.","Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is set to gain wider use across government organisations in the coming years, according to new research from the Capgemini Research Institute.

Agentic AI, which can make autonomous decisions, is seen as a natural extension of this momentum as governments seek to streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and respond more effectively to complex social challenges.

The study reveals that 90 per cent of public sector organisations intend to explore, pilot, or roll out agentic AI within the next two to three years.

Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of public sector bodies are experimenting with or deploying generative AI (Gen AI) to strengthen service delivery.

Data as the weak link

Despite enthusiasm, data readiness remains a pressing hurdle. Only 21 per cent of organisations currently have sufficient, high-quality data to train and fine-tune AI models. While leaders see the potential for AI to address rising citizen demands with limited resources, weak data foundations continue to slow progress.

""With rising citizen demands and stretched resources, public sector organisations recognise the ways in which AI can help them do more with less. However, the ability to deploy Gen AI and agentic AI depends on having rock-solid data foundations,"" said Marc Reinhardt, Public Sector Global Industry Leader at Capgemini.

The study highlights that in the next two to three years, 39 per cent of organisations will assess feasibility, 45 per cent will begin pilot programmes, and 6 per cent expect to scale existing agentic AI initiatives. Sectors such as defence (82 per cent), healthcare (75 per cent), and security (70 per cent) are particularly active in adopting generative AI solutions.

Security, trust, and skills concerns

Adoption, however, is not without hesitation. As many as 79 per cent of executives cited data security as a leading concern, while 74 per cent expressed doubts about trusting AI-generated outputs. The report suggests that governments must create stronger governance frameworks and data infrastructures to build confidence in these technologies.

The research also points to slow organisational progress in developing AI skills and promoting data sharing. Only 12 per cent of respondents said they were very advanced in activating data effectively, and just 7 per cent rated themselves mature in building AI-related skills.

Although every organisation surveyed reported current or planned data sharing initiatives, most efforts (65 per cent) are stuck at the planning or pilot phase. Challenges related to cloud infrastructure, sovereignty of AI systems, and privacy concerns continue to limit progress, even though data sharing is central to improving model performance and policy outcomes.

Leadership roles expand

Governments are also turning to specialised leadership roles to address these challenges. The report notes that 64 per cent of public sector organisations already have a Chief Data Officer in place, while another 24 per cent plan to appoint one. Similarly, 27 per cent currently employ a Chief AI Officer, and 41 per cent intend to establish this position in the future.

Reinhardt noted, ""Going forward, governments can be more agile and effective as AI augments the work of government employees to source information, conduct policy analysis, make decisions, and answer citizen queries.""",https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1757424288-TheIntegrationofGenerativeArtificialIntelligenceGenAIintoe-commerceentertainmentandothersectorsisopeningnewdoorsformarketerstomakecustomerexperiencemoreseamles-2025-09-09T184359833.jpg?format=pjeg&auto=webp,N,,2025-09-09 12:43:59.476884

The ruling comes as part of a broader lawsuit unrelated to his resignation but entangled with it through discovery demands.
Jewel, known for her 1990s hits, sought damages exceeding $7 million, claiming Kroger failed to fulfill promotional and financial commitments.
For Kroger, now navigating a proposed $25 billion merger with Albertsons Cos., the decision averts potential distractions.
Sources from Fox News earlier highlighted the irony of a pop star’s lawsuit prying open corporate secrets, though the recent decision closes that door.","In a surprising turn of events in the ongoing legal saga surrounding Kroger Co.’s former chief executive, a judge has ruled that Rodney McMullen will not be compelled to undergo deposition questioning about the circumstances of his abrupt resignation earlier this year. The decision, handed down in Hamilton County, Ohio, shields McMullen from what could have been a revealing probe into his departure, which the company attributed to personal conduct issues.

McMullen, who led the supermarket giant for nearly a decade and had been with Kroger for almost five decades, stepped down in March amid an internal investigation. His exit left industry observers puzzled, especially given the $11 million in compensation he forfeited. The ruling comes as part of a broader lawsuit unrelated to his resignation but entangled with it through discovery demands.

The Unlikely Intersection of Corporate Drama and Celebrity Litigation

The case stems from a 2023 contract dispute involving singer-songwriter Jewel and her business partners, who accused Kroger of breaching agreements related to the Wellness Experience festival. Jewel, known for her 1990s hits, sought damages exceeding $7 million, claiming Kroger failed to fulfill promotional and financial commitments. As the litigation progressed, plaintiffs pushed for details on McMullen’s resignation, arguing it could illuminate Kroger’s corporate culture and ethical standards.

Court documents revealed that an earlier judicial order had required McMullen to provide a written explanation of his exit, described by some as potentially “embarrassing.” According to reporting from Business Insider, this stemmed from the judge’s view that the information was relevant to assessing the company’s oversight and decision-making processes.

Shifting Judicial Winds and Corporate Protections

However, the latest ruling reverses course, determining that further questioning of McMullen is unnecessary. The judge cited sufficient prior disclosures and the tangential nature of the resignation to the core festival dispute. This development, detailed in a recent article by Business Insider, highlights the challenges of balancing discovery rights with executive privacy in high-profile cases.

For Kroger, now navigating a proposed $25 billion merger with Albertsons Cos., the decision averts potential distractions. Industry insiders note that such probes can unearth sensitive details, affecting stock performance and regulatory scrutiny. McMullen’s resignation announcement vaguely referenced conduct inconsistent with company policy, fueling speculation but no public specifics.

Implications for Executive Accountability in Retail Giants

Legal experts suggest this case underscores broader tensions in corporate governance, where personal misconduct allegations often remain veiled under confidentiality agreements. As CNN Business reported, the lawsuit’s connection to Jewel added an unusual celebrity dimension, potentially amplifying public interest in what might otherwise be a routine contract spat.

The ruling also dismisses some of Jewel’s claims while allowing others to proceed to trial, keeping the spotlight on Kroger’s event sponsorship practices. For executives like McMullen, who transitioned to a non-executive chairman role before fully departing, it reinforces protections against invasive inquiries.

Broader Industry Ripples and Future Precedents

In the retail sector, where leaders face intense scrutiny amid economic pressures like inflation and supply-chain disruptions, this outcome may encourage companies to fortify internal investigations against external exposure. Sources from Fox News earlier highlighted the irony of a pop star’s lawsuit prying open corporate secrets, though the recent decision closes that door.

As Kroger presses forward with its merger ambitions, blocked in some jurisdictions over antitrust concerns, the McMullen saga serves as a reminder of how personal narratives can intersect with business strategy. While the full story of his resignation remains opaque, the judge’s protection ensures it won’t be dissected in this particular courtroom, leaving room for speculation but no definitive answers.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-7dff67bf-44e3-417e-a821-fca62fb5488e.jpeg,N,,2025-09-09 10:06:58.262821

Dozens of people from across the country, including one in our state, got sick from one of those meals linked to a salmonella outbreak.

As meal delivery grows in popularity, we’re looking into whether it’s a better option.

“I am very, very busy,” Genesis Robles, of Cromwell, said.

Time is money and for some, money is enough to get food quickly.

“I didn’t really want to think about the meals that I wanted to make and just something different,” Kassandra Ramirez, of Hartford, said.

That’s why these people signed up for meal delivery services.

“I just needed some extra help with getting some food on the table with my busy schedule and everything,” Robles said.

Local

Marketing research firm Statista shows Gen Z and Millennials are the majority of customers when it comes to meal delivery services. A big reason why is convenience.

They’re looking to eat healthier with easy meal planning – that they can just keep in the fridge.

“They deliver right to your front door, like it’s lovely,” Robles said.

But that convenience can come at a price at times. The CDC issued an alert that four different entrees from the company Metabolic Meals, caused a salmonella outbreak with 16 cases across 10 states including one case in Connecticut.

The affected entrees had a best buy date in beginning of the August. The CDC said the company is working with investigators and has reached out to customers who purchased these meals in question.

Most of them contained chicken, which registered dietitian Teresa Dotson said is susceptible to salmonella.

“You have to make sure that it's cooked and it's cooked to the proper temperature,” she said.

Dotson understands the appeal of meal delivery services, but said grocery shopping for the same ingredients is generally cheaper. She said it comes down to choosing between time or money.

“What is your time worth versus what is what is the cost of the meal?” she said.

Dotson said making healthy meals doesn’t have to be complicated or limited to just fresh fruits and vegetables.

“You can buy frozen fruits and vegetables that cut down on your prep time,” she said.

For some, the meal delivery services became too expensive, and they decided to go back to grocery shopping figuring it was now worth their time.

“It was awesome to get everything that you needed, but I think it was just too much,” Ramirez said.

The fintech powerhouse, valued at an impressive $75 billion, is ramping up activities in Paris where it is in pursuit of a French banking license. The company plans to hire up to 200 staff and allocate a substantial €1 billion investment to support its expansion efforts.

From Société Générale to Fintech Innovator

Oudéa, a seasoned leader who guided Société Générale through 15 transformative years post-global financial crisis, sees his new role as an exciting avenue to participate in a bold venture combining cutting-edge technology with robust financial backing. With ambitions to double its French customer base to 10 million by next year, Revolut is gearing up to launch mortgage and savings products tailored for the French market.

Globally, the neobank now caters to approximately 60 million customers, eclipsing traditional banking giants like HSBC. The company reported an impressive 72 percent revenue increase last year, which amounted to £3.1 billion. Its bid for a banking license in France adds to its existing EU authorization from Lithuania, though its UK banking license remains under regulatory scrutiny since 2024.

Swiss Operations Remain Unchanged—For Now

Despite Oudéa’s new moniker as Western Europe chairman, Revolut reassured that operations in Switzerland will remain unaffected in the immediate term. The company indicated in a communication “For our Swiss customers, nothing changes for now.” With whispers of a possible Swiss banking license in the air, the company is clearly not resting on its laurels.

Apple is frequently at the top of various surveys about the company and its products. However, while it is no stranger to the top of hardware and software lists, it does occasionally slip down the table.

This is precisely the case for the 2025 edition of ACSI's Household Appliance and Electronics Study, which studies how consumers value the various producers of electronics.

For the 2025 list, customer satisfaction for personal computers, which includes Mac and iPad users, has maintained its overall market-wide score of 81 from its 2024 result. When it comes to individual scores, there are quite a few changes that affect the standings.

While it occupied the top of the board in 2024 with its score of 85, Apple did see a 4% dip in its rating to 82. Unfortunately for Apple, this has let HP slip into first place.

In 2024, HP was at 84, which was enough for second place. While HP has also dropped for the 2025 chart, it only went down to 83 and for Apple to drop behind.

Apple is in joint second place on the chart, sharing the position with Dell which grew from 80 to 82. Samsung is in fourth after moving from a score of 82 to 81, while Lenovo's one-point slip lands it in fifth place.

They note that Boston Scientific and Elutia had a pre-existing partnership to distribute the bioenvelope products.
We believe the EluPro bioenvelope may offer clinical and handling advantages over TYRX and expect this to be a relatively low-effort product sale for BSX reps,” the analysts wrote.","Elutia (Nasdaq:ELUT) announced today that it agreed to sell its bioenvelope technologies to Boston Scientific for $88 million.

Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Elutia agreed to sell its EluPro and CanGaroo drug-eluting bioenvelopes in the cash deal. It designed these technologies to protect patients receiving implantable medical devices.

Elutia says the deal underscores the value of its proprietary drug-eluting biologic technology platform. It also allows the company to complete the development and commercialization of its near-term pipeline without the need for shareholder dilution.

The company designed EluPro to prevent post-operative complications in patients with implantable cardiac devices. Those include pacemakers and internal defibrillators. The system received FDA clearance in June 2024 and also has approval for use with additional devices. That extends to neuromodulators and neurostimulators for pain management, epilepsy, incontinence and sleep apnea.

CanGaroo is a porcine small intestine submucosa extracellular matrix that creates a healthy pocket for implanted devices. The bioenvelope stabilizes the implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, as well.

Boston Scientific develops a number of implantable devices, including leading defibrillators and pacemakers.

“EluPro has clearly demonstrated that our proprietary drug-eluting biologics platform works at scale,” said Dr. Randy Mills, CEO of Elutia. “With the successful launch of EluPro, seven national group purchasing organization contracts secured and more than 160 value analysis committee approvals, we have shown that we can develop, manufacture and commercialize these highly regulated breakthrough products, and that they are valued by physicians.

The company now plans to move forward with its NXT-41x, a next-gen antibiotic biomatrix for breast reconstruction. It expects this deal to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

The analysts’ take on the Elutia-Boston Scientific deal

BTIG analysts Marie Thibault, Sam Eiber and Alexandra Pang say the market opportunity for Elutia’s technology registers at around $600 million in the U.S.

They note that Boston Scientific and Elutia had a pre-existing partnership to distribute the bioenvelope products. Notably, they say it positions the company to compete against Medtronic in the cardiac rhythm management (CRM) space with its TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope.

“We see this as a strong fit for BSX, since the bioenvelope technology can be used for many of the implantable devices in its portfolio. Moreover, it gives the company the ability to offer a product that competes against long-standing incumbent Medtronic’s TYRX pouch. We believe the EluPro bioenvelope may offer clinical and handling advantages over TYRX and expect this to be a relatively low-effort product sale for BSX reps,” the analysts wrote. “While there could potentially be other interested acquirers (any ICD/pacemaker manufacturer), we do not expect additional bidders, since BSX and Elutia already have a close partnership. The transaction is expected to close in Q4. Our estimates remain unchanged.”",https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Elutia-EluPro-drug-eluting-bioenvelope-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:43:08.897034

The organization launched the First Penguin Net Generation Leadership program earlier this year to provide opportunities for young professionals in the frozen and refrigerators CPG and retail sectors. Program participants will be spotlighted at the 2025 NFRA Convention, slated for Oct. 18-21 in Orlando, Fla.

Progressive Grocer recently spoke with Kate Landis, senior director of marketing at NFRA, about the program that is poised to shape the next generation of leaders in this space.

Progressive Grocer: How has the Fresh Penguin grown and resonated in the industry, and how does that bode well for the future of leadership in this sector?

Kate Landis: NFRA’s First Penguin Next Generation Leadership Program has quickly become a beacon of what’s possible when we invest in the rising stars of frozen and refrigerated foods. Inspired by the idea of the “first penguin” — the one brave enough to jump first — the program has resonated deeply across our membership because it speaks to the courage, innovation, and collaboration this industry thrives on.

The inaugural class has already demonstrated that the program is more than leadership training and development; it’s a catalyst for industry progress. Through collaborative workshops, guided retail tours, monthly industry webinars, and year-long group case studies on critical challenges like supply chain resilience, category innovation, and marketing to Gen Z, our First Penguins are tackling the very issues shaping the future of our business. Their work proves that leadership development and industry problem-solving can and should go hand in hand.

The energy around the program bodes incredibly well for our future. It signals that the frozen and dairy sectors are not only cultivating talent but also preparing visionary leaders who are ready to take bold leaps forward.",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2025-09/frozen_leaders_teaser_1744324727321_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 11:17:55.677337

Over eight in ten (83%) organizations identify the creation of a unified software platform as a key component of their software-driven mobility strategy.","Paris – The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation as software becomes increasingly central to its business strategy and operations. According to a new report from the Capgemini Research Institute, ‘The software-driven mobility era: Beyond vehicles’, nearly all automotive organizations (92%) now anticipate that every automotive company will transition to a software company to support Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM) services. Over eight in ten believe that software-defined products and services, not just the physical vehicle, will become their core value proposition.

According to the report, while ambitions are strong, less than half of automotive organizations have scaled their SDM initiatives in 2025: 34% have partially scaled at least one SDM use case, and just 14% have achieved full-scale deployment.

While decoupling hardware and software has emerged as crucial to enable faster innovation, drive improved scalability, and unlock new revenue streams, the survey shows that only one in ten original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has made progress in this journey, with just over a quarter actively piloting new approaches.

“For decades, automotive leadership was driven by hardware but today consumers demand connected, digitally enhanced experiences. This calls for adoption of a software first approach across the value chain to enable holistic mobility solutions,” said Laurence Noël, Global Head of Automotive at Capgemini. “Forward–looking automotive organizations are already treating software as their core product and leveraging key partnerships to expand their ecosystem. While the ambition is high, it requires a complete organizational overhaul. Those that align their talent, platforms, and partnerships, while fostering trust and delivering an elevated customer experience, will stay ahead of the curve.”

Strategic partnerships and ecosystem collaboration are accelerating the shift to SDM

According to the report, automotive organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with big tech and hyperscalers for critical software, cloud, and data capabilities. While only a few have established joint ventures so far, a third plan to do so within three years. Up to 84% are exploring new supplier markets to build resilience, and nearly 70% are doubling down on in-house development of key components to retain control over brand-defining technologies. Organizations are also restructuring their supply chains for geopolitical resilience, by exploring new sourcing markets including India, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe.

Software-defined products and mobility services are also expected to become significant revenue contributors for OEMs. According to the report, their share of OEMs’ total revenue is projected to double, contributing to over 50% by 2035.

AI is driving a new era of innovation in the auto industry

The report highlights that a vast majority (85%) agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, embedded directly into software features and functions, from improving in-vehicle experiences to powering advanced safety features and cybersecurity.

Over three-quarters (77%) see AI integration into software development, in-vehicle functions, and mobility services as a critical competitive advantage that will reshape the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, boosting productivity and efficiency, and enhancing product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation. Notably, most surveyed organizations view AI integration for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) and autonomous driving capabilities as extremely significant in their organization’s software-driven strategy.

Software-driven mobility demands an organizational overhaul to reap its full potential

According to the survey, most organizations (86%) believe SDM strategy demands an overhaul of the organizational model, leading to significant changes in processes, and the need to build new skill sets. In addition to structural changes, organizations face a range of challenges in software engineering, compliance, safety, cybersecurity, leadership, and talent acquisition. Over eight in ten (83%) organizations identify the creation of a unified software platform as a key component of their software-driven mobility strategy.

Report Methodology

In June 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 600 executives from 200 long-established automotive organizations, with no more than four respondents from each organization. These executives represented organizations across four segments: OEMs, suppliers, mobility service providers, and digital natives from countries across North America, Europe, and APAC.

The report -- Cyber Claims Unveiled: A Focused Study on Trends, Threats, and Tailored Solutions -- provides an in-depth analysis of 300+ cyber claims, revealing trends in incident types, severity, causes of loss, triggered insurance agreements, industry-specific risks, and insights into risk management practices.

According to Fran Gari, Head of Pricing, Global Cyber and the lead author of the report, ""This report highlights a vital truth in the cyber risk landscape: a limited number of high-value claims account for the bulk of total losses, emphasizing the value for businesses in effective cybersecurity measures and proactive risk management strategies to provide effective protection and limit potential disruption in today's digital environment. Conducting a thorough examination of claims over an extended period is essential for uncovering evolving trends and patterns in cyber incidents.""

""Our claims analysis reveals some very promising trends,"" said Danielle Roth, Head of Cyber Claims for AXA XL in the Americas. ""Shorter shutdown durations, an increasing number of companies successfully detecting breaches independently, and in less time. All of these improvements show that organizations are becoming more resilient and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts.""

According to Andrew Farr, AXA XL's Global Chief Underwriting Officer for Financial Lines, ""The data tells us a story. By understanding the narratives of our most prominent cyber claims, AXA XL can leverage our own experiences to improve underwriting practices, develop new products, adjust risk pricing strategies, and enhance our risk management solutions, ultimately providing better protection against future cyber risks for our insured clients.""

Key findings from the analysis include:

Rising Severity of Claims: The analysis shows an increasing severity of large claims, particularly related to ransomware incidents.

Ransomware as a Dominant Threat: Since around 2018, ransomware has emerged as a leading cause of large claims, affecting 54.3% of claims in recent years. This trend emphasizes the need for tailored underwriting and proactive policy design.

Improvements in Detection: There is a notable shift where a growing proportion of data breach incidents are being identified by insureds themselves rather than external parties. Prior to 2019, only 35.7% of attacks were flagged internally, since then some 66% of incidents were detected by the insured themselves. This suggests that enhanced monitoring capabilities within organizations are having an impact.

Industry Specific Insights: The report highlights how claims experience and overall impact from cyber incidents varies across industry sectors. For instance, ransomware claims in certain industry sectors, such as manufacturing or retail, have a greater propensity to trigger business interruption compared to others. Larger organizations experience a higher frequency of large claims due to their extensive networks and greater exposure to risks, with both healthcare and financial services experiencing higher relative frequencies of large claims compared to other industries.

The French firm has been touted as a European AI champion as technological sovereignty concerns fester between the European Union and the United States under President Donald Trump.
Mistral chief executive Arthur Mensch said its AI could help ASML ""solve current and future engineering challenges"" in both hardware and software.
Mensch co-founded Mistral in 2023 after working for Google's DeepMind AI division, while fellow founders Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix previously worked at Meta's AI lab.
As well as text, Mistral offers generative AI models capable of turning out images and computer code.","France's Mistral on Tuesday cemented its position as Europe's top AI hope against far larger US and Chinese competitors after a record fundraising round and a tie-up with chipmaking equipment heavweight ASML.

The 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) cash infusion values Mistral at 11.7 billion euros, double its heft last year but a fraction of the $183 billion price tag placed on US firm Anthropic this month.

ASML, a key producer of the machines that churn out the chips powering artificial intelligence models, was the lead investor, stumping up 1.3 billion euros to give the Dutch company an 11 percent stake in Mistral.

The French firm has been touted as a European AI champion as technological sovereignty concerns fester between the European Union and the United States under President Donald Trump.

""By bringing together a world-class industrial firm and a leading French startup, Europe is demonstrating its ability to build strong digital sovereignty,"" Clara Chappaz, digital minister in the French government MPs voted out of office on Monday, told AFP.

The Dutch firm's boss Christophe Fouquet said he hoped for ""innovative products and solutions enabled by AI,"" from the deal.

Mistral chief executive Arthur Mensch said its AI could help ASML ""solve current and future engineering challenges"" in both hardware and software.

ASML said it would gain a seat on Mistral's strategic committee, giving the Dutch firm ""an advisory role in Mistral AI's future strategy and technology decisions"".

ASML's Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen will assume this role.

- 'Real alternative' -

Mistral's fundraising comes after months of rumours that it could be the target of a takeover bid by Apple, which has lagged other tech giants in developing its own AI.

The latest funding round ""reaffirms the company's independence"", Mistral said in its statement.

The company said that the founders together retain majority control.

But tying Mistral more closely into the wider European high-tech sector through ASML was necessary to compete, the founder of AI and data firm Ekimetrics Jean-Baptiste Bouzige told AFP.

""There's no way to be in the fight in this sector while remaining strictly French,"" he said, adding that ""Europe is the appropriate scale"" for a company like Mistral.

""Mistral can set itself up as an indispensable European player,"" benefiting from ""ASML's industrial legitimacy that can increase its visibility in the ecosystem"" worldwide, EY partner Franck Sebag commented.

Other players in the latest investment round included chip giant Nvidia, venture capital funds Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz and French public investment bank Bpifrance.

Mensch co-founded Mistral in 2023 after working for Google's DeepMind AI division, while fellow founders Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix previously worked at Meta's AI lab.

The company said Tuesday that it has so far amassed client contracts worth 350 million euros a year.

It has opened offices in Paris, London, Luxembourg, New York, California's Palo Alto tech hub and Singapore. It has expanded to over 350 staff.

- Bet on 'open source' -

Mistral's key products include Le Chat, a large language model (LLM) chatbot competing with the likes of ChatGPT from the sector's American heavyweight OpenAI.

But OpenAI, headed by Sam Altman, operates on a different scale: It is reportedly in talks to allow employees to sell shares at a $500 billion valuation.

As well as text, Mistral offers generative AI models capable of turning out images and computer code.

One factor setting it apart has been its practice from the beginning of releasing ""open source"" versions of its AI models, allowing other developers to run and modify them for their own purposes.

This year Mistral has announced a slew of partnerships, including with American chip giant Nvidia to create a cloud computing platform, or with Saudi investment fund MGX to build an AI campus outside Paris.

The company's 3 lines of business include retail and commercial banking, finance, investment, and market banking, and profit management, brokerage, and pension fund management. As of 2023, Wells Fargo managed $1.4 trillion in current deposits and $936.7 billion in current loans.

Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) presented at the Wells Fargo 20th Annual Healthcare Conference 2025, highlighting its strategic growth and challenges. The company reported robust top-line growth driven by the Pharma and CAM sectors, despite facing tariff-related margin pressures. Agilent remains optimistic about future growth through innovation and strategic investments.

Key Takeaways

Agilent reported a core revenue growth of 6%, with strong contributions from Pharma and CAM sectors. Tariffs impacted margins, but mitigation strategies are in place, with improvements expected by 2026. The company anticipates continued growth driven by downstream QA/QC in Pharma and reshoring activities in the U.S. Agilent’s service business satisfaction scores exceeded 90%, reflecting strong customer relationships. The company is strategically positioned in China, with local manufacturing and competitive pricing strategies.

Financial Results

Agilent showcased a solid financial performance in its third quarter: Core revenue growth was 6%, with double-digit growth in Pharma. CDMO saw a 20% increase, with bookings extending into 2026. Tariffs resulted in a 200 basis point decline in margins, but a 230 basis point increase is expected from Q3 to Q4. China contributed $300 million in revenue this quarter.

Operational Updates

Agilent highlighted significant operational progress: The Affinity III chromatography instrument experienced mid-teens growth, driven by productivity gains. The 8,850 GC instrument replacement cycle has begun, indicating potential for future growth. The NASD platform grew over 20% in Q3, with bookings secured into 2027. BioVectra has been booked well into 2026 and beyond.

Future Outlook

Agilent remains optimistic about its future prospects: Tariff impacts are expected to decrease through 2026, potentially becoming a tailwind. Long-term growth is anticipated from QA/QC in Pharma and U.S. reshoring efforts. The company expects steady improvement in China, with a strong win rate in the country’s stimulus programs.

In a press release, Walmart explained the state-of-the-art facility is designed to receive and process fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for delivery to 180 Walmart stores.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center, marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, executive vice president, Supply Chain, Walmart U.S.

The Lyman area facility is the third of five new high-tech PDCs Walmart is opening nationwide, marking a significant milestone in the company’s supply chain transformation, Walmart added. These facilities leverage advanced automation to process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution center. Prior to Wellsford, the retailer had opened automated PDCs in Shafter, California (2021) and Lancaster, Texas (2023), with two more planned: one in Belvidere, Illinois and another in Pilesgrove, New Jersey. These PDCs leverage technology from warehouse automation company Witron, as Walmart noted in this announcement about its high-tech PDC network plans.

“South Carolina continues to lead in innovation and logistics, and Walmart’s investment in Spartanburg County is driving that momentum forward,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. “Through advanced supply chain technology and a strong commitment to local sourcing, we’re proud to partner with Walmart to deliver fresh, affordable food to communities across our state and the region.”

Walmart is reshaping associates’ work by integrating technology that removes some of their most physically demanding tasks, Walmart added. For example, robotics now handle the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

Associates at the facility work alongside the high-tech systems that build store-specific pallets, ensuring fragile items like eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top, to minimize product damage. AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness. This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.

The facility is home to more than 600 full-time Walmart associates with ongoing opportunities for career growth and development. Walmart is currently hiring a variety of roles, including automation equipment operators, the company pointed out.

“We are thrilled to welcome Walmart to the Lyman community. Walmart’s new high-tech facility is a powerful investment in our future – creating hundreds of quality jobs and bringing lasting career opportunities across the Upstate,” said Lyman Mayor Glenn Greer. “This milestone not only strengthens Lyman but also positions our region for continuing economic growth in the coming years.”

During the celebration, Walmart awarded $15,000 in grants to the following local non-profit organizations: local food pantry, Greer Relief; STEM-focused public school, Wellford Academy of Science and Technology; area soup kitchen, Breaking Bread for Jesus and foster care support provider, PS I Love You Ministries. In FYE 2024, Walmart stores, clubs and the Walmart Foundation donated $16.8 million in cash and in-kind donations to local organizations in South Carolina.

(Reuters) - Paris prosecutors opened a criminal probe into in June over its recall of sleep apnea devices, probing possible charges including aggravated fraud and failure to report safety incidents that could cause death, they said on Monday.

The 2021 recall affected about 15 million machines worldwide, including 350,000 in France, after concerns emerged that degrading polyurethane foam could cause health problems ranging from headaches and respiratory irritation to potential cancer risks.

The Paris Public Health division confirmed on Monday that it had received 104 individual complaints, prosecutors said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

The judicial investigation was formally opened on June 12 after a preliminary inquiry by the Central Office for the Fight against Environmental and Public Health Damage (OCLAESP).

In response, a Philips spokesperson said this is not a new investigation.

""Ongoing proceedings launched in 2023 cover the alleged activities of Philips in the lead up to and during 2021 recall. The proceeding does not make allegations about the quality and safety of products currently marketed in France by Philips.""

The company will continue to engage constructively in the required court processes, the spokesperson told Reuters.

The fraud charges in the Philips case carry severe criminal penalties under French law. For aggravated fraud involving endangering human health, individuals face up to seven years’ imprisonment and fines of 750,000 euros, while corporations can be fined up to 3.75 million euros, prosecutors said.

Last year, Philips agreed to pay $1.1 billion (937.5 million euros) to settle related litigation in the United States.

Renner, an about 60-year-old firm whose largest shareholder is BlackRock BLK, runs almost 700 stores in Brazil.

""The second half of the year will see lower growth,"" Chief Financial Officer Daniel Martins told Reuters in an interview on Friday, without providing specific details on the expected performance.

The executive said that the level of Brazil's benchmark interest rate, which is currently at a near 20-year high, has been affecting consumers, making them more selective.

For the third quarter, which ends this month, he said there would be an effect from a tougher comparison base year-on-year, as a warmer than usual autumn in Brazil last year postponed purchases to the third quarter.

However, Martins said he expected Renner's earnings to recover from then on, with a stronger fourth quarter and a more positive outlook for 2026.

He said eventual lower interest rates in Brazil next year could allow credit, through Renner's financial arm Realize, to have a greater contribution to the group's sales, although he noted this potential move would be made carefully.

Besides struggling with interest rate levels, Brazilian fashion retailers have been also seeing growing competition from foreign rivals, especially Asian firms such as Shein, which has said the country is one of its five main markets globally.

Kyle Watson, previously the company’s chief marketing officer, will be responsible for overseeing brand equity, marketing and deepening consumer loyalty across the portfolio. JoBeth Fink will oversee Celsius’ creative vision. Fink joined Celsius as part of its recent purchase of Alani Nu.

Celsius also named Rishi Daing as chief marketing officer. He has more than two decades of global marketing and commercial leadership experience, including senior roles at PepsiCo and Mark Anthony Brands.

Dive Insight:

Just a year ago, Celsius’ portfolio consisted predominantly of its namesake beverage, whichgenerated $1.36 billion in revenue, up sharply from $17 million in 2015. During the past eight months, the Florida-based company has purchased rival Alani Nu for $1.8 billion and recently added Rockstar to the mix as part of a deal announced last month with PepsiCo.

The transaction included PepsiCo upping its stake in Celsius to 11% while the beverage giant agreed to incorporate Alani Nu into its distribution system in the U.S. and Canada.

Celsius now possesses a portfolio that will require more attention to grow sales and recognition. The brands also appeal to different audiences, which will increase demand for marketing and brand expertise.

Levi Strauss has successfully increased prices on select products without seeing a decline in demand, indicating resilience among wealthier consumers.

Retailers are utilizing advanced consumer-tracking technology to implement targeted promotions, allowing them to maintain higher profit margins while testing consumer willingness to pay full prices.

A handful of apparel retailers including Levi Strauss are teasing more full-priced products, testing how much wealthier shoppers are willing to pay despite the sobering effect of tariffs.

They have not been disappointed so far.

Levi's raised prices on some products in July but saw no slowdown in demand, the denim maker's chief financial officer, Harmit Singh, said at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference in New York on Wednesday.

""We are making a full-court press in selling higher full-price sales than we have done in the past,"" he said. ""The Levi's consumer largely earns $100,000 and over. And that consumer we are seeing is generally resilient."" Ralph Lauren RL.N, Under Armour UAA.N and Abercrombie & Fitch ANF.N are also leaning into a more full-price strategy, they said, in recent earnings disclosures. While lower-income households are hunting for bargains as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war has forced companies to raise prices, wealthier consumers are buying steadily, largely unaffected by the cooling labor market. Stock market gains and low credit card debt have bolstered the finances of the affluent. According to Moody's Analytics, the richest 10% of Americans - those earning at least $250,000 a year - now account for half of all consumer spending.

""We've been shifting our business towards a more elevated full-price consumer base, and this has served us well as our core consumer around the world remains resilient,"" Ralph Lauren CEO Patrice Louvet said in early August. Under Armour's CEO Kevin Plank said in August the company was considering bumping up prices for the ""embedded consumer who we do have pricing power with,"" referring to loyal customers. ""We're seeing success testing new key items at full price, including our $45 Self-form hat and our heat gear collection are both strong examples.""

And if that strategy doesn't work, better consumer-tracking technology now allows retailers to pivot quickly and offer targeted promotions, helping them generate higher profit margins, said Kate McShane, managing director at Goldman Sachs.

At the forefront of this transformation is Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), which is redefining the boundaries of satellite-based infrastructure. By leveraging its expertise in 5G Direct-to-Device (D2D) technology, laser communications (SOLiS), and flexible geostationary satellites (Space Inspire), the company is not merely adapting to market needs but actively shaping the next generation of global connectivity. For investors, this strategic positioning offers compelling insights into the firm’s potential to capture emerging demand in a sector poised for exponential growth.

5G D2D: Bridging Terrestrial and Satellite Networks

The convergence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks is a critical milestone in achieving seamless global 5G coverage. Thales Alenia Space has taken a leading role in this domain through its U DESERVE 5G project, a government-backed initiative under France’s 2030 industrial strategy. This project, involving partners such as Capgemini, Orange,

, , and Loft Orbital, aims to demonstrate direct communication between satellites and mobile devices or fixed terminals. A demonstrator satellite in low-Earth orbit will test interoperability between terrestrial and satellite 5G networks, addressing a key challenge: ensuring smooth handovers between the two systems. According to a report by Thales Alenia Space, this initiative will evaluate how devices can transition between satellite and terrestrial coverage, a capability essential for applications ranging from IoT to emergency response [1].

The company’s collaboration with

and Qualcomm since 2022 has further advanced this vision. In early 2025, the trio achieved a breakthrough by demonstrating an end-to-end 5G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) call using a simulated LEO satellite channel in a French laboratory. This milestone proved that 5G-capable devices can maintain uninterrupted connectivity in remote areas—such as oceans or dense forests—without requiring additional satellite equipment [3]. By tackling technical hurdles like latency management and Doppler effects, Thales Alenia Space is accelerating the commercialization of NTN, a market projected to grow rapidly as demand for ""connectivity anywhere"" intensifies.

SOLiS: Revolutionizing Laser Communications

While 5G D2D addresses the ""last mile"" of connectivity, Thales Alenia Space is simultaneously pushing the frontiers of data transmission through its SOLiS (Service Optique de Liaisons Spatiales Sécurisées) project. Funded under the France 2030 program and led by CNES, SOLiS aims to demonstrate the viability of optical communications via geostationary satellites. This technology promises to deliver ultra-secure, high-speed data transfer—up to one terabit per second—while mitigating the vulnerabilities of traditional radio-frequency systems [1].

The project builds on prior innovations, such as the CO-OP and VERTIGO initiatives, and involves a consortium of industry leaders and startups. The optical payload will be deployed on the Hellas Sat 5 geostationary satellite, with pilot ground stations in Cyprus and Côte d’Azur. By leveraging free-space optics (FSO), SOLiS could enable multi-orbit connectivity, addressing the growing need for resilient, high-capacity networks in sectors like defense, finance, and critical infrastructure. As stated by Thales Alenia Space, this initiative underscores the company’s commitment to developing technologies that not only meet current demands but also anticipate future challenges in data security and transmission efficiency [1].

Space Inspire: Flexible Geostationary Satellites for Dynamic Markets

While LEO and MEO satellites dominate discussions on 5G and IoT, geostationary (GEO) satellites remain indispensable for high-capacity, wide-area coverage. Thales Alenia Space’s Space Inspire platform is redefining the role of GEO satellites through its all-digital, reconfigurable-in-orbit design. This innovation allows operators to dynamically adjust satellite capacity in response to market fluctuations, a critical advantage in an era of rapidly evolving demand.

In 2022, the company secured six of the ten contracts for GEO telecom satellites in the global open market, a testament to the platform’s appeal. Notable projects include the Intelsat 41 (IS-41), Intelsat 44 (IS-44), and Eutelsat Flexsat satellites, which leverage Space Inspire’s flexibility to deliver tailored services. More recently, the firm secured an order for the JSAT-31 satellite, which will provide broadband services across Asia and the Pacific [2]. By combining high throughput with adaptability, Space Inspire positions Thales Alenia Space to dominate a market segment that remains vital for global connectivity, even as LEO constellations expand.

Strategic Implications for Investors

Thales Alenia Space’s tripartite strategy—advancing 5G D2D, laser communications, and flexible GEO satellites—positions it as a linchpin in the next-gen telecom infrastructure. The company’s ability to integrate terrestrial and satellite systems, pioneer secure data transmission, and offer adaptable satellite solutions aligns with three key trends: the global push for universal connectivity, the rise of data-intensive applications, and the need for resilient infrastructure in the face of geopolitical and environmental risks.

For investors, the implications are clear. The satellite telecom market, valued at over $250 billion in 2023, is expected to grow at a compound annual rate exceeding 10% through 2030, driven by 5G expansion, IoT proliferation, and the digitization of critical sectors. Thales Alenia Space’s leadership in these areas, supported by government partnerships and commercial contracts, suggests a strong capacity to capture market share. Moreover, its focus on interoperability and reconfigurability ensures that its solutions remain relevant across diverse use cases, from consumer broadband to industrial IoT and defense communications.

Conclusion

Thales Alenia Space is not merely a participant in the satellite telecom revolution—it is a catalyst. By pioneering technologies that bridge the gap between terrestrial and space-based networks, the company is addressing the most pressing challenges in global connectivity. For investors, the firm’s strategic alignment with emerging demand, coupled with its track record of innovation and commercial success, presents a compelling case for long-term growth.

The South African government is being urged to renationalize ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) to prevent widespread job losses and revive the nation's industrial sector, according to a report. Zwelinzima Vavi, general secretary of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU), stated that the company has started closing its long-rolling mill assets, threatening approximately 3,500 direct jobs and up to 100,000 indirect positions.

Data from the IndexBox platform indicates that South Africa's steel production has faced significant headwinds, contributing to the sector's instability. Nearly two years of negotiations between the company and the government have failed to address core issues, including high raw material costs and intense competition from cheap imports.

Vavi warned that job losses are accelerating at an alarming rate, a situation compounded by the 30% tariffs imposed on South Africa by the United States, which he said threaten an additional 100,000 jobs. Negotiations for the state-owned Industrial Development Corp (IDC) to acquire ArcelorMittal's local division are reportedly at an impasse due to differences over valuation, with offers of up to 7 billion rand ($398.6 million) being discussed.

According to a statement, AMSA is exploring various strategic options while the IDC conducts a comprehensive review. Recent reports from the Solidarity trade union suggest the company plans to lay off nearly half of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, with cuts potentially extending to its flagship flat steel production facility in Vanderbijlpark.

About the ACSI The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI®) has been a national economic indicator for over 25 years.","ANN ARBOR, Mich., September 09, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Consumers are raising the bar for what they expect from their home electronics and appliances, and shiny new features will only impress them so much.

According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI®) Household Appliance and Electronics Study 2025, satisfaction remains steady across televisions and personal computers (PCs) — 82 and 81 (on a scale of 0 to 100), respectively — and up just 1% to 81 for household appliances. The vacuum cleaner industry debuts with an ACSI score of 79.

Yet, as brands race to introduce new technologies and smarter devices, the real battleground is shifting from product innovation to the overall customer experience.

""Manufacturers are discovering that the true test isn’t just in delivering the latest tech, but in providing reliable, high-quality service that meets rising consumer expectations,"" said Forrest Morgeson, Associate Professor of Marketing at Michigan State University and Director of Research Emeritus at the ACSI. ""In this competitive market, value and support matter as much, if not more, than innovation. The brands that can deliver on both fronts while listening, adapting, and evolving alongside their customers will set the pace for what comes next.""

Samsung maintains grip on television industry

Televisions remain one of the most competitive industries measured by the ACSI — just 3 points separating the highest- and lowest-scoring companies — as all companies achieve scores in the 80s.

Despite slipping 1%, Samsung still leads the way with an ACSI score of 83. The industry leader continues to be a pioneer in introducing cutting-edge technology and sets the standard in the premium higher-price categories.

Hisense and Vizio, each up 1% to 82, tie for second place. The brands are making strong plays in the U.S. market, leveraging quality retail relationships and a high value proposition. LG (down 1%) and TCL (up 3%) are next at 81 apiece — the latter making the biggest strides in the industry — while Sony brings up the rear after sliding 1% to an ACSI score of 80.

At an industrywide level, ratings of the individual customer experience benchmarks are largely consistent year over year. The highest marks go to fundamental product attributes like image quality, durability, ease of set up, and ease of using the remote. The lower marks are with the outcome of service repairs, courtesy and helpfulness of technicians, repair timeliness, and call center satisfaction.

Apple’s fall gives HP its opening in the PC industry

While overall industry satisfaction is unmoved, individual personal computer brands experience notable changes.

Apple (82) cedes the top spot to HP (down 1% to 83) after tumbling 4% year over year. The latter combines high-quality products with a strong value proposition to lead all competitors in overall satisfaction.

Dell, which is leaning into AI PCs, stands out in 2025 as the only measured brand to see customer satisfaction improvement, gaining 3% to move into a second-place tie with Apple. Samsung and Lenovo remain middle of the pack after modest 1% declines to 81 and 79, respectively. Amazon (78) and Asus (76) both suffer 3% drops, while Microsoft (76) and last-place Acer (75) decline 4% each.

The effort to harness new technology, cater to growing customer demands, and compete with other global leaders has led to high ratings across nearly all the individual characteristics measured in the survey. Computer design leads the way, followed closely behind by the availability of software or applications and graphics/sound quality. Meanwhile, call center satisfaction is the lowest-rated aspect of the PC user experience.

As for device types, 7 points separate the overall rating for desktop satisfaction (84) and tablet satisfaction (77). While laptop satisfaction is unchanged at 81, desktop user satisfaction increases 2% and tablet satisfaction falls 5%.

Samsung joins Whirlpool atop household appliances

Only 2 points separate the highest and lowest brands in the household appliance industry, which includes major kitchen and laundry appliances.

Samsung (up 1%) now shares the lead with Whirlpool (down 1%) with ACSI scores of 82. LG (down 1%) sits a point off the leaders at 81, followed by Bosch, Electrolux (up 1%), and Haier (up 1%) — which also includes the GE and Hotpoint brands — at 80 apiece. After experiencing strong U.S. sales growth in 2024, Bosch sees the largest gain in the industry, climbing 3% year over year.

In terms of appliance types, Whirlpool leads the over-the-range microwave (85) and refrigerator (84) segments outright and ties Samsung for highest dryer satisfaction (82). LG claims the top spot in washers (84) and ties Bosch atop dishwashers (82). Haier takes first in the combined range/cooktop/oven segment with a score of 83.

The reliability of mobile apps used in relation to household appliances jumps 4% to lead all other benchmarks. A series of product-based attributes follows, with high marks for capacity, durability, and design. Overall, the outcome of service repairs improves, up 4%. Similarly, the service repair timeliness (up 3%) is better. However, the lower scores for service shine a light on the opportunity companies have to distinguish themselves, whether that’s choosing the right appliance, day-to-day usage, or service and customer interactions.

Samsung sweeps away the competition among vacuum cleaners

Samsung takes the top spot in the inaugural vacuum cleaner measurement with an ACSI score of 82. Shark (81), Bissell (80), and Dyson (80) are all close behind.

iRobot’s Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner scores 78, just ahead of Dirt Devil and Eureka at 77 apiece. Electrolux and Hoover finish in last place with ACSI scores of 76.

Industrywide, ease of operation tops the list of benchmarks. The ease of emptying the canister or dust collector is also rated high, with some models now including self-cleaning features as manufacturers look for innovative ways to reduce user burden.

In general, vacuum owners have great success with the outcome of their service repair and the ease of arranging service. The timeliness of the repair is rated slightly lower, while the lowest service-based score is given to the courtesy and helpfulness of the technician.

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” Rob Montgomery, Walmart U.S. executive vice president for supply chain, said in a news release.

The Lyman-area facility is the third of five new high-tech perishable distribution centers Walmart is opening nationwide, marking what the company calls a significant milestone in its supply chain transformation. These facilities leverage advanced automation to process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution center, according to the release.

“South Carolina continues to lead in innovation and logistics, and Walmart’s investment in Spartanburg County is driving that momentum forward,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in the release. “Through advanced supply chain technology and a strong commitment to local sourcing, we’re proud to partner with Walmart to deliver fresh, affordable food to communities across our state and the region.”

Walmart says the company is reshaping work for employees by integrating technology that removes some of their most physically demanding tasks. For example, robotics now handle the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

Associates at the facility work alongside the high-tech systems that build store-specific pallets, ensuring fragile items like eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top to minimize product damage, the release stated. AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness. This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier.

The facility is home to more than 600 full-time Walmart associates with ongoing opportunities for career growth and development, the release said. Walmart is currently hiring a variety of roles, including automation equipment operators. Full-time positions qualify for Walmart’s total rewards and benefits plans, including medical, vision and dental insurance, 401(k) matching, paid time off, stock purchase plan and access to a tuition-paid college degree through Walmart’s Live Better U.

“We are thrilled to welcome Walmart to the Lyman community. Walmart’s new high-tech facility is a powerful investment in our future — creating hundreds of quality jobs and bringing lasting career opportunities across the Upstate,” Lyman Mayor Glenn Greer said in the release. “This milestone not only strengthens Lyman but also positions our region for continuing economic growth in the coming years.”

During the celebration, Walmart awarded $15,000 in grants to the following local nonprofit organizations: local food pantry, Greer Relief; STEM-focused public school, Wellford Academy of Science and Technology; area soup kitchen, Breaking Bread for Jesus; and foster care support provider, PS I Love You Ministries.

Speaking with ANI, on the side lines of ISA Steel conclave in New Delhi, Kazuo Mike Fujisawa, Representative, Japan Iron & Steel Federation told ANI, that many Japanese steel companies are showing interest in India.

""India has high steel production growth and its population is growing so it has high steel consumption per capita,"" he said.

JFE-JSW electrical steel JV progressing in Karnataka

India and Japan are old trade partners when it comes to the steel industry.""We have couple of joint ventures. JFE has major stake holding in JSW Steel...The latest joint venture between JEF and JSW was established over a year ago and expanding now. May be new ventures in near future cannot be ruled out,"" he added.

Japan's JFE Steel Corporation (JFE Steel) and JSW Steel Limited (JSW Steel) had established JSW JFE Electrical Steel Private Limited (subject to statutory approvals), a joint venture company for grain-oriented electrical steel in India and held a groundbreaking ceremony on February 12, 2024 at Bellary in Karnataka, India, where the new facility is proposed to be developed.

The joint venture was aimed to start full production in fiscal 2027, and to expand production in line with the growing market for grain-oriented electrical steel in India.

Nippon Steel-ArcelorMittal JV also expanding capacity

Similarly, Japan's Nippon Steel and India's Arcelor Mittal had a joint venture, they have plans to expand their capacity, Fujisawa said.

The ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel joint venture, known as AM/NS India, was formed in December 2019 following the acquisition of insolvent Essar Steel by the two major steel companies. It is an integrated flat steel manufacturer in India, offering a wide range of steel products for industries like automotive and infrastructure. The JV operates a large integrated steel plant in Hazira, Gujarat, and other facilities across India

However, he added, ""Doing business in India is not easy we need well established domestic players to do business here in India.

US slashes tariffs on Japanese cars to 15%

""On US tariff, Fujisawa said, Japan government has recently signed a document with US to reduce the tariff on the East Asian country. On Friday, US inked an executive order slashing import tariffs on Japanese cars from 27.5 per cent to 15 per cent.

It was a major thrust to the Japanese industry where earlier threat of 27.5 per cent tariff was lurking.

""Auto industry is big industry in Japan not for exports but also local supply chain as well,"" he said, adding that Japan exports around 1.3 million units of cars to US in a year.

The number of automobiles being shipped out from Japan to US are quite enormous.

""Japan is working hard to find middle ground. Tariff is really affecting us,"" Fujisawa said.

The current15 per cent tariff may still impact the industry to certain extent.

Major car producing companies in Japan are Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Suzuki.

For motor finance providers, the tariff rollback reduces uncertainty around vehicle pricing, residual value forecasting, and leasing volumes.

With this new investment, Anheuser-Busch aims to meet rising demand for Michelob ULTRA, which has become the top-selling beer in the Southeast and continues to gain market share nationwide.

Anheuser-Busch’s latest investment reflects both increased consumer demand for low-calorie beers like Michelob ULTRA and the company’s strategy to maintain its leadership in the American brewing industry.","Anheuser-Busch has announced a $9.2 million investment in its Cartersville, Georgia brewery to expand production capacity for Michelob ULTRA, the fastest-growing beer brand in the United States. The company made the announcement on Monday, stating that the funds will be used to upgrade brewing equipment at the facility, which has been operating since 1993.

The Cartersville brewery currently produces 48 different products that are distributed to 32 states across the country. With this new investment, Anheuser-Busch aims to meet rising demand for Michelob ULTRA, which has become the top-selling beer in the Southeast and continues to gain market share nationwide. The company cited data from Circana showing Michelob ULTRA’s leading position in sales growth as of mid-August.

This move is part of Anheuser-Busch’s broader Brewing Futures initiative, a commitment to invest more than $300 million in U.S. facilities to support manufacturing jobs and local economies. Since 2020, the company has invested over $230 million in the Cartersville brewery alone and nearly $2 billion across its 100 U.S. facilities over the past five years.

Brendan Whitworth, CEO of Anheuser-Busch, said that ongoing investments in people, breweries, and communities are essential for driving local economic growth and providing more American-made products to consumers. He emphasized that expanding production at Cartersville will help meet consumer demand while supporting jobs in Georgia.

Georgia State Representative Matthew Gambill of Cartersville welcomed the announcement, highlighting Anheuser-Busch’s role in boosting economic vitality and job creation in the region. He noted that continued investment ensures Cartersville remains a leader in industry innovation and growth.

The Cartersville brewery’s expansion comes as Michelob ULTRA strengthens its presence as a lifestyle brand associated with sports and wellness. The beer is an official sponsor of Major League Soccer, the PGA Tour, and several upcoming global sporting events including the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games in Milan and Los Angeles.

Anheuser-Busch’s latest investment reflects both increased consumer demand for low-calorie beers like Michelob ULTRA and the company’s strategy to maintain its leadership in the American brewing industry. The upgrades at Cartersville are expected to enhance production efficiency and support continued growth for one of the country’s most popular beer brands.",https://www.vinetur.com/imagenes/iconos/favicon-192x192.png,N,,2025-09-09 17:20:50.648645

Automotive supply chains could shed 13,000 jobs.
Redirecting ZAR 248 billion ($14.2 billion) in Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) funds to protect industrial jobs.","The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) has condemned ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) for shutting down its long steel operations in Newcastle and Vereeniging, while also putting the future of Vanderbijlpark at risk. The union warned that the closures will devastate workers and communities, accelerating the collapse of South Africa’s steel and manufacturing base.

Vanderbijlpark alone has lost 10,000 jobs since 1990. The latest closures will directly eliminate 4,000 jobs, with tens of thousands more threatened in downstream industries such as automotive and construction.

Subsidies failed to prevent shutdowns

Despite receiving ZAR 3.4 billion ($194.6 million) in public funds over the past 18 months, including Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) loans, wage support and special electricity tariffs, AMSA is closing plants.

IDC support: ZAR 1 billion in June 2024, ZAR 380 million ($21.74 million) in early 2025, and ZAR 1.68 billion ($96.16 million) in March 2025

Unemployment Insurance Fund/Temporary Employee Relief Scheme wage support: ZAR 417 million ($23.88 million)

Discounted tariff granted by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) despite domestic electric company Eskom’s rejection

SAFTU accused AMSA of “corporate plunder”, arguing that subsidies benefited executives and foreign shareholders instead of saving jobs. AMSA CEO Kobus Verster, reportedly earning over ZAR 20 million ($1.14 million) annually, was criticized for prioritizing profits.

National and industrial consequences

The closures threaten to erase South Africa’s last integrated carbon steel capacity, leaving the country dependent on imports and vulnerable to global market manipulation.

The Newcastle closure could put 60,000-80,000 downstream jobs at risk.

Automotive supply chains could shed 13,000 jobs.

Manufacturing’s share of gross domestic product (GDP) has already dropped from 20 percent in 1994 to 11-13 percent today, with 430,000 factory jobs lost since 2008.

Global trade pressures

South Africa also faces global steel overcapacity, dumping from China, and Trump’s 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum that redirected supply into weaker markets. SAFTU criticized the Ramaphosa government for failing to build a BRICS-wide defense strategy.

SAFTU’s demands

The federation has declared the closures a national emergency and demands:

Renationalization of AMSA under worker-state co-ownership.

Export taxes and beneficiation mandates on chrome, iron ore, and other minerals.

Strict antidumping tariffs.

A public investment-led national reindustrialization plan for steel, rail, ports, and energy.

A jobs rescue package for Newcastle, Vereeniging, and Vanderbijlpark.

Dabur, India’s third-largest oral care player, has launched a campaign positioning its toothpaste as the national alternative to Colgate-Palmolive, intensifying calls to support local goods amid worsening trade relations between the United States and India.

THE DETAILS The US$11 billion Indian consumer goods company ran a front-page advertisement in the Times of India, using unbranded packaging resembling Colgate’s to highlight that India’s best-selling toothpaste is American-owned. The copy, styled in red, white, and blue font, declared “Born there, not here” and urged consumers to choose “Swadeshi” — or made-in-India — products. Colgate currently controls 43% of India’s toothpaste market, ahead of Unilever’s Pepsodent at 23%, with Dabur holding 17%, according to Euromonitor. The campaign coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s renewed calls for citizens to favour local goods after the U.S. imposed tariffs of up to 50% on Indian imports. Dabur’s ad included a QR code directing shoppers to Amazon India, while other domestic companies — including dairy brand Amul and email provider Rediff — have also leaned into nationalist messaging in their promotions.

THE WHY? Advertising around consumer goods has become entangled with geopolitics, as Indian companies seek to capitalise on heightened nationalist sentiment amid trade frictions with the United States.

Last year, Western Digital touted its partnership with Chinese surveillance company Uniview at a policing trade expo, months before Uniview was sanctioned over complicity in rights abuses.","BEIJING (AP) — American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warningsfrom the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.

The AP investigation was based on tens of thousands of leaked emails and databases from a Chinese surveillance company; thousands of pages of confidential corporate and government documents; public Chinese language marketing material; and thousands of procurements, many provided by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the non-profit Asia Society. The AP also drew from dozens of open record requests and interviews with more than 100 current and former Chinese and American engineers, executives, experts, officials, administrators, and police officers.

American tech firms were by far the biggest suppliers, but German, Japanese, and Korean firms also had a role. Here are some examples:

MILITARY ACCESS: A Chinese military contractor worked with Armonk, New York-based IBM in 2009 to design national intelligence systems, including a counterterrorism system, according to classified Chinese government documents. These systems were used by China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security, and the Chinese military. IBM referred to any such deals as “old, stale interactions”: “ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.”

ANTI-TERROR ANALYSIS: IBM agents in China sold IBM’s i2 policing analysis software to the Xinjiang police, China’s Ministry of State Security, and other Chinese police units throughout the 2010s, leaked emails show. i2 software was subsequently copied and deployed by one former IBM agent, Landasoft, as the basis for a predictive policing platform that tagged hundreds of thousands of people as potential terrorists during a brutal crackdown in China’s far west Xinjiang region. IBM says it ceased relations with Landasoft in 2014, prohibited sales to police in Xinjiang and Tibet since 2015, and has no record of any sales of i2 software to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.

ETHNIC REPRESSION: Dell and then-subsidiary VMWare sold cloud software and storage devices to police and entities providing data to police in Tibet and Xinjiang, even as late as 2022 after ethnic repression there was widely known. Dell addressed race in its marketing: In 2019, Dell said on WeChat it had teamed up with surveillance firm Yitu to sell a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop for Chinese police with “all-race recognition.” Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, told AP it conducts “rigorous due diligence” to ensure compliance with U.S. export controls. Chinese policing systems, including in Xinjiang, also used software from Oracle, based in Austin, Texas, and from Microsoft, based in Seattle, according to procurements and a leaked database obtained by AP.

FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION: Chinese defense contractor Huadi worked with IBM to construct China’s national fingerprint database; IBM said it never sold “fingerprinting-specific” products to the Chinese government and that any possible misuse “for fingerprinting purposes” was done without its knowledge or assistance. HP and VMWare sold technology used for fingerprint comparison by Chinese police. Intel said in 2019 marketing material that it partnered with Hisign, a Chinese fingerprinting company that sold to Xinjiang police, to make their fingerprint readers more effective, and that the new reader was “fully tested in an actual application scenario” with a municipal police bureau. Hisign was still an Intel partner as of last year, according to Chinese media reports. California-based Intel said it has not had any technical engagement with Hisign since 2024, and told AP it would “act swiftly” if it became aware of any “credible misuse.”

AI CAMERAS: IBM, Dell, Tokyo-based Hitachi, and VMWare promoted facial recognition for use by Chinese police. Japanese electronics giant Sony said on its official WeChat account that it wired a Chinese prison with “intelligent” cameras, saying it was widely trusted for “surveillance projects.” California chip giant NVIDIA and Intel partnered with China’s three biggest surveillance companies to add AI capabilities to camera systems used for video surveillance across China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet, until sanctions were imposed. Relations with other Chinese surveillance companies continued more recently: NVIDIA posted on its WeChat social media account in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk. NVIDIA told AP those relationships no longer continue.

SURVEILLANCE RESEARCH: NVIDIA, IBM, and Hitachi staff collaborated with Chinese police researchers and companies on surveillance technology. NVIDIA said in a post dating to 2013 or later that a Chinese police institute used its chips for surveillance technology research. NVIDIA said it doesn’t currently work with Chinese police but did not address the past. And in 2021, an IBM and a U.S. Army researcher coauthored an AI video study with a Chinese police researcher working at a sanctioned company, according to a paper unearthed by IPVM, a surveillance research publication. The U.S. Army told AP the Chinese police researcher only worked on the paper after the Army researcher’s work had concluded.

DNA: Chinese police DNA labs bought Dell and Microsoft software and equipment to save genetic data on police databases. In 2021, Hitachi advertised DNA sequencers to Chinese police, and police labs bought pipettes from German biotech firm Eppendorf last year. And until contacted by AP in August, Massachusetts-based biotech firm Thermo Fisher Scientific‘s website stated that its kits are made for China’s national DNA database and “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans,” and featured the work of a Chinese police researcher who discussed using Thermo Fisher kits to identify ethnic Uyghur and Manchu populations at a 2016 conference. Thermo Fisher stopped sales in Xinjiang in 2021 and in Tibet in 2024, but still promotes kits to police elsewhere in China, including at a police trade show earlier this year. In a statement to AP, Thermo Fisher said its kits “are designed to be effective across diverse global populations” but “do not have the capability to distinguish among specific ethnic groups.”

INTERNET POLICE: In 2014, VMWare said internet police in cities across China used its software, and in 2016, Dell said on its WeChat account that its services assisted the Chinese internet police in “cracking down on rumormongers” — essentially promoting censorship. An undated IBM marketing presentation said that internet police in Shanghai and Guangzhou used its i2 software, with metadata suggesting it was from 2018. IBM held a conference in Beijing promoting i2 in 2018, according to its official WeChat account.

ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY: Leaked government blueprints show Illinois-based Motorola provided encrypted radio communications technology to the Chinese police for handling “sudden and mass events in Beijing.” Motorola did not respond to requests for comment.

AI DRIVES: Californian hard disk giants Seagate and Western Digital and Tokyo-based Toshiba sell hard drives specialized for AI video systems for use by Chinese police. In 2022, Toshiba wrote about how its surveillance hard drives can help police monitor communities to “identify and control suspicious” or “blacklisted” individuals. “They’re optimized and adapted for security systems,” Toshiba sales director Feng Hao told AP. Last year, Western Digital touted its partnership with Chinese surveillance company Uniview at a policing trade expo, months before Uniview was sanctioned over complicity in rights abuses. And Seagate said on WeChat in 2022 that it sells hard drives “tailor made” for AI video systems in China for use by police to help them ”control key persons,” and promoted their drives to police at a security trade association in China this year.

MAPPING SOFTWARE: Blueprints show that in 2009, IBM, Oracle, and Esri, the creator of ArcGIS based in California, sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of software to build China’s Police Geographic Information System, and in 2013, HP said it sold “digital fencing” solutions to Chinese police. Such systems alert Chinese police even today when Uyghurs, Tibetans or dissidents stray out of provinces, counties or even villages. The U.S. curbed exports of such mapping software to China in 2020. But the restrictions are narrow in scope, and Esri maintains a research center in Beijing that marketed to police and other Chinese clients. Esri denied involvement.

POLICE GEAR: Chinese police patrol the streets equipped with foreign technology. Officers stroll the streets of Beijing with Motorola walkie-talkies, for example, while Korean electronics giant Samsung sells microSD cards for police body cameras, advertising them at Chinese police trade shows in 2023 and 2024. And in WeChat posts, Chinese state-owned company Jinghua said it cooperated with German electronics giant Philips on China’s first ”AI-powered 5G” police body camera and advertised Philips-branded recorders and cameras to Chinese police. In a statement, Philips said it had no partnership with Jinghua, did not authorize sales of Philips-branded body cameras in China, and would be contacting Jinghua over the posts.

IBM, Dell, California network seller Cisco, Seattle-based Amazon Web Services, Seagate, Intel, Thermo Fisher and Western Digital all said they adhere to relevant export controls, laws and regulations where they operate. Eppendorf, Sony, and Hitachi declined to describe their business relationships in China but said they respected human rights.

Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and California tech conglomerate Broadcom, which acquired VMWare in 2023, did not comment on the record. HP, Motorola, Samsung, Toshiba, Huadi, and Landasoft did not respond. Microsoft said it did not knowingly provide software for updates to China’s main policing system.

The Xinjiang government said in a statement that it uses surveillance technologies to “prevent and combat terrorist and criminal activity” and does not target any particular ethnicity. The statement said Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.” Other government agencies did not respond to a request for comment.

The new Marketplace store that will house the deli will occupy a site that was formerly home to a K-Mart store and is about 10 miles from Kroger’s headquarters in Cincinnati. Kroger said it invested $25 million to develop the new location, which is set to open on Sept. 19. The store will span about 101,000 square feet, according to a report in The Cincinnati Enquirer.

A Freedom of Information request lodged by the Daily Express showed that tax office staff took 551,064 sick days between August 2024 and July 2025.
This was down slightly from 565,244 the previous year, but an increase on the 540,052 sick days taken between August 2022 and July 2023.
“This is unfair on taxpayers and damaging to productivity.” There are 65,000 staff working for the tax office meaning each employee takes an average of eight sick days per year.

A total of 1.6 million working days were lost in that time thanks to staff absences at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) – something the Conservatives said was “unfair on taxpayers”.

It comes after a HMRC boss admitted four million calls from taxpayers were going unanswered every year.

A Freedom of Information request lodged by the Daily Express showed that tax office staff took 551,064 sick days between August 2024 and July 2025.

This was down slightly from 565,244 the previous year, but an increase on the 540,052 sick days taken between August 2022 and July 2023.

Helen Whately, shadow work and pensions secretary, told the Daily Express: “These statistics are shocking – far too many days are being lost to sick leave.

“This is unfair on taxpayers and damaging to productivity.”

There are 65,000 staff working for the tax office meaning each employee takes an average of eight sick days per year.

Across the entire Civil Service, more than four million working days are being lost to sick leave, with absence rates rocketing by more than 10pc in some areas.

Ms Whately added: “People should only be signed off if they are genuinely too ill to work. Too many sick notes are handed out without proper care or consideration for what’s best for patients, employers and taxpayers.”

Last week, Jonathan Athow, HMRC boss, was forced to admit as many as four million taxpayer calls were going unanswered during a parliamentary grilling from Liam Byrne, the Labour MP.

Mr Byrne pointed out £46.8bn of tax is owed but not collected by HMRC, and asked how many calls go unanswered.

Mr Athow replied: “Off the top of my head, we’re talking three, maybe three or four million calls potentially.”

Elliot Keck, of lobby group the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told The Telegraph: “HMRC isn’t the only department with a lethargic attitude to work, sick note culture is rife amongst the Civil Service.

“Millions of days are being lost, costing taxpayers a fortune and sapping productivity at a time when Britain can least afford it. Civil service chiefs need to get a grip and ensure staff deliver value for money, rather than treating time off as an extension of their holiday entitlement.”

Seb Maley, of tax insurance provider Qdos, said: “The complexity of the UK’s tax system makes clear, reliable advice indispensable. Without effective communication channels, many taxpayers are left to navigate unclear rules on their own.”

Earlier this year, The Telegraph reported that civil servants are taking more long-term sick days than they did during the Covid crisis.

Civil servants missed 3.5 days as a result of long-term sickness on average in the year to March 2023, up from 2.8 days in 2021, according to analysis of official data by the Financial Times.

Britain’s worklessness crisis has spiralled since the pandemic, and NHS England data shows that 11 million sick notes were issued in 2022-23.

An HMRC spokesman said: “Our sickness rates are in line with the UK workforce average. We successfully handle millions of customer queries every month, mostly online, and the Government is investing £500m in our digital services so more people can sort their tax affairs without having to wait on the phone.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2025/09/09/TELEMMGLPICT000435674910_17574129824110_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-09-09 09:12:26.614907

And according to cyberdefence experts, it's reasonable to expect that airlines will continue to be targets of hackers, both the cybercriminal and state-sponsored varieties.
The Aeroflot attack was political in nature, though not perpetrated by a state actor.
Airlines also often rely on third-party providers for IT systems, a weakness that was exploited by hackers this summer.
As far as attacks by state espionage services, McGladrey said airlines aren't the only target within the travel industry.","Qantas. Hawaiian. WestJet. Air France-KLM. Aeroflot. Each of these airlines has fallen victim to cyberattacks this summer.

And according to cyberdefence experts, it's reasonable to expect that airlines will continue to be targets of hackers, both the cybercriminal and state-sponsored varieties.

""If I were a hacker, that's what I would do,"" said Recep Ozdag, a vice president in the cybersecurity division of Los Angeles-based Keysight Technologies.

""You've found an industry that is not well-protected. It's critical infrastructure with a lot of sensitive information. Why would I not go after that industry? It's low-hanging fruit.

WestJet was the first of the large airlines to report a breach this summer. Hackers were able to obtain travel-related documents, such as passports, but not payment information.

Hawaiian was struck next, on 26 June. The airline didn't offer details on which of its IT systems were compromised, but the incident almost surely played a part in the FBI issuing a warning the following day that a notorious cybercriminal organization called Scattered Spider had turned its attention to the airline industry.

Next came a 30 June attack on Qantas, in which hackers gained access to a customer-servicing platform with the names, email addresses, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers of 6 million customers.

Hackers gained access to similar data from an early August attack on Air France-KLM.

The attack on Russia's Aeroflot in late July stands out among the summer onslaught both for its motive and impact. Two pro-Ukrainian hacking groups, Silent Crow and Belarusian Cyberpartisans, claimed credit for the attack, which unlike the others, impacted operations, forcing Aeroflot to cancel more than 100 flights. The hackers claimed the attack was the culmination of a year's work in which they had destroyed 7,000 Aeroflot servers and obtained control over airline employee computers.

The Aeroflot attack was political in nature, though not perpetrated by a state actor. But cybersecurity veteran Kayne McGladrey, a senior member of IEEE, the world's largest professional society of technologists, said airlines are also under continuous attack by nation states conducting espionage. Carriers, he said, have contracts to transport government workers whose data and itineraries are of interest to foreign spy agencies.

""Statecraft is a feature of the landscape. It's day-to-day normalcy,"" McGladrey said. ""There are folks in government offices who do this for their job.""

Even if an airline, perhaps jolted by this summer's events, decides to diligently invest the required resources to harden its systems, the process will take time, Ozdag said.

Large airlines typically rely on a wide mix of operating systems, including legacy technology that is decades old and not easily updated. Plus, their IT systems are sprawling. For example, in the chaos at Delta last year following a failed software update by cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, the airline had to physically reset 40,000 servers.

""I think there is still an opening,"" Ozdag said about airline vulnerability, even if they are improving their defences. ""Is it six months? Is it a year? That depends on the airline. But if I'm a hacker, I've come to that conclusion.""

Airlines also often rely on third-party providers for IT systems, a weakness that was exploited by hackers this summer. Qantas and Air France-KLM each reported that their customer data breaches came through third-party systems.

In its notice in late June, the FBI said Scattered Spider often uses phishing attacks – impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access to internal systems. Ozdag, who works directly with aviation-aligned systems to help simulate real-world attack scenarios, said approximately 80% of successful hacks and system takeovers use similar types of social engineering attacks. The other 20% involve more direct methods, such as physical takeovers of IP systems and remote attacks on WiFi networks.

He said one reason airlines aren't as well protected as they could be is that they don't have the strong cybersecurity regulatory requirements that the financial services and healthcare sectors do. Still, he said, carriers should spend more on cyber audits, testing and security updates.

As far as attacks by state espionage services, McGladrey said airlines aren't the only target within the travel industry. An attack on the reservation system of Marriott's Starwood brands in 2018, which exposed nearly 500 million customer records, is believed to have been perpetrated by China.

Generally, espionage attacks aren't geared toward credit card fraud and personal account takeovers the way criminal cyberattacks can be, McGladrey said, but there's always a chance a government hacker will moonlight on the dark web.

While there's not much travellers can do to protect their data that is held by airlines, one step he suggests is putting a freeze on credit reports, which can prevent the unauthorised setup of new accounts.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/MC-Asia/uploadedImages/Articles/News/Association_Meetings/why-airlines-are-targeted-for-cyberattacks.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-09-09 08:06:28.534825

Likely Trend of CAH Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, shares of the company closed flat at $149.6 on Friday. In the year-to-date period, CAH’s shares have gained 26.5% compared with the industry’s 2.4% growth. The S&P 500 has increased 10.8% in the same time frame.

Cardinal Health's new distribution center in Fort Worth, TX, can boost its stock price in the long run by improving efficiency and reducing delivery times, thereby helping CAH to meet growing demand in the healthcare sector.

More on CAH’s New Distribution Center in Texas

Cardinal Health’s Fort Worth-based distribution center is 340,000 square feet in size and will support its at-home Solutions business. The facility is dedicated to shipping medical supplies directly to patients’ homes, serving more than 6 million people annually. It is expected to handle around 10,000 packages per day, covering critical needs such as diabetes, sleep apnea, and urological care. This move further strengthens the company’s role in home-based healthcare delivery.

The Texas site is the third distribution center built from the ground up in just three years for at-Home Solutions. Similar to the recently added facilities in Ohio and South Carolina, it is equipped with robotics and automation technology. These investments reflect Cardinal Health’s focus on supply chain excellence, with an emphasis on faster delivery, improved safety, and higher service levels. The expansion demonstrates the company’s commitment to meeting rising demand in the home healthcare market.

CAH’s at-Home Solutions business is delivering strong results from its recent investments in distribution capacity and automation. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew nearly 50%, with double-digit gains on an organic basis. Notably, this growth significantly outpaced the increase in freight and warehousing costs, highlighting the efficiency and scalability of the business model.

CAH’s Notable Distribution Network

Cardinal Health is continuing to strengthen its U.S. distribution network with new investments in facilities and automation. Most recently, the company announced plans to break ground on a new distribution center in Sacramento, CA, entirely dedicated to its at-Home Solutions business. The site is expected to be operational by Summer 2027 and will expand Cardinal Health’s reach on the West Coast, improving delivery speed and efficiency for patients. In addition, the company is retrofitting its existing Ontario, CA, facility with advanced automation technologies, including a fully automated outbound conveyor system.

In September 2024, the company launched a new distribution center in Greenville, SC, and partnered with Australia-based Telix to distribute Zircaix, a PET imaging agent for kidney cancer, pending regulatory approval. In August 2024, CAH unveiled plans for a state-of-the-art distribution center in Walton Hills, OH, to support its medical products and distribution segment. Prior to that, in 2023, Cardinal Health opened two distribution centers in Central Ohio and a medical products replenishment center in New York, further reinforcing its inventory capacity and supply chain resilience.

(PSO) is positioning itself at the epicenter of this transformation through its landmark partnership with . By securing the exclusive global rights to administer Salesforce certification exams, has not only solidified its dominance in the skills assessment space but also tapped into a high-growth sector poised to accelerate with the rise of AI and digital transformation. For investors, this collaboration represents a strategic masterstroke that could redefine Pearson’s revenue trajectory and market relevance.

A Market in Motion: Why Certifications Matter

The global professional certification market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.08%, . This surge is driven by the urgent demand for upskilling in AI, cloud computing, and CRM technologies—sectors where Salesforce is a dominant force. Pearson’s 2025 Value of IT Certification Candidate Report underscores this trend, , . .

Pearson’s Strategic Gambit: Capturing the Full Certification Funnel

Pearson’s partnership with Salesforce is more than a transactional agreement; it’s a calculated move to dominate the end-to-end certification lifecycle. . The integration of Pearson VUE’s OnVUE online proctoring, , and event-based testing options ensures accessibility, a critical factor in a post-pandemic world where flexibility is king.

This partnership also aligns with Pearson’s broader enterprise learning strategy. , signaling confidence in its ability to monetize its testing infrastructure [5]. By capturing the full certification pathway for Salesforce professionals, Pearson gains access to a captive audience for its learning products, from prep courses to corporate training programs. As one analyst noted, “This isn’t just about exams—it’s about building a around Salesforce’s ecosystem” [6].

Quantifying the Opportunity: Market Expansion and Revenue Leverage

While specific financial terms of the Pearson-Salesforce deal remain undisclosed, the broader market dynamics suggest substantial upside. , , . , .

Risks and Realities: Is This a Sustainable Edge?

No partnership is without risks. Competitors like

Additionally, the lack of disclosed financial terms leaves some uncertainty about Pearson’s revenue share. However, Pearson’s first-mover advantage in securing exclusivity with Salesforce—a company that raised its 2025 revenue guidance by $1 billion post-partnership—suggests a high degree of confidence in the deal’s value.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Investors

Pearson’s alliance with Salesforce is a textbook example of strategic alignment. It leverages Salesforce’s market leadership in CRM and AI with Pearson’s global testing infrastructure to create a virtuous cycle of certification demand, data insights, and monetization. For investors, this partnership isn’t just a short-term boost—it’s a long-term play on the skills economy.

Ralph Lauren today is not the same company as it was when it started, or else we would just be a tie.”","Just how stylish is the ghost in the machine? Fashion might be just about to find out.

When Ralph Lauren took to the web 25 years ago, it was one of the first designer brands to make a big push online, looking to carve out its own bit of digital Americana early.

That launch included Ask Ralph, featuring 100 commonly asked fashion questions answered by the designer himself and his team.

Now there’s a new high-tech member of that team ready to weigh in on just what fashion is as Ask Ralph relaunches Tuesday as an artificially intelligent shopping experience on the brand’s app.

“The most difficult thing for any company is to find the right technology to help you tell your story,” said David Lauren, the company’s chief branding and innovation officer, in an interview.

“Over 25 years we’ve explored a lot of different technologies. Some of them have been totally groundbreaking and have helped to change our industry and some of them disappear,” he said. “This feels like a very obvious opportunity. Not just because everybody’s talking about it, but because it has an ability to learn with us.”

There’s plenty to learn in the world of Ralph Lauren and already the AI, which has been under development for a year, has absorbed a lot, from the designer’s personal take on style to how that philosophy has been absorbed by his team and how it all has translated into the brand’s DNA.

“[AI] has the ability to sort of absorb our incredible archive as well as the words,” Lauren said. “We use the pictures and our philosophy and put it all together and make sense of it.”

Powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, the chat-based service uses natural language processing to serve up shoppable visual laydowns of complete outfits.

So a query on just what to wear to a wedding in Miami in December will pull up a carousel of options that can be added to one’s cart and bought immediately.

In a preview test at the brand’s Prince Street store in Manhattan’s SoHo shopping district, the service seemed, like Ralph Lauren in general, very buttoned up. The experience felt commercially oriented, offering up looks that can be bought at the moment and avoiding questions that might send it off course.

Asked how to dress in the style of Tommy Hilfiger or if President Donald Trump wore Polo, the technology demurred.

AI’s launch into the world has led to any number of slip-ups and embarrassing hallucinations, but Ask Ralph does not seem primed to make any big fashion faux pas.

“We’re not here to try to be clever with it,” Lauren said. “Our aim was to pull from a live inventory of what’s on the site right now. There is a whole section that pulls from the archive and the history and gives you the philosophy, but the piece that I think is going to be most valuable to customers is sort of what’s really shoppable.”

This is the first time the brand has had a consumer-facing AI tool. Lauren said the future was still wide open and that Ask Ralph could eventually become voice-activated, integrate the Collection business or be added to other platforms.

“It’s going to become more and more valuable quickly,” Lauren said. “We know that everybody’s talking about artificial intelligence, but we wanted to explore it, use it, and learn. We’re confident that this is going to be a valuable tool, but we also recognize that what it is right now is the very beginning.”

Generative AI is almost universally seen as a business and cultural game changer — potentially on the order of the iPhone or the internet itself — but there is still little consensus on just what the mid-term impact will be, other than big.

McKinsey & Co. estimated that generative AI will add $150 billion to $275 billion to fashion’s operating profits by 2030.

That would include supply chain and other back office efficiencies, changes to the workforce and new ways to connect with consumers, like the Ask Ralph feature.

Just what AI means to the future of fashion might be the big question in the industry, but it’s too big a question to answer right from the start, so Ralph Lauren is just leaning in for now.

“Everybody walks in and they want, ‘How big can it be? How fast can it grow?’” Lauren said. “That’s not really how we’re doing this. For us, this is very incremental. We have key learnings we’re trying to measure for every week.

“What we know is that we have the tool that’s going to help us get to the place we want to get to, and that over the next year it’s going to become so much smarter that by the end of this year you’ll be saying ‘Ralph Lauren led again.'”

Lauren is reaching for the stars, but not promising the moon.

“Perfectionism is important in fashion, but it can also stop you from taking risks and moving forward,” Lauren said. “I think we know that there’s a good marriage here, but it’s going to have to grow together to get stronger and better.

“Everybody’s racing. Don’t. Just stop racing. Set your own pace, understand who you are and move carefully to understand how your brand is best married to technology. And don’t rush to keep up with: ‘I have to change, I have to evolve. It has to be the hottest new thing.’ That’s what’s killed a lot of fashion.

“What makes good brands work is that they understand who they are and they know how to evolve carefully with the right pace that’s right for their brand,” Lauren said. “We’ve done that over 60 years. Ralph Lauren today is not the same company as it was when it started, or else we would just be a tie.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ask-Ralph.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-09-09 10:07:50.316636

The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Labour and Employment, had convened the emergency meeting in a bid to end the planned industrial action on Monday in Abuja.

The meeting aimed to address allegations of anti-union practices against the Dangote Refinery, but discussions reportedly broke down as the Dangote representatives’ walkout of the meeting.

The Minister of Labour and Employment, Alhaji Muhammad Dingyadi, who presided over the meeting, told newsmen that progress was slow. “We have not been able to reach final agreement on this matter. Negotiations will continue.

“Maybe by tomorrow, we will resolve the issues. I appeal to everyone to maintain peace as discussions continue,” he said. The minister, therefore assured all, that the government is still committed to finding common ground for all parties.

Speaking, Mr Benson Upah, Acting General Secretary of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), alleged that the Dangote’s delegation was deliberately sabotaging the process.

“The representative of the Dangote Refinery walked out on the Honourable Minister and Organised Labour. So, there was no agreement.

“Even, when we bent backwards to accommodate his uncompromising behaviour, he still did what he did.

“So, we are left with no choice than to do the needful. The action continues,” Upah said. He added that the labour movement remained open to dialogue, but, could not negotiate alone.

“It takes more than one party to reach a resolution.

“Whenever the Dangote Refinery sees the need for genuine dialogue, we are ready, even this night, if they return,” he said.

NUPENG President, Mr Williams Akporeha, accused Dangote Refinery of seeking to suppress workers’ rights, while expanding its monopoly in Nigeria’s energy sector.

According to him, NUPENG’s action on the matter is for the interest of Nigerians. “We cannot stand an investor whose main purpose is to enslave Nigerians.

“Dangote cannot take us back to the dark days of slavery.”he added. He further accused the refinery of denying employees the right to unionise.

The Country Head of Zoho Nigeria, Mr Kehinde Ogundare, disclosed this during Zoho’s 2025 User Conference, Zoholics Nigeria, held in Lagos on Monday.

He said a study conducted by Arion Research for Zoho showed that over half of Nigerian firms had moved from experimenting with AI to applying it organisation-wide. He noted the report also found 94 per cent of companies now had a privacy officer or team, while 40 per cent allocate major IT budgets to privacy.

Ogundare said the findings proved Nigerian businesses were adopting AI responsibly, with privacy now a central part of their strategy. “This reflects Zoho’s philosophy of building privacy-first AI tools that help businesses grow while protecting customer trust,” he said.

He added that 65 per cent of organisations reported increased awareness of regulations since the introduction of Nigeria’s Data Protection Act. “Many firms now conduct privacy audits of AI systems (57 per cent), apply data minimisation (57 per cent), and demand explainability of AI decisions (52 per cent),” he said.

According to him, 69 per cent of businesses invest in data analysis skills, 53 per cent in AI literacy, and 40 per cent in prompt engineering for generative AI. He, however, noted that lack of technical expertise remained a barrier for 37 per cent of firms, though many were responding through upskilling.

Alongside the report, Ogundare revealed that Zoho achieved 75 per cent customer growth in Nigeria in 2024, making it one of its strongest African markets.

In 2024, 1.36 billion de minimis shipments entered the U.S., according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
But the ramifications are big for all retailers heading into the holiday shopping season.
This year, Drabicky said clients are asking for three to four holiday ad plans that can be quickly adjusted.
PMG’s Shea agreed that the change could potentially result in global shipping delays when consumers are shopping for holiday gifts.","Retailers are bracing for another challenge during the critical holiday season: import fees.

The recent ending of the so-called de minimis rule closes a longtime trade exemption that allowed companies to skip paying import fees on packages entering the U.S. if the packages are worth less than $800. The exception was supposed to end in July 2027 but was pushed up by President Trump with an executive order on August. 29. Since the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began enforcing the executive order, postal deliveries to the U.S. have dropped 80%, according to the Universal Postal Union.

In 2024, 1.36 billion de minimis shipments entered the U.S., according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Experts said that the de minimis rule was largely used as a loophole for Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein to get products into the U.S. But the ramifications are big for all retailers heading into the holiday shopping season. Retailers are already facing significant challenges with uncertain tariffs and drops in consumer spending.

“Retailers are getting beat up left and right, and de minimis is another hit that retailers have to take this year,” said Vic Drabicky, founder and CEO of agency January Digital. “It forces brands to not think as long-term as they want—they have to be more reactionary and more conservative with big bets on products and advertising.”

Ad budgets in limbo

Drabicky said that the ending of de minimis—as well as the broader retail environment—means that holiday ad budgets are not set in stone. He compared this year’s budgets to 2020, when brands planned their ad budgets week to week instead of yearly.

This year, Drabicky said clients are asking for three to four holiday ad plans that can be quickly adjusted.

“Most brands haven’t cut their spend, but they also haven’t fully released it yet,” he said.

Mark Power, founder of ecommerce agency Podean, anticipated that Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein would need to pull back on their own ad spend to offset import fees and the availability of products. Temu has already pulled back significantly on its U.S.-based ad spend.

In July, Amazon briefly cut its spending on Google Shopping ads, opening up more inventory for other retailers to buy. Amazon has since come back to Google Shopping, showing how quickly retailers are changing strategies, said Simon Poulton, evp of innovation and growth at agency Tinuiti.

“On the fringes, there are probably some areas where there’s a lot of opportunity, but in general, it isn’t going to be the boom that you might expect or hope it to be,” added John Shea, head of commerce at PMG.

Higher prices are headed to consumers

The ending of de minimis means that China-based retailers will need to raise their prices to offset higher import prices. The move may offset consumers from shopping, said Podean’s Power.

“We’ll likely see Temu, Shein, and even TikTok Shop be less compelling for consumers in certain areas, given prices will have to increase as a result and [face a] possible disruption in availability,” he said.

The end of de minimis is likely to cause delays and backlogs at ports that could impact all brands, regardless of whether they previously used de minimis, Power added.

PMG’s Shea agreed that the change could potentially result in global shipping delays when consumers are shopping for holiday gifts.

“It’s going to change shipping patterns pretty dramatically,” Shea said.

Retailers are bracing for a tough holiday season

The loss of de minimis will likely help curb counterfeit products, which will help high-quality brands weed out their products. But the exemption will also affect categories like electronics that heavily rely on being imported, said January Digital’s Drabicky.

It will also change how retailers buy products with a bigger emphasis on bulk buying instead of buying from independent sellers, he said.

While de minimis is only focused on import fees, the disruption around it also extends to other issues like tariffs that retailers are managing, Tinuiti’s Poulton said.

HOBOKEN, N.J., Sept. 9, 2025 /CNW/ -- Pearson (FTS: PSON.L) and its Pearson VUE business, the global leader in computer-based testing solutions, today announced an exclusive multi-year collaboration with Salesforce, the world's #1 AI CRM, to be the sole provider of Salesforce certification exams worldwide.

As advanced technologies and AI reshape how businesses operate, professionals and organizations are racing to keep skills sharp and relevant. Together, Pearson and Salesforce are meeting this demand, integrating Pearson VUE's trusted testing systems into the Salesforce certification program, equipping employees and employers with the most current, verified Salesforce skills to drive greater value for their businesses and customers.

Key partnership benefits include a new streamlined certification pathway, vast exam catalog, and flexible delivery options. Registration for Salesforce certification exams opened on July 21, 2025.

Dr. Gary Gates, managing director, Pearson VUE says, ""Our strategic collaboration with Salesforce underscores a shared commitment to innovation and professional growth. Our new seamless certification experience is an investment in the future of professionals around the world, providing opportunities for individual career advancement and organizational success.""

According to Pearson's 2025 Value of IT Certification Candidate Report, over 70% of certified professionals report increased efficiency, innovation, and enhanced productivity as a result of gaining a certification. Sixty-three percent received or anticipated a promotion within the context of earning a certification.

For Salesforce, certifications help ensure that professionals using Salesforce keep pace with the platform's evolution and make the most of its powerful capabilities.

""Salesforce has become essential as companies embrace digital transformation, integrating advanced AI capabilities into their workflows to unlock new levels of efficiency across sales, marketing, and service teams. As enterprises look for ways to outpace competitors and adapt to changing market demands, harnessing Salesforce's CRM and AI features is key to achieving lasting success and operational excellence. Salesforce certifications unlock this potential, empowering professionals to enhance their skills, demonstrate expertise and lead their organizations in achieving operational excellence and lasting growth,"" says Sanjeev Balakrishnan, EVP of Customer Success at Salesforce.

A Unified Certification Journey

Pearson and Salesforce have connected their systems to create a single, streamlined journey for certification candidates. From registration to exam day, everything is in one place - clear, efficient, and built around the candidate.

Extensive Salesforce Exam Catalog

Pearson VUE will oversee a diverse catalog of 80 Salesforce certification exams, including:

Salesforce Administrator: A foundational certification validating skills in customizing Salesforce and managing users and data.

Innovative Exam Delivery Options

Pearson VUE will offer Salesforce certification exams in three flexible formats, designed to meet professionals whether they are online, in person, or on-site at client events:

Walmart associates, elected officials, and community leaders celebrated the grand opening of a new 725,000 square-foot perishable distribution center (PDC). The state-of-the-art facility is designed to receive and process fresh produce, eggs, dairy, meat and frozen goods for delivery to 180 Walmart stores.

Freshness Delivered Faster

“The opening of our new high-tech perishable distribution center marks a major step forward in how we get fresher products to customers faster — whether that’s in-store, delivered to their home, or even restocking their refrigerator,” said Rob Montgomery, executive vice president, Supply Chain, Walmart U.S., in a recent release.

The Lyman area facility is the third of five new high-tech PDCs Walmart is opening nationwide, marking a significant milestone in the company’s supply chain transformation. These facilities leverage advanced automation to process more than double the volume of a traditional distribution center.

“South Carolina continues to lead in innovation and logistics, and Walmart’s investment in Spartanburg County is driving that momentum forward,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. “Through advanced supply chain technology and a strong commitment to local sourcing, we’re proud to partner with Walmart to deliver fresh, affordable food to communities across our state and the region.”

Technology That Transforms Work

Walmart is reshaping associates’ work by integrating technology that removes some of their most physically demanding tasks. For example, robotics now handles the movement of cases on and off pallets, reducing the need for strenuous lifting.

Associates at the facility work alongside the high-tech systems that build store-specific pallets, ensuring fragile items like eggs and yogurt are placed toward the top to minimize product damage. AI tracks every pallet to ensure accuracy and freshness. This technology also makes unloading at stores faster and easier, allowing store associates to spend more time helping customers.

The facility is home to more than 600 full-time Walmart associates with ongoing opportunities for career growth and development. Walmart is currently hiring a variety of roles, including automation equipment operators. Full-time positions qualify for Walmart’s total rewards and benefits plans, including medical, vision, and dental insurance, 401(k) matching, paid time off, stock purchase plan, and access to a tuition-paid college degree through Walmart’s Live Better U.

“We are thrilled to welcome Walmart to the Lyman community. Walmart’s new high-tech facility is a powerful investment in our future – creating hundreds of quality jobs and bringing lasting career opportunities across the Upstate,” said Lyman Mayor Glenn Greer. “This milestone not only strengthens Lyman but also positions our region for continuing economic growth in the coming years.”

The move, which brings together CXOs of global corporations, industry bodies like NASSCOM, business councils, consulting leaders, real estate developers, and top academic institutions, is expected to significantly accelerate GCC investments, and position AP as a national leader in the digital economy.

GCCs, which are the strategic units of multinational corporations handling R&D, IT, finance, procurement, and customer services, are among the fastest growing engines of global business. Unlike traditional outsourcing, GCCs are wholly owned by their parent companies, ensuring innovation, efficiency, and larger integration with global operations. With over 1,600 GCCs already operating in India, and employing 1.6 million professionals, Andhra Pradesh is now making an aggressive pitch to capture the next wave of investments.

The newly formed GCC Advisory Council has a wide-ranging mandate, including preparing a five-year strategic roadmap for AP’s GCC sector. Its focus includes creating a future-ready talent ecosystem through partnerships with IIT Tirupati, IIM Visakhapatnam, and skill development programmes, driving innovation and R&D through global collaborations, developing world-class infrastructure, including IT parks, plug-and-play facilities, and Grade-A commercial spaces, reviewing and monitoring IT & GCC Policy 4.0 implementation, and leading branding and global outreach via roadshows in the US, Europe, and Asia.

The move is intended to speed up Ikea’s presence in mature markets. It takes years to build large stores, while space inside Best Buy stores is ready right away. Ikea says these sites are in “white spots” where it does not currently operate, including Daytona Beach and Lakeland in Florida, and Humble and Mesquite in Texas. At the same time, Best Buy gains a new reason for shoppers to walk into its stores. That may be useful as consumer electronics chains face slowing demand after a surge in the pandemic years.

Meanwhile, BBY shares have climbed a modest 1.86% yesterday, closing at $77.59.

New Formats and Global Push

Over the past few years, Ikea has changed its business model. The retailer used to rely on big warehouses outside cities. Now it offers city center shops, online ordering, click and collect services, and home delivery with assembly. Customers like the convenience, though some complain about product availability in the smaller spaces.

Globally, Ikea holds a 5.7% share of the furniture market. It aims to increase this figure and is testing new formats in both stores and online. In China, the company sells on Alibaba’s (BABA) Tmall and, since last month, on JD.com (HK:9618). About one-fifth of new customers in the country now come from Tmall. Sales on JD.com in the first week were better than expected.

Executives say there are no plans to use third-party on-line sites in the United States or Europe. Instead, the Best Buy partnership may serve as a model in those regions. Ikea can use large stores as fulfillment centers for online orders, while new partnerships allow it to move faster.

Is Best Buy a Good Stock to Buy Now?

On the Street, Best Buy scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Out of 20 analysts’ ratings, eight rate it a Buy, with one analyst seeing it as a Sell. The average BBY stock price target is $79.67, implying a 2.68% upside from the current price.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

As the sector continues to consolidate, regional banks that navigate regulatory shifts with agility will emerge as the dominant players in the post-merger landscape.","The U.S. banking sector is undergoing a transformative phase, driven by regulatory tailwinds and a strategic shift toward scale-driven growth.

Financial Services Group’s $4.1 billion acquisition of Holding Company exemplifies this trend, positioning the regional bank to capitalize on favorable policy changes and market dynamics. As the Federal Reserve and banking regulators recalibrate capital requirements and antitrust enforcement, the stage is set for a new wave of consolidation in retail banking.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Easing Capital Constraints and Antitrust Scrutiny

Recent regulatory reforms have created a more permissive environment for M&A activity. The Federal Reserve’s proposed changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) for global systemically important banks (GSIBs) are particularly significant. By recalibrating the eSLR to function as a backstop rather than a binding constraint, the reform reduces required Tier 1 capital for GSIBs by approximately 1.4% at the holding-company level and 27% at the depository institution subsidiary level [1]. This easing of capital requirements frees up liquidity for strategic acquisitions, enabling banks like PNC to pursue growth without compromising regulatory compliance.

Simultaneously, antitrust enforcement has shifted under the Trump administration, with regulators adopting a more flexible approach to merger approvals. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have shown a willingness to accept structural remedies, such as divestitures of standalone businesses, rather than outright blocking deals [3]. This contrasts with the Biden administration’s aggressive antitrust stance, which led to the collapse of high-profile mergers like TD Bank’s acquisition of

. The current regulatory climate, therefore, provides a more predictable path for PNC’s $4.1 billion deal with FirstBank, which is expected to close in early 2026 [2].

Strategic Rationale: Expanding Market Presence and Digital Capabilities

PNC’s acquisition of FirstBank is a calculated move to strengthen its position in high-growth markets. FirstBank’s 95-branch network in Colorado and Arizona—regions with robust economic expansion—will triple PNC’s footprint in Colorado to 120 branches and expand its Arizona presence to over 70 branches [2]. This expansion aligns with PNC’s long-term strategy of leveraging strategic acquisitions to scale its retail and commercial banking operations.

The deal also underscores PNC’s commitment to digital innovation. FirstBank’s robust digital banking capabilities complement PNC’s existing technology infrastructure, enabling the combined entity to offer a seamless customer experience. As noted by

ISI analyst John Pancari, the acquisition “enhances PNC’s growth profile by integrating a digitally savvy regional player into its ecosystem” [3]. This synergy is critical in an era where embedded finance and digital-first banking are redefining customer expectations.

Market Implications: A Blueprint for Regional Bank Consolidation

PNC’s acquisition signals a broader trend of regional bank consolidation, driven by the need to achieve scale in a low-margin, high-competition environment. The Federal Reserve’s recent individual capital requirements for large banks, including stress capital buffers and G-SIB surcharges, have further incentivized mergers by reducing year-over-year volatility in regulatory expectations [4]. For regional banks, this stability lowers the risk of overpaying for acquisitions and ensures a clearer path to profitability.

Moreover, the regulatory reset has aligned with macroeconomic conditions. Improved economic growth and a more favorable interest rate environment in 2025 have bolstered investor confidence in M&A activity. PNC’s ability to retain all FirstBank branches and employees—ensuring continuity in community banking—demonstrates how strategic acquisitions can balance growth with local market engagement [2]. This model is likely to be replicated by peers seeking to expand without sacrificing customer trust.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Investors and the Banking Sector

PNC’s acquisition of FirstBank is more than a strategic expansion—it is a harbinger of a new era in U.S. banking. By leveraging regulatory tailwinds and aligning with market demands for scale and digital innovation, PNC is positioning itself to outperform in a competitive landscape. For investors, the deal represents a compelling opportunity to capitalize on the convergence of policy-driven growth and operational efficiency.

(Reuters) - U.S. bank said on Monday it would buy privately-held FirstBank Holding in a $4.1 billion cash-and-stock deal, adding momentum to a long-predicted wave of dealmaking among regional lenders.

The deal, which is expected to close in early 2026, will bring PNC closer to $600 billion in assets, and narrow its gap with rivals such as .

It will also help PNC to expand in the fast-growing markets of Colorado and Arizona, bolstering its position in the western United States.

Shares of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based PNC fell nearly 1% in morning trading.

PNC CEO Bill Demchak said in June that he expected consolidation in retail banking to boost industry profits.

FirstBank’s ""deep retail deposit base, unrivaled branch network in Colorado, (and) growing presence in Arizona make it an ideal partner,"" Demchak said in a statement on Monday.

PNC’s branch network in Colorado will more than triple to 120, becoming one of its biggest U.S. markets.

Discussions between the two banks started in the summer, and the transaction will help PNC strengthen its reach beyond its traditional stronghold on the east coast, Alex Overstrom, head of retail banking at PNC, told Reuters.

""We are a top five retail player in the United States,"" Overstrom said. ""Our ambition is to be one of the top, if not the top retail bank in the country. This transaction allows us to do that by increasing our scale and density in certain areas, which is really important in retail banking,"" Overstrom added.

Talk of potential mergers and acquisitions among Wall Street banks and large regional lenders increased at the start of the second half of the year in a major shift under the Trump administration after regulators under the Biden administration opposed or blocked big deals.

""PNC is prudently taking advantage of the warmer regulatory waters to gain scale in attractive markets via manageably-sized deals,"" said Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari.

WHAT NOW FOR PNC?

Investors and analysts had been widely anticipating PNC to acquire a bank, although some expressed surprise at the size of the transaction.

""While we aren’t surprised to see PNC re-enter the M&A arena given the current administration’s de-regulatory agenda, our sense is that investors were more hopeful for a larger splash,"" said Raymond James analyst Michael Rose.

The deal could also rule out PNC as an acquirer for another large bank, Piper Sandler analysts said.

""PNC has been a name associated as a potential buyer for ,"" the analysts said, but the FirstBank deal could take it out of the running.

Comerica, a regional lender with $78 billion in assets, is being pushed to sell itself by an activist investor. It did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

In July, regional lenders and agreed to combine in an $8.6 billion deal, the biggest U.S. bank acquisition this year.

Under the PNC deal, FirstBank stockholders will get roughly 13.9 million PNC shares and $1.2 billion in cash.

""At 5% of PNC’s size, FirstBank won’t materially move the needle, but added scale in Colorado and Arizona raises the company’s underlying growth profile and likely removes an overhang on the stock,"" Stephens analyst Terry McEvoy said.

FirstBank, which began offering banking services in 1963, manages $26.8 billion in assets and operates 95 branches.

FirstBank CEO Kevin Classen will become PNC’s Colorado regional president and mountain territory executive, which includes Arizona and Utah. Overstrom said that PNC will retain FirstBank client-facing employees.

He will succeed Amandine Ohayon, who has held the position of CEO for two years.
The choice of Tom Mendenhall seems a particularly wise decision.
Last year, Stella McCartney was named “Person of the Year 2024” by the animal rights organization PETA.
Since Stella McCartney regained her independence at the beginning of the year, the figures have continued to fall short of forecasts.","Stella McCartney has just appointed its new CEO: Tom Mendenhall. He will succeed Amandine Ohayon, who has held the position of CEO for two years. Why such a change now? Since the fashion house took a gamble on independence by buying back LVMH's minority stake, Stella McCartney has been facing tensions in the luxury market, which has been hit by a lasting crisis. The company has therefore implemented a recovery plan aimed at long-term growth.

The choice of Tom Mendenhall seems a particularly wise decision. In a statement, the businessman, who has extensive experience in the luxury sector, said he was “honored to now be working with Stella McCartney and her incredible international team on the next stage of the company's development.”

His expertise will be fundamental to the future of the company. Mendenhall has previously worked for Ralph Lauren, Gucci, and Tom Ford in various management positions. He is also the co-founder of the men's clothing brand Jamestown Hudson. His skills and experience will therefore be essential in giving the brand new momentum while enhancing its identity.

Amandine Ohayon, who had the difficult task of leading the company during the split with LVMH, will continue to serve as an advisor until Mendenhall officially takes up his position. Last year, Stella McCartney was named “Person of the Year 2024” by the animal rights organization PETA. Her status as a pioneer in ethical and sustainable fashion has allowed her to continue her role as an advisor to Bernard Arnault's group on environmental issues. But this prestige has not translated into financial success: in 2023, the company's turnover was around €26 million, compared to more than €47 million the previous year. Since Stella McCartney regained her independence at the beginning of the year, the figures have continued to fall short of forecasts. It must be said that the current economic climate, characterized by a multifactorial crisis (both economic and geopolitical), is particularly critical for mid-sized luxury brands, which do not benefit from the desirability of major international brands.",https://content.luxurytribune.com/app/uploads/2025/09/SMC_WI25_SHOW_DETAILS_4x5-8.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 10:08:39.280176

The closure of the Longs division, which includes the plants in Newcastle and Vereeniging, will directly and indirectly affect approximately 3,500 workers.
AMSA, formerly known as Iscor, has been a cornerstone of South Africa’s industrial landscape since its founding in 1928.
The company expanded significantly in the post-war years, with the Newcastle plant being commissioned in the 1970s.
However, its long-steel division has been suffering financial losses for many years due to logistical and energy challenges and unsustainable competition.","After 78 years of operation, ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) has confirmed that it will wind down its long-steel business, a move that will have a devastating economic impact on Newcastle and the surrounding areas. The decision, announced in a letter to employees on August 29, follows several failed attempts to secure support and address long-standing operational challenges.

AMSA’s CEO, Kobus Verster, stated in the letter that the company had “no option but to prepare for closure” after negotiations with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and the government fell through. The company will begin issuing Section 189 retrenchment notices on a staggered basis starting 1 September.

The closure of the Longs division, which includes the plants in Newcastle and Vereeniging, will directly and indirectly affect approximately 3,500 workers. The company cited a combination of factors for the decision, including rising imports, soaring electricity costs, poor rail performance, and weak local demand.

Trade union NUMSA has condemned the closure as a “social and economic catastrophe.” Analysts warn that the move highlights the broader decline of South Africa’s manufacturing sector. The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) echoed these concerns, with General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi stating that the decision will “devastate thousands of workers, their families, and entire communities.”

Vavi also highlighted the national implications of the closure, noting that South Africa will lose its last integrated carbon steel capacity. This will make the country “wholly dependent on imported steel, vulnerable to global pricing manipulation, and stripped of industrial sovereignty.” He pointed to the slow response by the state to combat the dumping of cheap steel, particularly from China, as a contributing factor.

Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group comes in at number four, while Lloyd’s is ranked at number 5 and SCOR is number six. (See chart below for the full top 40 list).

For the purposes of developing the top 40 ranking of global reinsurers and overcoming the issue of comparing reinsurers that report under the GAAP versus IFRS 17 accounting standards, the ratings agency referred to gross premium written (GPW) for pure reinsurance business.

“For those reinsurers reporting under IFRS 17 and that do not publish GPW, we estimated the pure reinsurance GPW and marked them in the ranking. At the same time, we added the gross insurance revenue for reinsurance for all IFRS 17 filers,” said S&P in its report titled “S&P Global Ratings’ Top 40 Global Reinsurers In 2025 And Reinsurers By Country,” published on Sept. 3.

One of the main challenges for creating this report, S&P said, was drawing a clear line between companies’ reinsurance and primary insurance activities, “especially in cases where the reinsurance operation is a division within a company and not a distinct business.”

“Generally, premium data relate to a company’s reinsurance premium written. In some cases, however, other metrics include data from the primary insurance and the reinsurance business. If we did not view the metrics provided by companies as representative of their reinsurance operations, we marked the relevant metrics as not available (N.A.).”

Further, for groups that write both non-life and life reinsurance businesses, the combined ratio reflects non-life business only.

The report also breaks down the top reinsurers by country.

Compiling almost ten years’ worth of materials data, in-house labs, and artificial intelligence, the ZYA platform is designed to optimize sustainability-minded material formulations. Colgate-Palmolive will be given direct access to the system and is set to play an ‘active role’ in aligning the system with its packaging roadmap.

The platform will present ‘hundreds’ of industry biopolymers, additives, and naturally occurring polymers by their performance, cost, and compliance. Colgate-Palmolive will use the resource to virtually design materials in line with its performance specs and sustainability targets.

This is expected to speed up material screening and boost the success rates of trials, thus reducing R&D time ‘significantly’. In turn, it is set to streamline the market launch and scaling process for new packaging designs as global policies and consumer demands evolve.

On a wider scale, the partnership is considered a step forward in the use of artificial intelligence to help consumer brands adopt new materials and help tackle plastic waste.

“At Erthos, we believe the future of packaging isn’t just about new materials—it’s about reimagining the systems behind them,” said CEO Nuha Siddiqui. “Through our partnership with Colgate-Palmolive, we’re building a new playbook for sustainable packaging with ZYA—demonstrating how technology, science, and leadership can unlock the scale and speed needed to move the world beyond plastic.”

“Improving the performance, usability, and sustainability of our packaging materials is a key priority for Colgate-Palmolive,” added Greg Corra, senior vice president of Global Packaging at Colgate-Palmolive. “We are very excited to support Erthos in their development of the ZYA platform, and eager to collaborate in accelerating and enhancing the material development process.”

Last year, Colgate-Palmolive expressed its concerns that ‘industry-wide challenges’ related to flexible packaging could become a roadblock in achieving its recyclable, reusable, and compostable packaging targets for 2025. It claimed to have reached 89.5% by the end of 2023.

In other AI-related news, Unilever, Amcor, and Asahi are just some of the consumer brands trialling Greyparrot’s waste intelligence platform, designed to offer product-level recyclable waste data and address knowledge gaps. Using AI-camera systems in material recovery facilities, the solution follows packaging through the waste system and records which units are sorted, recycled, or lost – generating real-world recycling rates for brands to reference in their packaging developments.

Gaspard Duthilleul, COO at Greyparrot, spoke to Packaging Europe to dive deeper into how the technology works and what the company has learned through its implementation.

By Kritika Lamba and Krystal Hu

(Reuters) - Data analytics firm Databricks said on Monday it was on track to hit $4 billion in annualized revenue on the back of booming demand for its artificial intelligence products, as it closed a $1 billion funding round.

The Series K funding valued the company at $100 billion, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The round was co-led by existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners, MGX, Thrive Capital and WCM Investment Management.

The company plans to use the proceeds to accelerate its AI strategy, including expanding products, launching a new operational database category, and future AI acquisitions and research.

In the second quarter, the company served around 15,000 customers, including energy major Shell and electric-vehicle maker Rivian, surpassing a $4 billion revenue run rate, with AI products reaching $1 billion.

Databricks is targeting a net revenue retention above 140%, more than 650 customers with more than $1 million in annual spending and positive free cash flow over the past 12 months, the company said.

CEO Ali Ghodsi said the company intends to remain cash-flow positive, which could keep the door open for an initial public listing, without committing to any specific timeline.

The raise could help the company invest more in AI products such as Agent Bricks, a platform that helps people build AI autonomous systems, as well as its data warehouse product Lakebase, which has already generated tens of millions in annualized revenue since its launch in June. It has been actively making acquisitions, including the recent buy of machine learning startup Tecton.

The San Francisco-based company has long been seen as a leading candidate to go public. The firm has received numerous investor inquiries since the successful $1.22 billion initial public offering of design software firm Figma, another venture capital-backed startup, in July, according to Ghodsi.

Databricks, founded in 2013, offers a platform designed to help users ingest, analyze and build AI applications.

The interplay of these forces has reshaped investment landscapes, creating both challenges and opportunities for forward-looking investors. This analysis explores how corporations are leveraging AI-driven solutions and currency-hedged strategies to navigate uncertainty, and identifies actionable investment opportunities in sectors poised to outperform.

Tariffs and AI: A Strategic Counterbalance

The imposition of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has forced companies to rethink supply chains and capital allocation. For example, Colgate-Palmolive and General Motors have adopted flexible sourcing strategies to mitigate retaliatory measures, while Texas-based firms have increased AI adoption by 59.1% to offset tariff-driven costs [1]. AI is proving critical in optimizing logistics and supplier diversification. A U.S. automaker, for instance, used data observability tools to reroute EV battery production to Vietnam and India, cutting costs by 12% amid Biden-era tariffs [3].

Beyond cost management, AI is driving productivity gains. Microsoft’s AI-driven code-writing tools now handle 30% of internal development, saving $500 million annually [1]. Similarly, Walmart leveraged AI to predict supply chain bottlenecks, avoiding $5 million in losses during the 2024 tariff crisis [4]. These examples underscore AI’s role in transforming operational resilience, making it a cornerstone of corporate strategy.

Dollar Strength and Hedging: Mitigating Currency Volatility

The U.S. dollar’s 6% appreciation in trade-weighted terms during Q4 2024 pressured multinational earnings, particularly in technology and consumer goods. Apple and Procter & Gamble both reported reduced overseas revenues due to foreign exchange fluctuations [1]. To counter this, firms are adopting dynamic hedging strategies. For instance, the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (HEEM) locks in currency prices via forward contracts, reducing exposure to volatile markets [3]. WisdomTree’s DDWM fund, which adjusts hedge ratios based on interest rate differentials and momentum signals, has delivered 8.3% annual returns since 2016 [4].

The dollar’s long-term strength faces headwinds as global investors diversify into non-U.S. assets, driven by concerns over fiscal sustainability [2]. This shift has spurred demand for hedged ETFs, with flows increasingly favoring products that balance U.S. growth with international diversification.

AI-Driven Investment Opportunities: Hyperscalers and Semiconductors

The AI infrastructure boom is fueling growth in semiconductors and cloud computing. NVIDIA’s Q4 2024 revenue surged 265.3% year-over-year, driven by demand for its Hopper GPU and Blackwell processors, which are already sold out until late 2025 [3]. TSMC and ASML are also benefiting: ASML’s Q4 net bookings doubled to €7.09 billion, despite geopolitical risks in China [2]. For investors, the Vaneck Vectors Semiconductor UCITS ETF offers broad exposure to 25 global leaders in this space [1].

Meanwhile, AI adoption in non-technology sectors is gaining traction. Citigroup’s AI initiatives in fraud detection and operational automation highlight the financial sector’s potential for productivity-driven growth [1].

Currency-Hedged ETFs: Balancing Risk and Return

For investors seeking to hedge against dollar volatility, HEEM and DDWM provide tailored solutions. HEEM’s focus on emerging markets, combined with currency hedging, mitigates the drag of local currency depreciation. DDWM’s dynamic approach, which adjusts hedge ratios based on market conditions, offers flexibility in uncertain environments [4]. However, investors should weigh higher management fees and tax inefficiencies inherent in these strategies [3].

Case Studies: AI as a Tariff Mitigation Tool

Walmart: AI-powered predictive analytics enabled $5 million in savings by rerouting shipments during the 2024 tariff crisis [4].

European Automaker: AI-driven supplier diversification reduced high-tariff region dependence by 15% [4].

Texas Firms: 25% of companies plan to increase automation to counteract tariffs, per the Dallas Fed [1].

Actionable Recommendations

AI-Driven Sectors: Invest in hyperscalers (NVIDIA, Microsoft) and semiconductor ETFs (Vaneck Semiconductor UCITS) to capitalize on infrastructure demand.

Currency-Hedged ETFs: Allocate to HEEM for emerging markets exposure and DDWM for dynamic hedging.

AI-Adopting Industries: Target financials (Citigroup) and manufacturing firms leveraging AI for supply chain resilience.

Conclusion

Q4 2024 has underscored the necessity of adaptive strategies in a landscape defined by tariffs and dollar strength. Companies that integrate AI into their operations and adopt currency-hedged investments are best positioned to thrive. For investors, the path forward lies in aligning portfolios with these transformative trends, prioritizing sectors where technological innovation and macroeconomic agility converge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 06:07:03.203393

This growth comes at a time when, due to restrictions, apparel exports to India are allowed only through Chittagong port.
This marks nearly 16.5 per cent growth in apparel exports.
By that count, there has been an increase of 15 per cent in the apparel export following the ban.
Currently, all apparel exports to India are routed through Chittagong seaport.","Bangladesh’s apparel exports fell in August but, shipments to India increased. This growth comes at a time when, due to restrictions, apparel exports to India are allowed only through Chittagong port.

Over the past four months, India imposed restrictions three times on imports via land ports. On 17 May, apparel was among the goods hit by the first ban.

According to India’s restrictions, its importers were barred from bringing apparel through land ports. Only the ports of Nhava Sheva in Mumbai and Kolkata remained open.

To send goods to Nhava Sheva, shipments from Chittagong seaport must pass through Sri Lanka’s Colombo port first, involving four rounds of container loading and unloading, which raises the cost and time both.

Data from the National Board of Revenue (NBR) show that in August, two and a half months after the restrictions being imposed, Bangladesh exported apparel worth USD 80.6 million (USD 8.06 crore) to India.

During the same month last year, the figure was USD 69.2 million (USD 6.92 crore). This marks nearly 16.5 per cent growth in apparel exports.

According to NBR figures, in the three months (June–August) after the ban being imposed, Bangladesh exported apparel worth USD 183.5 million (USD 18.35 crore) to India, compared to USD 159.1 million (USD 15.91 crore) during the same quarter last year.

By that count, there has been an increase of 15 per cent in the apparel export following the ban.

Currently, all apparel exports to India are routed through Chittagong seaport. Before the ban was imposed on export through land ports, 30 per cent of the apparel was shipped via Chittagong port, 69 per cent through land ports with about 1 per cent sent by air.

Meanwhile, Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) data show that Bangladesh’s overall apparel exports in August fell by 4.75 per cent to about USD 3.17 billion (USD 317 crore), down from USD 3.33 billion (USD 333 crore) recorded in the same month last year.

During the same period last year Bangladesh had exported goods worth USD 302.8 million (USD 30.28 crore). That means export to India increased by around 4 per cent on the whole.

India is Bangladesh’s eighth-largest export destination, and within Asia, it is the largest. Bangladesh exported goods worth nearly USD 1.82 billion (USD 182 crore) to India in the 2024–25 fiscal year.

Apparel accounted for 36 per cent of this export, while non-apparel goods made up the remaining 64 per cent.",https://media.prothomalo.com/prothomalo-english%2F2025-09-09%2F2hckq6qb%2Fprothomalo-bangla2021-055f28f541-cead-462f-8efd-f581f133b11fa22f455a-68b6-4918-a0c6-5a51031e49ff.avif?rect=0%2C0%2C622%2C327&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&overlay=&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width_pct=1,N,,2025-09-09 04:02:42.372512

While its early success demonstrated the viability of premium pet food, the company’s current challenges underscore the sector’s evolving dynamics.","The premium pet food sector, once a golden child of the post-pandemic consumer boom, is showing signs of strain. Freshpet, a pioneer in the fresh, refrigerated pet food category, has epitomized this shift. In 2024, the company celebrated a “breakout” year, reporting $975.2 million in net sales and its first full-year net income of $46.9 million [1]. Yet, by Q1 2025, Freshpet posted a $12.7 million net loss, citing increased media spending and economic headwinds [3]. This volatility raises a critical question: Is the premium pet food model reaching its limits in a market increasingly defined by cost-conscious consumers and fragmented demand?

The Freshpet Paradox: Growth, Margin Gains, and Structural Weaknesses

Freshpet’s 2024 success was built on a combination of cost optimization and strategic retail partnerships. Gross margins improved to 40.6% from 32.7% in 2023, driven by lower input costs and plant efficiency [1]. However, the company’s reliance on premium pricing and a retail-centric distribution model has exposed vulnerabilities. In Q1 2025, despite 18% sales growth, Freshpet’s adjusted EBITDA dipped to $35.5 million from $43.5 million in Q3 2024 [5]. This reflects a broader trend: as the U.S. premium pet food market grows at a modest 0.5% CAGR [3], companies like Freshpet must balance innovation with affordability to retain price-sensitive customers.

The company’s revised 2025 guidance—projecting $1.12–$1.15 billion in sales—acknowledges a slowdown in new customer acquisition [4]. This is a stark contrast to the hypergrowth of 2021–2023, when pet owners treated pets as family members and splurged on premium products. Now, with inflation and wage stagnation constraining budgets, consumers are recalibrating. According to Euromonitor, 68% of Gen Z and 69% of Millennials still view pets as family, but their spending priorities have shifted toward value [4].

Walmart’s Omnichannel Edge: Affordability Meets Convenience

While Freshpet struggles with margin compression, Walmart has leveraged its omnichannel strategy to dominate the value segment. The retailer’s private-label brands, such as Goodlands and Zuke’s Dog Treats, offer high-quality alternatives at lower price points, capturing 0.5 percentage points of market share in 2024 [1]. Walmart’s integration of in-store Pet Services Centers and virtual vet care further enhances its appeal, addressing pet owners’ growing demand for holistic, affordable solutions [3].

Walmart’s e-commerce expansion has also been a game-changer. Over 70% of pet owners purchased supplies online in 2024, with platforms like Amazon and Walmart benefiting from repeat purchases [1]. By combining fast delivery, in-store pickup, and subscription models, Walmart has created a seamless experience that rivals Freshpet’s retail partnerships. For example, Walmart’s subscription-based dog food and dental treats cater to convenience-driven buyers, a demographic that Freshpet’s refrigerated, single-serve format may not fully address [2].

Colgate’s Resilience: Innovation and Cost Discipline in a Volatile Market

Colgate-Palmolive’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment offers a blueprint for navigating market volatility. In Q2 2025, Hill’s reported a 3.8% sales increase, driven by innovations like the Science Diet ActivBiome+ line and a targeted advertising campaign [2]. Crucially, Colgate’s disciplined cost management—via a three-year productivity program—has allowed it to maintain profitability despite rising raw material costs and tariffs.

Unlike Freshpet, which relies heavily on retail partnerships, Colgate has diversified its channels, including veterinary and online sales. This flexibility has insulated Hill’s from the same economic pressures facing Freshpet. For instance, Hill’s Prescription Diet line saw strong volume growth in Q2 2025, capitalizing on pet owners’ willingness to pay for specialized nutrition [2]. Colgate’s ability to balance premium positioning with operational efficiency underscores the importance of structural resilience in a maturing market.

The Premium Model at a Crossroads

The premium pet food sector’s growth is no longer a given. While the global market is projected to expand at 5.6% CAGR through 2034 [2], U.S. premium pet food revenue grew at a mere 0.1% CAGR from 2020–2025 [3]. This moderation reflects a shift from “premiumization” to “value-conscious premiumization.” Consumers are still willing to pay a premium for quality but are increasingly price-sensitive in their purchasing decisions.

Freshpet’s struggles highlight the risks of over-reliance on a retail-driven model. Its distribution strategy—relying on 27,000 stores and custom refrigerators—requires high fixed costs and leaves it vulnerable to margin pressures. In contrast, Walmart’s omnichannel approach and Colgate’s diversified, innovation-led strategy offer more scalable paths to growth.

Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale for Disruptors

Freshpet’s story is a cautionary tale for companies betting on retail-driven disruption. While its early success demonstrated the viability of premium pet food, the company’s current challenges underscore the sector’s evolving dynamics. Walmart and Colgate, by contrast, have adapted to macroeconomic pressures through affordability, innovation, and operational agility. For investors, the lesson is clear: the premium pet food model is not dead, but it requires a more nuanced approach—one that balances quality with accessibility and leverages omnichannel and product diversification to weather volatility.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 10:07:17.274037

In 2001, the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks turbocharged interest in surveillance technology.","BEIJING (AP) — The body camera hung from the top of the IV drip, recording the slightest twitch made by Yang Guoliang as he lay bloody and paralyzed in a hospital bed after a police beating with bricks.

By then, surveillance was nothing new for the Yang family in rural China, snared in an intricate network based on U.S. technology that spies on them and predicts what they’ll do.

Their train tickets, hotel bookings, purchases, text messages and phone calls are forwarded to the government. Their house is ringed with more than a dozen cameras. They’ve tried to go to Beijing 20 times in the past few years, but masked men show up and grab them, often before they depart. And last year, Yang’s wife and younger daughter were detained and now face trial for disrupting the work of the Chinese state — a crime carrying a sentence of up to a decade in prison.

Yet the Yangs say they are not criminals. They are simply farmers trying to beg Beijing to stop local officials from seizing their 1 1/2 acres of land in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.

“Every move in my own home is monitored,” Yang said, sitting behind black curtains that block him from the glare of police lights trained straight at his house. “Their surveillance makes me feel unsafe all the time, everywhere.”

Across China, tens of thousands of people tagged as troublemakers like the Yangs are trapped in a digital cage, barred from leaving their province and sometimes even their homes by the world’s largest digital surveillance apparatus. Most of this technology came from companies in a country that has long claimed to support freedoms worldwide: the United States.

Over the past quarter century, American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies, despite repeated warningsfrom the U.S. Congress and in the media that such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious sects and target minorities.

Critically, American surveillance technologies allowed a brutal mass detention campaign in the far west region of Xinjiang — targeting, tracking and grading virtually the entire native Uyghur population to forcibly assimilate and subdue them.

U.S. companies did this by bringing “predictive policing” to China — technology that sucks in and analyzes data to prevent crime, protests, or terror attacks before they happen. Such systems mine a vast array of information — texts, calls, payments, flights, video, DNA swabs, mail deliveries, the internet, even water and power use — to unearth individuals deemed suspicious and predict their behavior. But they also allow Chinese police to threaten friends and family and preemptively detain people for crimes they have not even committed.

For example, the AP found a Chinese defense contractor, Huadi, worked with IBM to design the main policing system known as the “Golden Shield” for Beijing to censor the internet and crack down on alleged terrorists, the Falun Gong religious sect, and even villagers deemed troublesome, according to thousands of pages of classified government blueprints taken out of China by a whistleblower, verified by AP and revealed here for the first time. IBM and other companies that responded said they fully complied with all laws, sanctions and U.S. export controls governing business in China, past and present.

Across China, surveillance systems track blacklisted “key persons,” whose movements are restricted and monitored. In Xinjiang, administrators logged people as high, medium, or low risk, often according to 100-point scores with deductions for factors like growing a beard, being 15 to 55 years old, or just being Uyghur.

Some tech companies even specifically addressed race in their marketing. Dell and a Chinese surveillance firm promoted a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop with “all-race recognition” on Dell's official WeChat account in 2019. And until contacted by AP in August, biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific’s website marketed DNA kits to the Chinese police as “designed” for the Chinese population, including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans.”

While the flood of American technology slowed considerably starting in 2019 after outrage and sanctions over atrocities in Xinjiang, it laid the foundation for China’s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced. To this day, concerns remain over where technology sold to China will end up.

For example, 20 former U.S. officials and national security experts wrote a letter in late July criticizing a deal for NVIDIA to sell H20 chips used in artificial intelligence to China, with 15% of revenues going to the U.S. government. They said no matter who the chip is sold to, it will fall into the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.

NVIDIA said it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed the H20 for police surveillance. NVIDIA posted on its WeChat social media account in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix and GEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol drones and systems to identify people by their walk, but told the AP those relationships no longer continue. The White House and Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.

Thermo Fisher and hard drive maker Seagate promoted their products to Chinese police at conferences and trade shows this year, according to online posts. Officers stroll the streets of Beijing with Motorola walkie talkies. NVIDIA and Intel chips remain critical for Chinese policing systems, procurements show. And contracts to maintain existing IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft software and gear remain ubiquitous, often with third parties.

What started in China more than a decade ago could be seen as a cautionary tale for other countries at a time when the use of surveillance technology worldwide is rising sharply, including in the United States. Emboldened by the Trump administration, U.S. tech companies are more powerful than ever, and President Donald Trump has rolled back a Biden-era executive order meant to safeguard civil rights from new surveillance technologies.

As the capacity and sophistication of such technologies has grown, so has their reach. Surveillance technologies now include AI systems that help track and detain migrants in the U.S. and identify people to kill in the Israel-Hamas war. China, in the meantime, has used what it learned from the U.S. to turn itself into a surveillance superpower, selling technologies to countries like Iran and Russia.

The AP investigation was based on tens of thousands of leaked emails and databases from a Chinese surveillance company; tens of thousands of pages of confidential corporate and government documents; public Chinese language marketing material; and thousands of procurements, many provided by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the non-profit Asia Society. The AP also drew from dozens of open record requests and interviews with more than 100 current and former Chinese and American engineers, executives, experts, officials, administrators, and police officers.

Though the companies often claim they aren’t responsible for how their products are used, some directly pitched their tech as tools for Chinese police to control citizens, marketing material from IBM, Dell, Cisco, and Seagate show. Their sales pitches — made both publicly and privately — cited Communist Party catchphrases on crushing protest, including “stability maintenance,” “key persons,” and “abnormal gatherings,” and named programs that stifle dissent, such as “Internet Police,” “Sharp Eyes” and the “Golden Shield.”

Other companies, like Intel, NVIDIA, Oracle, Thermo Fisher, Motorola, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Western Digital, creator of mapping software ArcGIS Esri, and what was then Hewlett Packard, or HP, also sold technology or services knowingly to Chinese police or surveillance companies. Four practicing lawyers said sales like those uncovered by AP could potentially go against at least the spirit, if not the letter, of U.S. export laws at the time, which the companies denied.

American technology made up nearly every part of China’s surveillance apparatus, AP found:

MILITARY AND POLICE: In 2009, Chinese defense contractor Huadi worked with IBM to build national intelligence systems, including a counterterrorism system, used by the Chinese military and China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security. Chinese agents sold IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to the same ministry and to Chinese police, including in Xinjiang, through the 2010s, leaked emails and marketing posts show. IBM said it has no record of its i2 software ever having been sold to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.

SURVEILLANCE: NVIDIA and Intel partnered with China’s three biggest surveillance companies to add AI capabilities to camera systems used for video surveillance across China, including Xinjiang and Tibet, until sanctions were imposed. NVIDIA said in a post dating to 2013 or later that a Chinese police institute used its chips for surveillance technology research.

ETHNIC REPRESSION: IBM, Oracle, HP, and ArcGIS developer Esri sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of geographic and mapping software to Chinese police that allows officers to detect when blacklisted Uyghurs, Tibetans or dissidents stray out of provinces or villages. As late as 2019, with detentions in Xinjiang well underway, Dell hosted an industry summit in its capital. Dell and then-subsidiary VMWare sold cloud software and storage devices to police and entities providing data to police in Tibet and Xinjiang, even in 2022 after abuses there became widely known.

IDENTIFICATION: Huadi worked with IBM to construct China’s national fingerprint database; IBM told AP it never sold “fingerprinting-specific product or technology” to the Chinese government “in violation of US law.” HP and VMWare sold technology used for fingerprint comparison by Chinese police, while Intel partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company to make their devices more effective. IBM, Dell, and VMWare also promoted facial recognition to Chinese police. China’s police and police DNA labs bought IBM, Dell and Microsoft software and equipment to save genetic data on police databases.

CENSORSHIP AND CONTROL: In 2016, Dell boasted on its WeChat account that its services assisted the Chinese internet police in “cracking down on rumormongers.” Seagate said on WeChat in 2022 that it sells hard drives “tailor made” for AI video systems in China for use by police to help them ”control key persons,” despite facing backlash for selling drives in Xinjiang.

“Everything was built on American tech,” said Valentin Weber, a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations who studied the use of U.S. tech by Chinese police. “China’s capability was close to zero.”

IBM, Dell, Cisco, Intel, Thermo Fisher and Amazon Web Services all said they adhere to export control policies. Seagate and Western Digital said they adhere to all relevant laws and regulations where they operate.

Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and tech conglomerate Broadcom, which acquired VMWare and cloud company Pivotal in 2023, did not comment on the record; HP, Motorola and Huadi did not respond, and Esri denied involvement but did not reply to examples. Microsoft told AP it found no evidence that it “knowingly sold technology to the military or police” as part of the “Golden Shield” update.

Some U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions. For example, IBM said it has prohibited sales to Tibet and Xinjiang police since 2015, and suspended business relations with defense contractor Huadi in 2019.

However, sanctions experts noted that the laws have significant loopholes and often lag behind new developments. For example, a ban on military and policing gear to China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre does not take into account newer technologies or general-use products that can be applied in policing.

They also noted that the law around export controls is complicated. Raj Bhala, an expert in international trade law at the University of Kansas, said the issues the AP described fell into “the kind of gray area that we put in exams.”

“It would raise concerns about possible inconsistencies, possible violations,” said Bhala, who emphasized he was speaking generally and not about any specific company. “But I really stress ‘possible.’ We need to know more facts.”

While German, Japanese and Korean firms also played a role, American tech firms were by far the biggest suppliers.

The Xinjiang government said in a statement that it uses surveillance technologies to “prevent and combat terrorist and criminal activity,” that it respects citizens’ privacy and legal rights and that it does not target any particular ethnicity. The statement said Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.” Other government agencies did not respond to a request for comment, including China’s police and authorities in the Yangs’ province.

This technology still powers the police database that controls the Yangs and other ordinary people. An estimate based on Chinese government statistics found at least 55,000 to 110,000 were put under residential surveillance in the past decade, and vast numbers are restricted from travel in Xinjiang and Tibet. China’s cities, roads and villages are now studded with more cameras than the rest of the world combined, analysts say — one for every two people.

“Because of this technology … we have no freedom at all,” said Yang Guoliang’s elder daughter, Yang Caiying, now in exile in Japan. “At the moment, it’s us Chinese that are suffering the consequences, but sooner or later, Americans and others, too, will lose their freedoms.”

Selling surveillance superpowers

Back when China was emerging from the chaotic violence of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, three in four Chinese were farmers, including the Yangs. They lived in a three-room home of tiles and pounded earth nestled among the lush, humid fields of the Yangtze River delta.

After Chairman Mao Zedong’s death that year, Beijing’s new leaders opened China to the world, and American tech firms like HP and IBM rushed in. But there were hard limits on how much change the government would accept. In 1989, the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests rattled Beijing, which sent tanks and troops to shoot students.

Soon after, Beijing began planning the “Golden Shield,” aimed at digitizing China’s police force.

In 2001, the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks turbocharged interest in surveillance technology. One researcher claimed authorities could have foiled the attack by unearthing connections between hijackers through public information in databases.

American companies cashed in, selling the U.S. billions of dollars in surveillance technologies they said could prevent crime and terror attacks.

They spotted the same sales opportunity in China. Researchers warned surveillance technologies would be “instruments of repression” in the hands of authoritarian states. Yet IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and other American companies clinched orders to supply Beijing’s “Golden Shield.”

“China didn’t have this kind of thing before,” said Wang, a former Chinese police official in Xinjiang who asked to be identified only by last name for fear of retaliation. “These concepts all came from the West.”

Soon, disturbing stories emerged. Chinese police blocked sensitive news, pinpointing dissidents with unnerving precision. They stalked adherents of the Falun Gong sect banned by authorities. Congress demanded explanations from tech companies.

In 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web. Followers sued Cisco, which is now petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out the lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit.

At a human rights conference in February, then-Cisco lawyer Katie Shay said companies had a responsibility to understand how customers might misuse their technology for “surveillance and censorship.”

“A lot of people have suffered at the hands of their government, and I want to acknowledge that pain,” said Shay, who left Cisco in June. “I also will say that Cisco disputes the allegations of Cisco’s involvement.”

Cisco told the AP it is committed to human rights, but the court allegations may “open the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services.”

As Cisco was summoned before Congress, IBM partnered with a Chinese defense contractor on Phase Two of China’s “Golden Shield.”

Classified government blueprints obtained by AP show that in 2009, IBM worked with Huadi, the state-owned subsidiary of China’s biggest missile military contractor spun off from China’s Ministry of Defense, to build out predictive policing.

“Consolidate Communist Party rule,” read the Huadi blueprint, which showed the databases would track hundreds of thousands of people online.

In response to AP’s questions, IBM referred to any possible relationship it may have had with Chinese government agencies as “old, stale interactions”:

“ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.”

Back in 2009, Beijing needed the technology urgently to quash critics bonding online. Among them were the Yangs.

In April that year, local authorities ordered the Yangs and more than 300 other families in their village off their land. Developers coveted their prime lakefront property for “Western-style” apartments and villas, with fountains, football fields and shopping centers.

The Yangs had no idea police were installing systems that could target families like theirs. They just knew their land was being seized — in return for just a unit in a five-floor walk-up, too many stairs for their elderly mother to climb.

The Yangs and other farmers across China filed complaints.

“I discovered the way the government took our land was illegal,” Yang Caiying said. “They cheated us.”

Predict and prevent

In July 2009, three months after the Yang land was seized, riots erupted on the other side of the country in Xinjiang. Gory images of a Uyghur lynched at a toy factory spread online, angry Uyghurs took to the streets, and hundreds were killed.

Once again, American firms pitched their technology as the solution.

The government sent troops and cut Xinjiang’s phone and internet connections. In secret meetings, officials concluded that police had failed to spot the danger signs because they couldn’t identify Uyghurs deemed separatists, terrorists, and religious extremists, three engineers then working for the Xinjiang government told AP.

At the time, Xinjiang police and data systems were already running on American technology including IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft, the engineers said, which AP verified by reviewing government contracts. But the databases were unconnected.

So Xinjiang launched an ambitious initiative to fuse data from all available sources, including banks, railways, and phone companies, into a central database. Officials demanded complete information on all suspicious individuals and their relatives going back three generations, according to the engineers, who described specific meetings in which they participated. Two asked to remain anonymous, fearing for their family in China; the third, Nureli Abliz, is now in Germany.

Soon, lucrative contracts went up for bidding. Among those seeking to profit was IBM.

“Prevent problems before they happen,” IBM promised Chinese officials. In an August 2009 pamphlet, IBM cited the Xinjiang riots and said its technology could help the government “ensure urban safety and stability.”

IBM executives fanned out across the country to court Chinese officials. In December 2009, they set up a new “IBM Institute for Electronic Governance Innovation” in Beijing. In 2011, IBM acquired i2, a software program designed to prevent “terrorist threats.” IBM touted i2’s ability to analyze Chinese social media and licensed a Shanghai-based firm called Landasoft to sell it to China’s police, corporate records show.

Chinese police purchased tens of millions of dollars’ worth of products from companies like IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft to upgrade the “Golden Shield” policing systems, a leaked accounting ledger acquired by AP from a whistleblower shows.

In the confrontation between the Chinese state and its critics, American technology tipped the scales of power.

In 2011, thieves ransacked the Yangs’ house, hunting for their property deed. They didn’t find it.

Two years later, bald men with tattoos and gold chains smashed down their door, shattered windows and flipped furniture to bully them out of their home anyway. Yang’s mother dropped to the floor in terror. Doctors diagnosed a heart attack, but the Yangs didn’t have money for a pacemaker.

Furious, the Yangs sued local police. In June 2015, a judge ruled their land had been seized illegally. The Yangs celebrated.

But just weeks after the ruling, officers identified human rights lawyers through the “Golden Shield” technology, cuffed hundreds of them and pressed them into police vans across China. One lawyer later recalled how police monitored his messages on human rights in WeChat before they grabbed him, shackled him to a chair, and tortured him.

Overnight, China’s budding rights-defense movement was dealt a fatal blow — and with it, the Yangs’ case. The Yangs were called in and curtly told the judgment was being overturned, their lawsuit dismissed without trial.

“We really had too much faith in the law, you know?” Yang Guoliang said, his hands clenched in fists. “It turned out to be worthless.”

Technologies of terror

In the meantime, Beijing was transforming Xinjiang into the most heavily surveilled place on earth, sweeping around a million people into camps and prisons.

When bombs tore through a train station in Xinjiang’s capital hours after a visit by leader Xi Jinping in 2014, Xi demanded a crackdown.

“He was super angry,” said Abliz, one of the engineers with the Xinjiang government. “They concluded they weren’t surveilling Uyghurs closely enough.”

The next year, in April 2015, Abliz attended a closed-door exposition in Xinjiang. A booth ran by Landasoft, the former IBM partner, caught his eye.

After years as a vendor of IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to Xinjiang police, Landasoft had struck out on its own, touting i2-like software it said could detain extremists before they caused trouble. The similarity was no coincidence: Landasoft’s software was copied from i2, according to leaked emails and records.

“The platform is developed based on i2,” a Landasoft project manager wrote in an email.

It used a proprietary data visualization system developed by i2. The software powered what was called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, or IJOP, with the authority to trigger arrests.

Abliz went numb.

“I thought then that this was the end of humanity,” he said.

Landasoft did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IBM said it cut ties with Landasoft in 2014 and was not aware of any interaction between Landasoft and the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.

In the autumn of 2015, months after the Xinjiang expo, Landasoft signed contracts with Xinjiang police, emails show. Workers installed millions of cameras and wired over 7,000 police outposts, often built just hundreds of meters apart. Nearly 100,000 officers were recruited to pound on doors and collect names, addresses, fingerprints and face-scans.

Though Chinese hardware was favored, foreign software was irreplaceable for its performance and compatibility with China’s American-built systems, engineers told AP. That included server and database software from Oracle and Microsoft and cloud software from VMWare, which Dell acquired in 2016.

In late 2016, the crackdown began. Internal documents, a leaked copy of the Landasoft software and interviews with 16 former Xinjiang police officers, officials and engineers reveal how the system worked.

Landasoft’s software combined data fed into a central police database to compile a dossier on vast swaths of Xinjiang’s population, tagging them with categories like “went on pilgrimage” or “studied abroad.” Administrators then questioned them, computed risk scores and decided who to detain.

Hundreds of thousands of people were tagged “untrustworthy”, leaked messages show. Leaked documents show the IJOP flagged 24,412 people as “suspicious” in just one week in 2017, leading to most being detained.

“They thought it better to grab thousands of innocents than let a single criminal slip free,” Abliz said.

The technology was crude and flawed. Landasoft emails show engineers frantically fixing a software bug to release hundreds of people categorized as high-risk. And surveillance cameras often misidentified people, a former Xinjiang police officer found when he checked their ID cards.

Yet officers were told “computers cannot lie” and that the IJOP’s listed targets were “absolutely correct,” Abliz said. The software’s orders were often obeyed fearfully, unquestioningly.

“The tech companies told the government their software is perfect,” Abliz said. “It’s all a myth.”

Minority report

The all-encompassing surveillance forced total compliance: Officers arrested colleagues, neighbors informed on each other.

In May 2017, Kalbinur Sidik, a teacher now in the Netherlands, was summoned to her district government office in a yellow brick apartment building in Xinjiang’s capital. A young Uyghur woman, fresh from college, rose and introduced herself as a local official. Sidik, the woman explained, was being appointed as the head of her building, responsible for collecting information on neighbors.

“What’s this data going to be used for?” Sidik asked.

The woman looked at a computer, with a Landasoft program running and lists of names and tags: “Goes out at night,” “Overseas phone,” “unemployed.” One button stood out: “Push Alert.”

The woman clicked it, and the screen filled with names. These people, the woman explained, would be detained and interrogated for suspected ties to terrorism. Sidik’s eyes widened.

“I hated her for what she was doing,” Sidik said. “I knew those people would disappear.”

Xinjiang officials issued arrest quotas, Sidik and five other former officers and administrators said. Sidik watched with horror as the number of people who attended her compound’s weekly mandatory flag-raising ceremony shrank, from 400 to just over 100, as residents were arrested.

At the district office, she observed the logos popping up on screens: Oracle, Microsoft, Intel. The AP found evidence of products from all three companies used in Xinjiang’s policing and data systems during the crackdown, along with Esri, Seagate, Western Digital, NVIDIA, Thermo Fisher, and VMWare, then owned by Dell, which advertised cooperation with Xinjiang authorities on its website.

Sidik asked her neighborhood official where it all came from.

“We’ve spent a lot of money to import foreign technology,” she recalls the official telling her.

Among those caught in the digital dragnet was Parida Qabylqai, an ethnic Kazakh pharmacist at a military hospital in Xinjiang.

In February 2018, Qabylqai was flagged by the IJOP for visiting her parents in Kazakhstan. At first, her boss thought it was a mistake.

“You’re a good person, you shouldn’t be listed,” she recalled him saying. Then he checked the IJOP and spotted her name.

“It’s really serious! You’re going to end up in the camps,” he blurted out in shock.

An officer pressed a confession into her hands.

“What did I do wrong?” Qabylqai asked.

“Just sign!” the officer shouted.

Qabylqai was cuffed, hooded, and whisked to a camp, where cameras watched her day and night, even peering at her naked body in the toilet. Guards barking over speakers ordered her not to speak or even to move.

“They did things to us that no human being should ever have to experience,” she said. “But they said my name was listed by the IJOP, so they didn’t need to explain anything.”

Even enforcers of the system weren’t spared.

In 2018, Liu Yuliang, a civil servant in Xinjiang, was ordered to the home of a young police officer in his village. He and dozens of others stood, silent, as the officer embraced his sobbing, pregnant wife.

The officer had forced many people into the camps. Then he himself was flagged for detention.

Too fearful to resist, Liu went along with the arrest, just as the young officer had done before him.

Landasoft software alerted police when flagged people did anything labeled suspicious, like going out at night or logging on the internet repeatedly. Liu was sent to knock on doors, questioning residents whose “eyes filled with fear.”

As police swept Xinjiang, Landasoft purchased software from Pivotal, a cloud company later acquired by Broadcom, emails show. And Landasoft registered accounts on both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in 2018, seeking to expand cloud offerings to police clients, emails show.

AWS said Landasoft “consumed very limited cloud services for a brief period” and not for software in the Xinjiang crackdown. Microsoft said Landasoft used Azure services through a self-service portal retired in 2021, and that any Landasoft data was deleted.

The Xinjiang government told the AP: “There is absolutely no such thing as ‘large-scale human rights violations.’”

Liu eventually resigned and returned to his hometown in eastern China, trying to forget what he had seen and done. But he noted with unease the new cameras and checkpoints being installed around his home.

Four days later, state security called and summoned him for questioning. The all-seeing surveillance apparatus had followed him home.

“The Xinjiang model is being copied everywhere, in every city in China,” Liu said.

In 2024, Liu left China, ignoring an airport officer who warned that wherever he went, he would be watched.

“This technology has no emotions,” Liu said. “But in the hands of a government that doesn’t respect the law, it becomes a tool for evil.”

Automated autocracy

The Yangs are still trapped by U.S. technology. IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, and Seagate servers, switches and drives power police systems targeting them, maintenance contracts dating to this year show. Intel and NVIDIA chips process data. Oracle and VMWare software run the database.

But the harder the Yangs push, the harder the system pushes back.

In February 2023, they went to the National Public Complaints Administration in Beijing with a letter. Two days later, police grabbed them from their hotel and drove them home.

The Yangs persisted, trying to plead their case to Beijing. In the following months, they were seized at bus and train stations, beaten at a hospital and abducted by ambulance.

Last July, Yang’s mother tried again. She carried a letter for Chinese leader Xi Jinping:

“They’re using violence and kidnapping to bar me from petitioning and seeking medical treatment ... We beg you, General Secretary, to save us.”

Outside Beijing’s leadership compound, burly men in black tackled Yang’s mother to the ground. She was jailed for over a month, questioned, strip-searched, force-fed medication and deprived of food and water. In October, she and Yang’s sister disappeared.

The Yangs’ house is now the last left standing. The father lives alone.

His relatives have cut contact, unnerved by the flock of police that tail him. Thousands of pages of documents stashed in drawers, stuffed in bags, and piled in boxes in a bathtub chronicle every step of their 16-year quest for justice.

In April, Yang was sent criminal charges showing how much police had spent to stop the family’s “abnormal petitioning.”

The cost: About $37,000.

Kennedy Jr.

In announcing the switch, the 155-year-old company said it has used many colors derived from natural sources in the majority of its products for many years and that the move away from artificial dyes only affects a few products.

“Our commitment to making great food means we adapt to consumer needs and lead with innovation. People want simpler, recognizable ingredients — and we’re responding,” the company’s announcement says.

The artificial colors currently used in Campbell’s products are all allowable by the Food and Drug Administration and are on the agency’s Food, Drug and Cosmetics (FD&C) approved list. However, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Martin Makary earlier this year asked food companies to stop using several of the dyes that are FDA approved. Companies are responding with voluntary actions.

“We will no longer produce any of our food or beverages with FD&C colors. The transition means that Lance crackers and V8 Splash will use colors derived from natural sources, such as annatto and purple carrot juice concentrate. Our regional Snacks brands such as Jay’s, O-Ke-Doke and Tom’s and cookie brands like Archway and Stella D’oro will also no longer use FD&C colors,” Campbell’s said.

Campbell’s move to natural colors is set to begin sometime between March and August 2026. The existing products will be replaced “as inventory clears.”

“We’ve been actively reviewing our portfolio and tracking the evolving regulatory environment. People are increasingly seeking better-for-you options with simpler, recognizable ingredients. This move reflects both consumer preferences and our commitment to making great food,” Campbell’s said.

In its announcement, the company pointed out that it’s red Goldfish crackers have used colors sourced from plants for more than 15 years. The product is made with a mix of beet juice concentrate and paprika extracted from sweet red peppers. Beginning in 2026 annatto and purple carrots will be used to color products like Lance crackers and V8 splash.

Other companies that have responded to Kennedy’s suggestion include General Mills, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo, Danone North America, TreeHouse Foods, Conagra Brands, Nestlé USA and Tyson. The companies currently use artificial food dyes that have FDA approval, but are switching to natural dyes.

The FDA currently approves the use of Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Citrus Red and Orange B. All are petroleum based and are used in the production of highly processed foods. Kennedy has repeatedly said he wants to reduce the amount of processed food consumers eat — including those colored with artificial dyes — but has not said how he plans to do so.

In the quest to entice food companies to voluntarily stop using artificial dyes, FDA officials have given approval for some natural dyes that have previously been banned. The newest color is gardenia blue. It is extracted from the fruit of the gardenia, a flowering evergreen. The FDA has approved the color additive for use in sports drinks, flavored or enhanced non-carbonated water, fruit drinks and ades, ready-to-drink teas, hard candy and soft candy.

With the approval of the blue coloring, the FDA has now put four food dyes on the approved list. In May the agency gave the OK for three colors derived from natural sources. Those were: galdieria extract blue, a blue colorant derived from the unicellular red algae Galdieria sulphuraria; calcium phosphate, a white powder; and butterfly pea flower extract, a blue color that can be used to achieve a range of shades including bright blues, intense purple, and natural greens.",https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/104/442/937/ZwVbKlDe9Y8AvNJmz8moa3jPM/beb7dfe60b6586e60380c2c12e8ee9e45ea38b3a.png,N,,2025-09-09 01:06:57.757942

The laws were meant to close the ""Instacart loophole"" that allowed grocery delivery apps to pay workers less than their restaurant counterparts, even though the job is largely the same.
""When the apps more efficiently operate their business to bolster worker productivity, worker pay per hour more than triples, and earnings per hour nearly double.""
That's down from the 60 percent that the apps kept before minimum pay, but it's still significant.
[Minimum pay] hasn't threatened in any way the app delivery business model,"" said Parrot.","The city's first-of-its-kind ""deliverista"" minimum wage is working: previously underpaid gig-workers are taking home more money per hour and delivery app companies are getting more orders than ever.

New data from the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection shows an all-time high of $120.2 million in consumer spending in the first quarter of 2025 — up 13.4 percent from the same period last year. The data reporting was a requirement of the 2021 bill that created the deliverista minimum wage.

And the amount of orders has risen, too — up 4.2 percent over the past four quarters. Economists see this as a sign that minimum pay is not having a negative impact on business.

“Whatever has happened to worker pay has not diminished, literally, the appetite of consumers for food delivery,” said James Parrot, the director of economic and fiscal policies at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School, who consulted with the city on the original minimum pay law.

Instacart's last ditch efforts

In July, the City Council passed two bills that would expand the minimum pay standard from just restaurant delivery app workers to all contract gig workers in the five boroughs, including those working for grocery giant, Instacart. The laws were meant to close the ""Instacart loophole"" that allowed grocery delivery apps to pay workers less than their restaurant counterparts, even though the job is largely the same.

An all-out campaign against the bills worked on Mayor Adams, who vetoed the bills after originally supporting their intent. But Speaker Adrienne Adams has vowed to override the vetoes at the upcoming stated meeting on Sept. 10, and cited Streetsblog’s coverage in her decision.

Even so, Instacart continues to lobbying against the bills. In a new op-ed in Politics NY that closely mirrors a letter sent to Speaker Adams last week, Instacart’s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Dani Dudeck argued that “the cost of food deliveries surged 10 percent, tips fell by 68 percent, and fees on restaurants surged 13 percent” during the period covered by the city data.

Focusing on tips ignores the fact that workers are making significantly more money and are therefore less reliant on tips to supplement low wages.

""While tips-per-order fell, what's critical for workers is their total earnings per delivery and that increased by 21 percent,"" said Parrot. ""When the apps more efficiently operate their business to bolster worker productivity, worker pay per hour more than triples, and earnings per hour nearly double.""

The aggregated combined pay was at $21.11 per hour in the first quarter of this year. Before the minimum wage went into effect, that number was as low as $10.87, not including tips.

And highlighting consumer and restaurant fees misses the point, Parrot added.

""It is quite disingenuous for Instacart to say that restaurant fees 'surged' by 13 percent,"" said Parrot. ""The apps would have increased fees even more were it not for the fee cap, and the recent settlement will allow the apps to get their way so they can increase fees more.""

A recently passed Council bill, which was a part of the legal settlement around the minimum pay law, would lift the fee cap for restaurants, meaning the apps would be able to take a cut of up to 43 percent of each order.

The apps charge consumers and merchants a fee, which total $13.24 per order, of which the companies keep 40.5 percent or $5.36. That's down from the 60 percent that the apps kept before minimum pay, but it's still significant.

""It's hard to feel any empathy for the companies at all. They are still taking a huge share of these fees even when they're required to pay the workers. [Minimum pay] hasn't threatened in any way the app delivery business model,"" said Parrot. ""The app delivery experience shows that the apps had considerable leeway to reduce their take per order and Instacart will have that same leeway, probably more so since they are a much more dominant player in the grocery delivery business.""

Flexing flexibility

Instacart has also started recycling the same argument that restaurant apps used before the 2021 bill passed, mainly that a minimum pay rate would result in a decrease in “flexibility.”

“For these New Yorkers, the ability to earn money on their own time and their own terms is not just a preference — it is essential. It allows them to log on to work — and log off — at any moment they choose,” Dudek wrote.

But that's a specious argument; after the minimum wage went into effect, the average hours per worker remained pretty much unchanged.

“That doesn’t suggest any impingement of flexibility at all,” said Parrot. “With the seasonal rebound in orders, the number of workers increased in response to that. The labor force remains flexible in response to changes in consumer demand.”",https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/delivery-cyclists-deliveristas-with-money-0093.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 03:05:03.234311
