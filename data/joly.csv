The French tyre maker said that U.S.-imposed tariffs would add to volatility in the market, but its local-to-local strategy would prove valuable in dealing with them.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Michelin employs more than 23,500 people in its production sites across the U.S. and Canada. It has two plants in Mexico - Queretaro and Leon - and three in Canada - Pictou, Bridgewater and Waterville.

Analysis of the recent U.S. executive orders still require clarification and no conclusion can be drawn at this stage, Michelin's management said during the call.

The North American market, including Mexico, accounted for 38.6% of its total annual sales in 2024.

KEY QUOTES

""Finished products flows from other regions to the US could be impacted by the 25% tariff that applies to auto and auto parts, yet it is still to be confirmed whether all tires are falling under this tariff.""

""For Michelin, the main flows are Europe-to-US in Agricultural tires and Indonesia-to-US in Tier 2 Passenger car tires.""

""As regards retaliation tariffs from non-US countries, the story is just beginning. What we can say is that the USA is a low-exporting country for Michelin, therefore exports from US to Europe and Asia are very limited.""

""In the current highly volatile context, we will not develop any forward-looking view today, we will keep it for our Q1 sales release later in the month.""

BY THE NUMBERS

Michelin confirmed it expects volumes to drop between 6% and 8% in the first quarter, driven by lower car demand after the end of 2024.

Analysts on average were expecting it to report quarterly sales of 6.67 billion euros ($7.33 billion) and a volume drop of 2.6% in a company-provided consensus dated February 17.

Concerning U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, the group said that 70% of its tyres sold in the United States were manufactured in the country.

It also noted that natural rubber was not impacted by any of the recent announcements and that U.S. could be considered self-sufficient for the production of synthetic rubber.

Michelin will report first-quarter results on April 24.

The locals: Caribou Coffee Caribou was founded in 1992 by John and Kim Puckett in Minneapolis at 44th and France Avenue South (the location closed in 2023).
The locals: Dunn Brothers Coffee Dunn Brothers is a 38-year-old coffee shop business rooted in the Twin Cities.","If you’re under 50, you don’t remember when coffee in America was mostly swill that came from granules spooned into hot water. The term “coffee shop” referenced a daytime diner, a la Seinfeld, where people went for pancakes or a tuna sandwich, whose coffee rarely was something to write home about. But sometime in the 1980s, things started to change. Coffee became an artisanal good, like in Italy or France. Drinking Sanka or Folgers became a sign you were a yokel.

With this evolution came entrepreneurs, notably Starbucks, which picked up on the growing thirst and slaked it, and coffee became a feedback loop that brings us to today, where a small latte sells for $7.40 at a “third-wave” coffee shop.

The coffee cognoscenti describe its evolution in waves. The first was the coffeehouses of the beatniks (1950s-60s); the second was Starbucks and Caribou and the democratization and commercialization of good beans in the ’90s; the third wave was the barista-driven, latte art, specialty coffee era from 2000. Fourth-wave coffee involves a re-democratization of the third wave—coffee shops in the Australian style (friendly and unpretentious all-day cafes with third-wave coffee and a carefully chosen scratch food menu). There’s not much of it in the Twin Cities.

This evolution turned the old coffee shop into an industry category where Americans routinely spend $5-$15 to start their day. The business is full of paradoxes, as packed shops struggle to break even, new entrants emerge quarterly, and consumers decry the spiraling expense but seem powerless to resist it.

Locally Caribou is for sale, Rustica just sold, Dunn Brothers sold recently and wants to quintuple in size, while Starbucks is retrenching. Independents like FRGMT, Spyhouse, Backstory, and Café Ceres are routinely packed, but the latter shut down due to chronic unprofitability. And national drive-thru chains Scooter’s, 7 Brew, and Dutch Bros are eyeing us for expansion.

The business today runs the gamut from tiny one-offs to local chains to large regional and national players. The Twin Cities is not a market the nationals immediately look to, so we tend to see them later in their growth cycle.

The daily ritual

What’s unique about coffee is whereas most of us don’t crave pancakes or tuna salad every day, coffee isn’t optional. “Coffee is emotional,” explains Lee Wallace, owner and CEO of locally based Peace Coffee. “It’s a special daily ritual to people.” As a result, there’s opportunity. “McDonald’s breakfast business was up 20% just on upgrading its coffee,” says Jonathan Maze, editor-in-chief at Restaurant Business, a trade publication. “You can trace that to Starbucks.”

Wallace pinpoints it to about two decades ago, when coffee consumption broadly became “about excellence of coffee and ethical supply chains.”

And then there was the pandemic. “Coffee had a moment during Covid,” explains Erin Newkirk, chief brand and marketing officer for Brooklyn Center-based Caribou Coffee. “It was an essential business. It got you out of the house.” If you hadn’t cared about coffee shops before, now you did.

A good business?

Maze says the pandemic accelerated changes already underway, as second-wave shops spawned variations both downmarket and upmarket. Today the coffee shop business is both mass and small-scale, driven by convenience and an artisan mindset. A few bullet points define common denominators:

Work from home has remade the industry.

Workspaces are essential for the one-offs and small chains, as is a welcoming environment that encourages people to bring their work from home to the shop.

Gen Z customers increasingly want cold drinks and non-coffee products.

Specialty coffee is the growing segment. Sixty percent of Americans drank specialty coffee last year, says Wallace.

“All the growth [in coffee] is suburban,” says Maze. “We think of coffee as an urban phenomenon, but now it’s suburban.”

Light roast

Entrepreneurs and investors get into coffee for a variety of reasons, almost always because of their love of the drink, at least initially. But there are business imperatives as well. Daniel Del Prado, who operates some of Minneapolis’ most celebrated restaurants and operated the four-location coffee chain Cafe Ceres, explains, explains:

Coffee has less upfront investment. “You get a lot of tenant improvements [from a landlord]. A restaurant costs a minimum of a million dollars to build out, a basic coffee shop $100,000.” He says percentage of revenue or even free rent is common, making it easier to ride out slow months. “Landlords want [the coffee shop] as an amenity,” he says.

Coffee also promotes loyalty. “It’s a frequency business,” explains Newkirk. “It’s sticky,” adds Wallace. “Once people get into a place, it’s kind of like Cheers—the whole third-place idea.”

And optimally, it’s an appealing place to work. “We have positive, passionate customers, and that really inspires our team,” explains Michael Kollar, a Dunn Brothers franchisee with stores in the west metro.

Dark roast

Despite this, coffee has its downsides.

Del Prado shared some ominous metrics. Wages are up 50% from 2020 in all job categories. Plus, “butter, flour, coffee, milk all has gone up 50% or more in price,” he says. “I can’t charge what I should to make a profit.” He sells a latte for as much as $7.75 but says it should be $11 to generate acceptable margins. Given the absurdity of the situation, he says, “Coffee shops are money pits. I can’t imagine being in this business much longer.

“Coffee shops don’t produce cash flow,” he continues. “Five of them equal one restaurant, and it’s a more difficult worker base,” as he has come to learn.

And the margins are low—“they are low for anything in food,” notes Rustica owner Brent Frederick. “You do it because you love it.”

Rustica’s Lake Street location sits next to a Punch Pizza, which occupies less space but does roughly twice the revenue. “The dirty secret of coffee is it takes an incredible volume to be successful—a line out the door in the morning and busy inside all day,” explains Caribou founder John Puckett, who now is co-owner of Punch. “A store can look busy but not make money. We barely broke even on every college campus.”

Unions have organized various Starbucks around the country, as well as Café Ceres. Puckett theorizes that the intense demands of Starbucks’ volume during Covid uniquely stressed its worker base. But urban coffee shop workers also tend to seek more workplace control. Maze says virtually all unionized non-hotel restaurants are in coffee. But most of the locally based operators TCB talked to said they faced no current issues.

“Labor doesn’t scare us,” says Rustica’s Frederick. “Having a good culture, the right training, scheduling, and benefits helps.”

But the business faces layers of other pressures. Dunn Brothers’ Kollar cites regulatory fees, obligatory retirement plans, and the state’s new paid leave system. Wholesale coffee bean prices have quadrupled in five years due to increased global demand and climate-driven shortages—so retail pricing has risen relentlessly.

Though “we’ve not seen a lot of price sensitivity [among consumers] so far,” notes Peace Coffee’s Wallace, the company chose to get out of the coffee shop business during the pandemic. Wallace says her coffee made at home is roughly 60 cents a cup.

The role of the chew

Most people want food with their morning brew; it’s rare to find a coffee shop without at least a tray of pastries. But most go further, with an array of prepared egg sandwiches and lunchtime fare. For the big boys, it’s all frozen or pre-packaged, but many of the locals cook from scratch. That adds dynamics such as additional training, spoilage, and prep, plus the regulatory burdens that come with fresh food. But woe to the coffee shop that rolls without it.

“Beverages are the profit center,” says Maze. “You sell food to get the beverage sale.” That’s because people don’t want to go to multiple venues, says Caribou’s Newkirk. So “you add food, and you double your sales and add frequency,” says Ben Hertz, co-founder of defunct fourth-wave coffee chain Penny’s. “Come for a meeting, stay to do emails, and at 11:30 you’ll have a salad.”

But where to draw the line? Starbucks has decided its menu is unnecessarily large and is paring back. “The question for us was always how much complexity to add,” Wallace recalls. “Food, cold drinks, alcohol?”

Caribou founder Puckett would draw the line at anything requiring ice: “In my opinion, cold beverages have ruined the coffee business” because they don’t require a skilled barista and are often glorified milkshakes.

The national players

The coffee shop business divides most easily among companies that do business in multiple locations and those based in a single metro area.

Among the big players, smaller-format stores, often without seating but with drive-thru capabilities, are the growth business.

Starbucks is the largest operator of coffee shops in the country, with roughly 17,000 locations. It created the category, by and large, and continues to dominate it. But it is struggling. During the pandemic, with more drive-thrus and better digital capabilities, Starbucks “blew up,” as the kids say—its business exploded, and today it is reaping both the benefits and the drawbacks.

It’s not uncommon to go into a Starbucks and see more than a dozen drink and food items waiting for pickup, or to wait 10-15 minutes for an order in a store with barely any customers. The company also removed seating from stores during the pandemic and didn’t restore all of it. It opened shops designed only for pickup orders. Starbucks admits to hollowing out the hospitality side of the brand and has refocused around restoring that part of its business.

“Customer service data metrics show people don’t like Starbucks, which is driving part of their leadership’s desperation,” Maze explains. “Starbucks has been overwhelmed by mobile.” The company’s new leadership is adapting mobile capacities to control volume while charting a “back to the future” mantra, but “you make money churning customers,” says Maze, who notes that Starbucks hopes for an average of $2 million in revenue per store, which only a handful of the busiest coffee shops in the Twin Cities experience.

Starbucks “can’t turn off the demand that Covid created,” notes Puckett, who says he is watching its evolution closely. Starbucks entered the Twin Cities after Caribou’s 1992 founding—later than it did many metro areas—and we’re one of the few large metro markets the company doesn’t dominate.

The other notable category of national operator is the small-format drive-thru-only business model of 7 Brew, Scooter’s, and Dutch Bros, which are currently the talk of the industry. They are predominantly in suburbs and exurbs. (Scooter’s has a small number of Minnesota locations.)

“The idea of a coffee shop is changing,” says Maze.

The locals: Caribou Coffee

Caribou was founded in 1992 by John and Kim Puckett in Minneapolis at 44th and France Avenue South (the location closed in 2023). The Pucketts sold the company in 2000, it went public in 2005, and it was taken private by German food conglomerate JAB in 2012. (Caribou’s history is fascinating but too involved for this feature.) JAB transferred many of Caribou’s stores outside the Upper Midwest to its owned-brand Peet’s Coffee, and Caribou retrenched to the Upper Midwest and a few domestic pockets like Atlanta.

JAB more recently placed Caribou under the umbrella of its St. Louis-based Panera Brands group, along with Einstein Brothers and Bruegger’s Bagels. Last year, Panera announced it was exploring a sale of Caribou and the bagel properties. Caribou’s CEO, John Butcher, announced his departure this March.

Caribou still controls the largest number of coffee shops in the Twin Cities region, but outside observers are uncertain about its trajectory.

“I feel like they’re sort of ignored within JAB,” says Maze. “The parent is very focused on Panera, which is not doing well. I can’t see an obvious strategy to [JAB’s] ownership tenure other than ‘own brands and combine them.’ The Caribous they converted to Peet’s mostly closed.”

Caribou has evolved its strategy over the years. It had long licensed stores in grocery stores, hospitals, and airports, but in 2021 it began franchising stand-alone stores, which is driving current growth back into Michigan and Ohio, plus Florida. Company-owned store growth is in Wisconsin and the Southeast. (Over 40% of Caribou’s stores are franchised in the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, Turkey, and Bosnia, a legacy of the period before JAB ownership when the company’s largest shareholder was Arcapita, a Bahrain-based investment fund. There are arguably more standalone Caribous in Cairo and Riyadh than Minneapolis.)

Food service advisory firm Technomic Ignite ranks Caribou as the nation’s sixth-largest coffee shop by sales volume. At the end of 2024, it had 487 U.S. locations, 335 of them company-owned. In a franchise disclosure filed for FY23, Caribou said its company-owned full-service coffeehouses with drive-thru (1,500 square feet) averaged $1.08 million in sales, while the drive-thru-only cabin (600 square feet) averaged $806,000, making the economic advantages of the smaller format evident.

“My take is that the biggest factor behind Caribou’s slip in national market share has been the aggressive expansion of its competitors,” says Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research for Technomic Ignite. “Caribou is getting squeezed in both directions by the store growth of bigger players like Starbucks and Dunkin’ as well as the proliferation of smaller upstarts. For context, Starbucks opened over 500 U.S. stores just in the last year.” (Caribou added seven stores in 2024.)

Hertz, the founder of Penny’s, says he perceives Caribou as “gun-shy, risk-averse. They don’t innovate.”

Caribou would, of course, disagree with this characterization. But what’s notable about the company is that as its competitors retrench around coffee basics, Caribou sees itself as more of a coffee-themed hospitality business.

“Caribou is doing what we’ve always done, making people feel like they belong,” says Newkirk. “It doesn’t have to be coffee. Our focus is on where consumers are going.” She describes “meeting guests where they’re at,” with an emphasis on “optionality.”

“There’s the product and there’s the service, the emotional benefit, the gatherings, moments that happen,” Newkirk continues. “We’re there for all of that. … We stay on trend. There’s real lavender on our menu. We’re looking at botanicals, energy drinks that play off the coffee experience.”

Caribou’s founder still sees potential in the company. “I’m sorry to see John [Butcher] go,” says Puckett. “He’d attracted a good team, reinvigorated the culture. Any buyer would want to have him. I think Caribou is still a good business for the right buyer.”

The locals: Dunn Brothers Coffee

Dunn Brothers is a 38-year-old coffee shop business rooted in the Twin Cities. Lacking jazzy branding or an identifiable design signature, Dunn Brothers has always been about the coffee. It roasts its beans in-store, and they are brewed within five days. Its food menu is limited, but the eggs are cracked and the bread sliced right there, compared to the frozen product reheated by the big guys.

Dunn is a franchisor of coffee shops, with only four owned stores. Most stores are in Minnesota, but it also operates in the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Texas. It was sold in 2022 to Gala Capital, a private equity firm based in Orange County, California. Dunn currently franchises 43 stores, down from 54 in 2019. Its 2023 franchise disclosure identified 28 optimized Dunn Bros. with drive-thrus and full menus that averaged $576,000 in revenue, with the best-performing earning just over $1 million.

The company is in the midst of an evolution, says vice president of marketing Alexis Gillette. “Coffee is at our core, but post-Covid we’re rethinking our core. We’re looking at different store formats and footprints, working to grow and create consistency. We’re here to help budding entrepreneurs grow businesses.”

“Quality of coffee is our differentiator,” says west metro franchisee Michael Kollar. “I roast the beans, and our customers give us feedback [on the roast] because they are passionate about coffee.” Kollar’s operation is unorthodox in that he takes less profit and pays staff more because it’s a retirement project for him—but he insists his coffee shops are viable stand-alone businesses: “If my kids wanted to take over my stores,” he says, “they’d live a nice life.”

The locals: The little guys

The Twin Cities is rich in artisanal coffee shops. From Rustica to Spyhouse to Dogwood, they blanket Minneapolis and St. Paul. “The small chains drive the sector forward, like upscale indie restaurants do,” says Maze. “They try new things that filter down. The chains watch them for ideas that work.”

But they may or may not be good businesses.Local restaurant operator Jester Concepts (Parlour, P.S. Steak) recently bought two-unit coffee shop Rustica and announced plans for a third in a defunct Wayzata Wuollet bakery. Jester CEO Brent Frederick says his company, which mostly operates upscale restaurants, got into coffee strategically.

“The bakery drove a lot of it,” and partner Mike DeCamp loves coffee, Frederick says. “On our bakery side, we saw an opportunity for efficiencies and fun integrations with our restaurants.” Jester also found itself overinvested in the inner city after Covid and sees coffee as an antidote. “There’s a path to growth in the suburbs,” says Frederick. “The pandemic exposed us; everything reoriented to the suburbs. Meetings kept happening, but not downtown. We see opportunities in existing coffee shops, such as Wuollet’s awful situation.” (It has been shedding locations due to financial distress.)

It’s worth noting that Rustica once had a million-dollar wholesale bakery business, so at its core, it’s more of a bakery than most coffee shops. Frederick says he hopes to generate at least $1 million in revenue per store.

Del Prado hoped his restaurant chops would deliver a value-add in coffee. When he created Café Ceres, he wanted to grow to 12 units. “It’s an easy business to scale because of low overhead,” he says—assuming you don’t build full-service kitchens (as in the former Penny’s stores he took over). Del Prado and partner Shawn McKenzie lost interest after the shops unionized and the economics of coffee deteriorated.

Though his stores are crowded and lively, he says they don’t break even, whereas his restaurants in the same trade areas do. It’s hard to understand how an operator like Michael Kollar can hit it out of the park in Hopkins and Savage, yet Del Prado can’t in affluent southwest Minneapolis, but that’s the conundrum of coffee.

Percolating…

If you’re wondering where the business is heading, the words one hears most are “automation” and “off-premise.” “Every coffee business is moving toward automation,” says Del Prado. “There are affordable espresso machines today that grind, steam, and do latte art.”

Jonathan Maze adds that “off-premise is the present and future of coffee. The economics of it are compelling.” Chain coffee either wants you to consume in the car or believes you want to.

Both phenomena push the business toward less rent and labor, not to mention mechanized consistency. But the idea of that “third place”—which, in a work-from-home America, so many people seem to crave—seems only a growth engine of Starbucks and the small urban chains.

“It’s funny,” Maze says. “Everyone says they like the idea of that type of coffee shop, it’s just that more and more they are choosing something else.”",https://d5c1j5k5drfk7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/coffee-header.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 04:02:20.799066

Vietnam, China and Indonesia – all hard-hit by Trump tariffs – account for 95 per cent of Nike footwear production.
All eyes, then, are on Vietnam – Nike’s most important production base.
Betting on Vietnam Nike entered Vietnam in 1995 with five contract footwear factories, part of a long-term bet by co-founder Phil Knight.
He offered to cut tariffs on US goods to zero and encouraged Mr Trump to do the same.","- At Nike headquarters in Oregon, US, executives are trying to figure out how to best spread the pain of new tariffs.

Nike, the factories that produce its goods, the wholesalers that sell the goods and ultimately shoppers will all likely share portions of the cost, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The backbone of Nike’s supply chain is being threatened by US President Donald Trump’s global tariff campaign, straining a decades-long investment just as the world’s largest sneaker company tries to rebound under a new chief executive.

Over the past 30 years, Nike has funnelled billions of dollars of production into Vietnam, helping turn the South-east Asian nation into a powerhouse for footwear and apparel production. On April 9, Mr Trump imposed a 46 per cent tariff on goods from Vietnam – among the steepest of the countries he targeted – that threatens to devastate its manufacturing industries.

The announcement was then thrown into limbo hours later when Mr Trump said he would pause higher tariffs on dozens of non-retaliating countries for 90 days. Nike shares rose 7.2 per cent at 1.30pm in New York after the President posted about the pause on social media.

Nike has become a symbol of corporate fallout from Mr Trump’s tariff blitz: A famed US brand entangled in an economic calamity that has wiped trillions from stocks and pushed global supply chains into disarray. Executives have been left with a costly conundrum across Asia, where nearly all Nike sneakers are made.

The timing could not be worse. New CEO Elliott Hill is attempting to revive a company weighed down by slumping sales and corporate layoffs. Nike expects further declines in revenue and profitability, and shares have fallen 30 per cent so far in 2025.

Mr Hill must now navigate rising costs across his supply chain, with the possibility of passing price hikes on to consumers.

In March, he told investors that he visited factory partners in Asia “to see how we’re executing”, but has yet to outline a plan to manage tariff fallout.

Management’s options are limited, and analysts say it is impossible for Nike to quickly reorient its supply chain.

Vietnam, China and Indonesia – all hard-hit by Trump tariffs – account for 95 per cent of Nike footwear production.

The total workforce that manufactures Nike products in those three countries is roughly 850,000 – slightly larger than Apple supplier Foxconn, according to company disclosures.

TD Cowen analyst John Kernan said there is simply nowhere else with the comparable capacity or labour costs to absorb that volume.

All eyes, then, are on Vietnam – Nike’s most important production base.

Betting on Vietnam

Nike entered Vietnam in 1995 with five contract footwear factories, part of a long-term bet by co-founder Phil Knight. It was a gamble because the industry was still developing, and its workforce lacked experience and oversight, but Mr Knight saw opportunity.

Since then, Nike’s footprint in Vietnam has only increased, adding more factories as the industry gained infrastructure and manufacturing experience.

Rivals like Adidas and Puma followed, as did newer brands such as Lululemon Athletica, Skechers USA and Allbirds.

Half of all Nike brand sneakers are made in Vietnam now, according to filings.

Vietnam’s footwear and apparel industries were big winners during Mr Trump’s first term.

Geopolitical tensions pushed Western brands out of China, and they flocked to Vietnam, with its established manufacturing history and infrastructure.

Vietnam now ranks among the world’s top exporters of both apparel and footwear, according to the World Bank.

Vietnam’s government has lauded Nike’s investments as vital to their economy’s growth.

The nation has been among Asia’s fastest-growing economies in recent years, with gross domestic product up 7.1 per cent in 2024.

That mutual dependence has led to a close relationship between Nike and Vietnam’s government.

Officials in Hanoi have hosted Nike executive in recent years.

In 2022, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh asked the company for policy recommendations to deepen Vietnam’s integration into global supply chains.

Limited options

These days, Nike works with more than 100 apparel factories, footwear plants and equipment makers in Vietnam, the company has disclosed.

Most are clustered around Ho Chi Minh City, where major contractors each employ over 10,000 workers.

Nike could pressure vendors to take on more of the new costs, streamline operations or coordinate with retail partners to raise prices, said Ms Anna Andreeva, an analyst at Piper Sandler.

But she warned that there is a ceiling.

“That’s the number one question: How much price increase can the consumer realistically absorb?” Ms Andreeva said.

Executives at Foot Locker, Nike’s biggest retail partner, said last week that they are in “constant communications” with brands on pricing strategy as they mull over how much of these tariff costs will end up being placed on US shoppers.

“We’re going to work through brand by brand,” Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon said at a JPMorgan event last week. “It’s a combination of ‘What do they take? What does the consumer take?’”

Meanwhile, Vietnam’s government has been working to placate Mr Trump.

On April 5, Vietnam’s leader To Lam asked Mr Trump to delay his tariffs for at least 45 days to allow for negotiations.

He offered to cut tariffs on US goods to zero and encouraged Mr Trump to do the same.

Mr Trump said the call was “very productive”.

But White House adviser Peter Navarro said Vietnam’s offer was not enough.

Vietnam upped the offer on April 8, promising to buy more US defence and security products. BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a471f89ae9fc7486b2eb6e5668b0f5d8dd039a57555a3e9ba8f4e44404acbee3,N,,2025-04-10 01:59:59.527806

The facility only operates during the daytime, supported by the 25MW solar energy farm and 13.4MW of battery storage capacity.
Instead, we are promoting a stable and conducive environment, rich in the resources needed for cost-effective hydrogen production.
Net-zero industrial manufacturing of iron is, already today, economically competitive.” The most energy-intensive part of iron production is the reduction process, in which iron ore is reduced, losing its oxygen content.","In a world hungry for sustainable solutions, Namibia’s HyIron has fired up a game-changer — producing “green hydrogen” and using it to refine iron ore. The Oshivela pilot project, near Arandis in the Erongo region, is not only a first for Namibia but a world first in carbon-free iron production.

With a solar-powered facility and cutting-edge hydrogen technology, HyIron is setting the stage for a revolution in the steel industry. The project is the first on the planet to use green hydrogen for processing iron oxide to produce direct reduced iron ore (DRI), a crucial component in sustainable steel production.

The Oshivela project on the Bloemhof farm is supported by €13m from the German federal ministry for economic affairs & climate action. HyIron is a consortium of German companies with a Namibian partner, HyIron Green Technologies.

Construction of the facility began in 2024. Within six months, HyIron had successfully installed 44,000 solar panels across 25ha, capable of generating 25MW of renewable energy. The facility only operates during the daytime, supported by the 25MW solar energy farm and 13.4MW of battery storage capacity.

GEiSt (German for “green iron for the steel industry”) has piloted the technology in Lingen, Germany, in co-operation with RWE (a multinational energy company) and Benteler (a German steel company).

The Oshivela project uses the technology on an industrial scale. With an initial production capacity of 15,000t annually, the plant demonstrates that large-scale production of green iron is technically achievable and can be economically viable.

The modular construction model enables easy scalability in future production.

“The primary aim of the pilot plant,” says HyIron’s Namibian CEO and co-founder Johannes Michels, “is to enhance the process and evaluate different iron ores while refining the products used across the value chain. Its peak production capability is 5,000kg an hour.

The company intends to increase production to 25,000kg an hour by the end of 2027, while extending the production period to 24/7. It is initiating a comparable project in Australia, and is also evaluating opportunities in Angola and Brazil, along with up to four more sites in Namibia.

The company’s Oshivela plant produces hydrogen using a 12MW electrolyser unit supplied by China’s Peric Hydrogen Systems. The electrolyser, which generates green hydrogen, is the largest of its kind in Southern Africa. It operates within a smart microgrid, “which means there is no grid connection and the production is aligned with the available stored or generated renewable energy,” Michels says.

The plant, powered entirely by solar energy, is expected to begin production of DRI by mid-April. It aims for an initial output of 15,000t a year, targeting 2Mt by 2030.

HyIron-Oshivela has secured its first offtake agreement to supply a large part of its first-stage production to German steelmaker Benteler, which has the option to also buy part of the phase 2 product.

The initial phase required an investment of €30m, of which more than 40% took the form of grants from the German government. The rest was mustered through private investment from the company’s founders.

HyIron expects to begin the second phase of development at the end of this year. This phase aims to greatly enhance solar power capacity and will need an investment of €230m. “The funds for this will come from equity investors and debt funders,” says Michels.

The third phase is expected to start in 2027 and aims to boost capacity by a factor of 10 once more. This will need additional investment of €2.3bn. By 2030, HyIron aims to produce 2Mt of DRI per year.

“HyIron’s DRI manufacturing method is completely free of carbon emissions since it uses hydrogen as its energy source. The water used in this process is endlessly recycled, ensuring that no water sources are being exhausted,” Michels says.

James Mnyupe, Namibia’s green hydrogen commissioner, says this is a significant milestone. “While Namibia has significant natural capacity to produce hydrogen at a low cost, the government is not solely focused on marketing hydrogen itself. Instead, we are promoting a stable and conducive environment, rich in the resources needed for cost-effective hydrogen production.

“We aim to establish sectoral legislation and a favourable fiscal framework that will enable the use of hydrogen for industrialisation in Namibia. This will allow us to produce a variety of goods with low-carbon content for international trade.

“Therefore, our focus is not just on hydrogen production but on the development of sustainable industries in Namibia. And HyIron is a case in point.”

Central to this project is HyIron technology, an innovative process to reduce iron ore in a rotary kiln with the help of green hydrogen. It is therefore entirely carbon neutral.

Says Michels: “Every ton of iron produced this way replaces 1.8t of carbon dioxide in the traditional process. Net-zero industrial manufacturing of iron is, already today, economically competitive.”

The most energy-intensive part of iron production is the reduction process, in which iron ore is reduced, losing its oxygen content. Every year, about 1.9-billion tons of iron are produced globally. Two-thirds of that comes from primary production, the extraction of iron ore, and one-third is from recycled materials.

Iron production now relies entirely on fossil fuels. As a result, the iron industry accounts for about 8% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, making it one of the most significant drivers of climate change. The demand for iron is projected to increase to 2.2-billion tons per year by 2030, implying an annual increase of 50Mt.

Michels explains the technical process underlying production: “Iron ore is an oxide that needs to be reduced by separating it from its oxygen content before it is further manufactured into steel or cast iron. For this process, a reduction agent is required which draws the oxygen from the iron ore.

“Fossil fuels such as coking coals are the most commonly used reduction agents. At HyIron, we replace these with green hydrogen to produce DRI, which is then turned into hot or cold briquetted iron — all of this with zero emissions.”

The product can then be used directly in foundries or steel factories to find its way into daily life as steel or cast iron.

Of course, for solar power to be economically viable, such plants need to be guaranteed extended periods of sunshine. According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency, solar photovoltaic systems in Namibia can generate twice as much electricity as comparable systems in central Europe.

The opportunities for the exploitation of solar power are also available for South Africa, acknowledged to be one of the most sun-rich countries in the world.

According to the World Data Centre for Meteorology, the sunniest place in the world from November to February is the Upington district in the Northern Cape , with a peak of 367 hours a month and an average of nearly 12 hours a day. Over a full 12 months, Keetmanshoop in Namibia is globally the sixth most sunny location (after Yuma and Phoenix in Arizona, two towns in Egypt and one in Chile).",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dv3HOFSOZv9yKbx_Ibie_XPISWRQ2FiLnT27cXT_gLuaJVIBGH7PN-ZqqtzkZAw9SZYHKDXcg2ir63r51QHosLaYOXl5iu61iqHynn4f2XH0=s1000,N,,2025-04-10 00:00:22.275800

The breach was discovered on February 11, 2025, when Microsoft’s security team alerted the OCC about unusual activities on its network.

The hackers had infiltrated an administrator’s account, allowing them to spy on employee communications, including those of senior deputy comptrollers and international banking supervisors.

According to a draft letter to Congress reviewed by Bloomberg News, this unauthorized access extended from June 2023 until the breach was detected and the affected accounts were disabled.

The OCC, an independent bureau within the U.S. Treasury Department, oversees national banks, federal savings associations, and foreign banks’ federal branches and agencies, which collectively manage trillions in assets.

Critical Information in Compromised Emails

The compromised emails contained critical information regarding these institutions’ financial status, potentially leading to a significant decline in public trust, as noted by OCC Chief Information Officer Kristen Baldwin in the draft letter to Congress.

This incident adds to high-profile cyber breaches targeting U.S. government entities. In December 2024, the Treasury Department disclosed that Chinese state-sponsored hackers had accessed their network through a third-party vendor, viewing unclassified documents and gaining access to former Secretary Janet Yellen’s computer.

Although it remains unclear if the OCC breach is connected to these incidents, a Bloomberg report reveals the pattern of state-sponsored cyber espionage targeting U.S. financial institutions.

The OCC has labeled this breach a “major information security incident” and has taken immediate steps to assess its full scope, engaging external cybersecurity specialists for a comprehensive review of its IT security protocols.

Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood emphasized the need for accountability and the addressing of organizational weaknesses that contributed to this event.

Such breaches have profound implications for the security of financial data and the integrity of the national banking system.

The OCC’s role in ensuring compliance with laws and regulations and its power to enforce actions against banks underscore the critical nature of this breach.

As the investigation continues, the OCC is reviewing its cybersecurity measures to prevent future incidents. This highlights the ongoing challenge of securing sensitive government and financial data against sophisticated cyber threats.

In the broader context of the global trade war with China, tariffs are having a profound impact on the travel industry. When goods become more expensive to import, it leads to higher costs across the board. This extends to the cruise industry, – Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Celebrity Cruises, MSC Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Cunard Line, Oceania Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Crystal Cruises, Azamara, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, P&O Cruises, American Cruise Lines, Windstar Cruises, Saga Cruises, which relies heavily on international goods and services for its operations. As costs increase for cruise lines, consumers may see higher prices for their vacations. This may impact travel trends, as more budget-conscious travelers may rethink spending on expensive cruises. Additionally, the uncertainty created by the tariffs could make travelers hesitant, preferring to hold off on booking large trips until the future of U.S.-China trade relations becomes clearer.

U.S. Retail Imports and Global Trade War with China: The Far-Reaching Impacts

The escalating global trade war between the U.S. and China, exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff policies, has been causing widespread disruption. Retail imports into the U.S. are feeling the brunt of these economic shifts. With tariffs climbing to staggering levels, particularly on Chinese goods, U.S. retailers are seeing a decline in the flow of products, forcing many to reduce their inventory or delay new imports. According to trade experts, U.S. cargo volumes from the cruises, Matson Navigation Company, Crowley Maritime Corporation, American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier (ARC), SeaLand, TOTE Maritime, Liberty Global Logistics, Horizon Lines, APL (American President Lines), Maersk Line, Hapag-Lloyd, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Wallenius Wilhelmsen, NYK Line, Grimaldi Group, K Line, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) could see a dramatic drop of 20% in 2025. Retailers, once reliant on Chinese imports, are now scrambling to adjust, and the uncertainty has left them unable to forecast sales accurately.

This decline in imports is not limited to the retail sector; it impacts multiple industries across the U.S., including travel. The global travel sector, including airlines and cruises, relies on the smooth operation of trade routes to maintain competitive pricing on goods and services. As the cost of doing business rises, consumers may turn away from discretionary spending like international travel, cruises, and luxury getaways. The travel sector, in particular, faces a tough road ahead with these higher costs, making it even more challenging to attract the budget-conscious traveler.

How Tariffs Are Transforming the Cruise Sector

The cruise sector is being uniquely affected by the U.S.-China trade war and rising tariffs. Cruise lines are no strangers to the challenges posed by the global economy. From fuel price fluctuations to labor costs, cruise companies must navigate a complex set of external factors. However, with the latest round of tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports, the cruise industry and the cruise lines, Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Celebrity Cruises, MSC Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Cunard Line, Oceania Cruises, Viking Ocean Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Crystal Cruises, Azamara, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, P&O Cruises, American Cruise Lines, Windstar Cruises, Saga Cruises faces higher costs for goods sourced internationally, from ship-building materials to luxury items for passengers.

As operational costs increase, cruise lines are faced with the possibility of raising prices, which could push travelers to consider alternative vacation options. In particular, Chinese tourists, who have become a vital segment for the cruise industry, could see a reduction in their ability to travel due to the increased cost of Chinese-made products and higher cruise prices. With China’s own retaliatory tariffs impacting the U.S. economy, both Chinese outbound tourism and U.S. tourism to China could see declines, further disrupting cruise line revenues.

Moreover, as the trade war persists, global uncertainty continues to mount. Consumers may hesitate to book cruises if they feel uncertain about the economy or their financial future. Cruise lines could respond by offering more flexible booking policies and discounts to encourage travelers to lock in vacations despite the volatility. This period of unpredictability could also push cruise lines to rethink their international operations, possibly reducing reliance on certain markets in favor of more stable ones.

The latest Global Port Tracker report, released by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Hackett Associates, paints a dire forecast for U.S. imports in the coming months, as sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration begin to take their toll. The report predicts a dramatic reduction in cargo arriving at the nation’s major container ports, with a potential drop of 20% year-over-year in imports by the second half of 2025.

Retailers, who have been bringing in goods at an accelerated pace in recent months to stockpile inventory ahead of tariff hikes, are now facing a precarious future. With the imposition of the “reciprocal” tariffs—ranging as high as 50% on several key U.S. trading partners—retailers are expected to scale back their import activities significantly. According to Jonathan Gold, Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the NRF, the uncertainty surrounding these tariffs has created anxiety across American businesses, which are now reluctant to make further imports due to unpredictable changes in policy.

Trump’s Unprecedented Tariff Actions on U.S. Trading Partners

The ongoing U.S. trade war has reached new heights with President Donald Trump’s recent decision to impose a 10% tariff on all U.S. trading partners, along with reciprocal tariffs as high as 50%. This move follows earlier tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico and represents an escalation of the already volatile trade climate. In addition to the base tariffs, Trump introduced a national emergency tariff, pushing the total duties on China up to a staggering 104%, a move that has caused significant disruption within the global trade network.

As the tariffs continue to spiral upwards, businesses across sectors are grappling with higher costs and uncertainties about future trade relationships. Retailers, in particular, are feeling the pressure, as the goods they import are now subject to steep tariffs, further driving up costs and narrowing profit margins.

Retailers Brace for Slowdown and Inventory Rebalancing

Retailers have been stockpiling merchandise in anticipation of these tariff hikes, but the window for making preemptive imports has now closed. Gold notes that the 90-day pause that President Trump announced on tariffs for over 75 countries is expected to offer some relief, but it will not fully offset the negative effects on the retail sector. As a result, retailers are expected to rely on their existing inventories to meet consumer demand, at least for the next few months.

However, the long-term effects of this trade war are far from clear. Hackett Associates founder, Ben Hackett, expressed concerns that if the tariffs remain in place, imports could decline by 20% or more in the second half of 2025, potentially dragging overall cargo volume down by 15% year-over-year. The dramatic drop in imports is poised to affect both U.S. retailers and their international suppliers, leading to disruptions in the flow of goods.

The 90-Day Tariff Pause: A Strategic Reversal or Temporary Relief?

In a surprise twist, Trump took to social media to announce a 90-day pause on the latest tariff hikes for 75 countries. This decision comes after a surge of calls from global trading partners, including representatives from the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), who are seeking to negotiate a solution to ongoing trade disputes. Trump’s move has been interpreted as an attempt to ease tensions with key allies and give both sides time to find common ground.

While the 90-day pause may offer temporary relief, it is far from a permanent solution. Trump’s announcement still leaves the door open for further tariffs and trade disputes, with the possibility of higher duties being reintroduced after the pause period. For U.S. importers, this creates further uncertainty, as they will need to navigate the shifting landscape of international trade in the coming months.

The Growing Economic Fallout: What’s at Stake for U.S. Industries?

The ripple effects of Trump’s escalating tariffs are already being felt across several industries. Retailers face rising costs, which could lead to higher prices for consumers. The technology sector is particularly vulnerable, as many tech products are manufactured overseas and subject to tariffs, raising production costs and potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. The automotive industry is also impacted, with tariffs on steel, aluminum, and auto parts driving up manufacturing expenses.

The shipping and logistics industries are equally affected by these tariff increases, as rising costs and uncertainty in trade volumes create operational challenges. U.S. ports, especially major container hubs, are likely to see slower growth or even declines in cargo volumes, as businesses cut back on imports and adjust their strategies to deal with the rising tariffs.

Impacts on Container Ports and Global Shipping

Major U.S. container ports are bracing for a slowdown in imports, as retailers pull back on purchases and rely on their existing stockpiles. Hackett’s forecast indicates that U.S. cargo volume could see a net decline of 15% or more in 2025, driven by the combined effects of escalating tariffs and the broader global trade slowdown. Ports, particularly those on the West Coast, which handle a significant portion of U.S.-China trade, are expected to experience dramatic drops in throughput as companies look to cut costs and delay shipments.

The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy is likely to discourage investment in the global shipping industry, as companies and governments struggle to plan for the future. For now, the situation remains fluid, with the possibility of further changes in tariff rates, trade agreements, and shipping routes.

What Lies Ahead: More Uncertainty or a Path to Resolution?

The situation remains in flux, with President Trump’s 90-day pause offering a temporary respite but not a definitive solution to the ongoing trade war. With China continuing to retaliate with tariffs of its own, and many U.S. trading partners still wary of Trump’s aggressive trade tactics, the global economy is left to grapple with the effects of this escalating conflict.

For now, retailers and businesses across the U.S. and abroad will be forced to adjust to the new reality of higher tariffs and uncertain trade relations. The coming months will be critical in determining whether these trade tensions will ease or intensify, as both the U.S. and its global trading partners navigate a rapidly changing economic landscape. One thing is certain: uncertainty will continue to reign, and businesses must be prepared for the ongoing turbulence in global trade.

Bell argues that Starlink’s flat-rate pricing structure, which offers the same pricing model nationwide demonstrates its ability to operate sustainably without additional financial assistance to serve areas such as the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The company contends that subsidies would be better directed toward providers building and maintaining physical infrastructure in the North, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.

Starlink, which was approved to operate in Canada in 2022, has become a widely used option in rural and remote areas, offering high-speed internet via low-Earth orbit satellites. The service is particularly popular in communities where fibre-optic networks are not available. According to the company, it had over 400,000 active subscribers in Canada as of June 2024.

SpaceX disagrees with Bell’s position, stating that excluding Starlink from eligibility would limit consumer choice and potentially increase costs for residents in remote regions. The company has previously faced similar challenges in other jurisdictions — in the United States, a $900 million rural broadband subsidy was withdrawn in 2021 after concerns were raised about cost and performance.

The CRTC opened a public consultation on the subsidy program earlier this year and has said it will make a final decision based on the submissions received. In a January statement, the commission acknowledged that subsidies could help make internet services “more reliable and affordable” in the Far North, where the digital divide remains a persistent issue.

The federal government has entered into several contracts with SpaceX in recent years, including a $2.26 million agreement for Shared Services Canada and another valued at $414,000 for the Innovation, Science and Economic Development agency.

Analysts have warned of rising anti-American sentiment that could hit US brands hard, possibly leading to steeper prices at popular spots like McDonald's. Despite the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) shielding many food imports from tariffs, concerns loom large for companies like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Domino's.

BTIG analyst Peter Saleh expressed to Yahoo Finance his concern over customer backlash in international markets, which could significantly harm American brands. ""The bigger issue, in my mind, is the anti-American pushback in these countries on Western or US brands... we'll see... what companies say when they start reporting in the next couple of weeks if they're starting to see that already.""

Goldman Sachs predicts foreign boycotts could shave off 0.1% to 0.3% from US GDP this year, translating to a $28 billion to $83 billion loss. The tariffs' effect on consumer spending is another source of anxiety for analysts.

UBS analyst Dennis Geiger shared his insights in a note to clients on Monday, stating, ""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.""

This comes as fast food businesses are just beginning to recover from the impacts of the covid pandemic. McDonald's global same-store sales saw a slight increase of 0.4% last quarter, defying Wall Street's expectations of a 0.91% decrease. However, its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, due to an E. coli outbreak in late October.

The brand's international stores experienced positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, along with growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China. Last month, it was revealed that McDonalds had been dethroned as the largest restaurant chain in the world by Chinese bubble tea and ice cream chain Mixue Bingcheng.

The bubble tea chain boasts more than 45,000 restaurants worldwide as of September 2024, while McDonald's maintains around 41,800 locations globally, according to Statista via Chowhound. Meanwhile, coffee behemoth Starbucks is still striving for a rebound in its international business.

The U.S. has also reportedly withdrawn its delegation from the talks, effective Wednesday.

The response is in line with the administration's combative rhetoric towards carbon regulations and other international agreements, but it is a stark departure from the neutral tone that U.S. negotiators previously maintained. It is unclear whether senior White House leadership was involved in formulating the more accommodating U.S. negotiating position that American representatives projected in the runup to this week's MEPC meeting in London, which ends Friday.

""Should such a blatantly unfair measure go forward, our government will consider reciprocal measures so as to offset any fees charged to U.S. ships and compensate the American people for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures,"" the White House wrote in a last-minute warning to other national delegations. ""We must be clear the U.S. rejects any and all efforts to impose economic measures against its ships based on GHG emissions or fuel choice.""

Any participation in a tax on shipping's GHG emissions - the first global carbon levy of any kind - would have been in deep conflict with White House policy on climate change. President Donald Trump campaigned against climate action and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement on the first day of his second term, and he has promoted the production and use of all fossil fuels - including the renewed use of coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel.

An IMO bunker levy would also boost shipbuilding activity in East Asia, which would undercut White House policy goals. The Trump administration wants to reduce the power of Chinese shipyards, which lead the market and would stand to benefit from any IMO incentives for green retrofits and newbuilds. China's state-owned CSSC is the world's largest commercial shipbuilder, and any additional merchant vessel orders would cross-subsidize its warship deliveries for the PLA Navy, the U.S. Navy's pacing threat.

Some environmental advocates have suggested that action at MEPC is still possible, despite U.S. threats of retaliation (and rumored opposition from certain oil-producing member states).

""Let’s not get dazzled by the drama — this isn’t the United States of Shipping,"" Seas at Risk shipping policy officer Anais Rios told Politico.

This year, the tournament will take place in Oceanside, California and run from October 28 to November 2, the companies said.

Teams of athletes representing “Team Americas” and “Team World” will compete in tournament events, including basketball, gymnastics, tennis, volleyball and combat sports. The tournament will broadcast on Ion, the multicast channel acquired by Scripps five years ago. Ion is available on free streaming platforms and on broadcast and cable TV.

“The SI Women’s Games are a groundbreaking opportunity to do what we have always done at Sports Illustrated,” Steve Cannella, the Editor-in-Chief of Sports Illustrated, said in a statement on Wednesday. “This is an exciting new way for us to tell the best stories in sports. We can’t wait to watch these incredible athletes compete in California and celebrate everything they do, both on and off the field.”

“We’re proud to partner with Sports Illustrated, one of the most iconic brands in sports, to showcase and bring the compelling and exciting stories, athletes and events of the SI Women’s Games to every American household,” said Brian Lawlor, president of Scripps Sports. “This is another milestone for Scripps Sports and Ion as a premier destination for the best in women’s sports.”

Additionally, Scripps Sports is teaming up with Intersport to bring the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off to broadcast and streaming TV. The tournament formed in 2022, and has established itself as a premier earl season tournament for college-level sports.

The first broadcast will take place on Ion during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend (November 28-29), and will be held at Suncoast Credit Union Arena in Fort Myers, Florida.

“As the popularity of women’s sports among audiences and advertisers continues to explode, the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off will immediately become another major sports property for Ion,” Lawlor said. “We’re proud that women’s sports have found a home on Ion, and we look forward to bringing fans the action-packed world of women’s college basketball this fall.”

“Scripps Sports and Ion are now a top destination for women’s sports, and we’re thrilled to partner with them for the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off,” said Mark Starsiak, the Senior Vice President of Intersport. “This tournament has proven to be an exciting one for college basketball fans everywhere, and the Scripps Sports team will elevate this event even further.”

Live sports rights are becoming a bigger part of Scripps’ business model as the company seeks to attract and retain viewers and advertisers alike.

For broadcasters, live athletic competitions are “appointment-viewing events,” one where the best experience for the viewer is to watch a game as it happens in real-time, compared to scripted TV series and films, which can be watched and enjoyed on-demand.

Live sports also attracts advertisers because those types of TV events are unlikely to result in a viewer switching across channels or services, or finding other ways to avoid commercial spots.

At its Upfront event Wednesday evening, Scripps touted the prominence of live college and professional sports on its local and national channels as part of a broader strategy to deliver appointment-viewing programs of interest that can reach the broadest audience possible.

In addition to the two tournaments announced on Wednesday, Scripps also had the rights to Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) games for Ion, and some of its local stations have regional broadcast agreements for NBA and National Hockey League (NHL) games.

But, is anyone watching?

HB 1150 would make Arkansas the first state in the country to prohibit PBMs from holding pharmacy licenses.","Arkansas lawmakers in the Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would stop pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies and selling drugs retail in the state. The bill now heads to the governor's desk for her signature.

PBMs are the middlemen who negotiate with insurance companies, manufacturers, and pharmacies to set drug prices. Where the controversy comes in is when PBMs also own their own pharmacies, creating what many believe is a conflict of interest.

Arkansas is leading the charge in regulating PBMs, which the are inflating drug costs and squeezing local pharmacies that aren't affiliated with them.

Federal and state officials and pharmacists alike have criticized the practices of healthcare companies like CVS, which owns their own insurance company, Aetna, their own pharmacies, as well as pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark.

PBMs serve pharmacies, including those outside their ownership, by setting reimbursement rates for drugs sold through health insurance plans. Pharmacists have accused PBMs of using their market power to set reimbursement rates to levels below independent pharmacies' costs while at the same time paying their own affiliated pharmacies many times more than actual drug acquisition costs.

""When you have that conflict of interest, where the fox is guarding the hen house, then you can abuse that power as a monopoly to raise prescription drug prices and limit access for patients,"" said John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association.

CVS has been accused of limiting access to drugs by steering patients with insurance plans using CVS Caremark to their own mail-order pharmacies.

""One day I was standing at the pharmacy counter and they said you can no longer fill here, your insurance isn't going to cover it,"" said Loretta Boesing, founder of Unite for Safe Medications.

Boesing says that news was distressing—her son Wesley nearly died the last time her family had gotten drugs through a CVS mail-order pharmacy, which shipped the medication improperly. Medication Wesley needs daily so his body doesn’t reject the transplanted liver he got at the age of two.

""It was a 102-degree day here in Missouri, one of the hottest on record and they delivered the medication. I got the package, and I felt how hot it was, and I just knew that something didn't feel right. But I thought, surely, they wouldn't do this if it wasn't safe. It was a liquid oral transplant medication,"" Boesing said. ""Wesley at the time was a toddler. So, I gave it to him and then he ended up in the hospital and he was fighting for his life again.""

Boesing says when CVS shipped the drugs improperly again after forcing her to use one of their mail-order pharmacies, she dropped them.

Boesing came to Arkansas to testify in support of HB 1150, which would force companies like CVS to choose between operating as a PBM or owning pharmacies in Arkansas to eliminate the potential for predatory and exclusionary practices.

If CVS chooses to continue operating as a PBM in Arkansas, it will have to close its pharmacies here.

""All 23 stores, all of our CVS pharmacies would be shut down in 2026 and our hundreds of pharmacy colleagues would be displaced. They would be without jobs, myself included,"" said Ashley Ellis, CVS Health's district leader for pharmacy operations in Arkansas.

There are over 500 CVS pharmacy employees in the state of Arkansas.

""We're looking at 340,000 patients that would be affected and would have to find new pharmacies,"" Ellis told KATV.

CVS Health issued the following statement after HB 1150 passed in the Senate Wednesday:

This bill rips medicine away from sick patients and makes it harder for people to achieve better health. A veto will protect communities, improve care, and help hundreds of thousands of Arkansans get the medicines they need. Governor Sanders should choose people over misguided policy that will lead to serious consequences.

Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said the following in a press release Wednesday evening:

If we want to protect patient choice, lower drug costs and support local businesses, then ending PBM ownership of pharmacies is essential...this bill ensures Arkansans will continue to have access to the quality care they deserve — delivered by trusted local pharmacists, not dictated by out-of-state corporations.

If Governor Sanders signs HB 1150 into law, it will go into effect January 1, 2026.

In the viral clip, Nia and Noela calmly question why they’re being asked to leave. A manager repeatedly tells them that service is being refused but offers no clear reason. When asked directly, she says, “To be completely honest with you, I don’t have to have a reason,” and later adds that they had “been seen in here before.” One of the girls responded that she had never been in the store.

'We saw a lot of people before the political stuff were planning on getting PCs, either in the first quarter – which was good for us – or the second quarter. We are seeing people that have five-plus-year old machines, and this is the year they budgeted for it,’ says Michael Goldstein, president of LAN Infotech of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.

The 2025 PC refresh is underway with device shipments up 4.9 percent in the first quarter of the year and commercial customers showing an appetite to buy new devices, however global economic conditions make the outlook for the rest of the year challenging to predict, according to market research firm IDC.

“In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, in a statement.

Michael Goldstein, president of LAN Infotech, a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based solution provider, told CRN on Wednesday that his commercial customers appear to have baked in the cost of PCs and even stop-and-go tariffs have not slowed down their purchases. Helping all of this is Microsoft’s October deadline for Windows 10 end of life.

“We saw a lot of people before the political stuff were planning on getting PCs, either in the first quarter – which was good for us – or the second quarter,” he said. “We are seeing people that have five-plus-year old machines, and this is the year they budgeted for it.”

Goldstein’s comments to CRN fit what IDC saw in the market as well, with IDC’s Bouchard adding that just how tariffs will factor into the future spend, is still unknown.

“Evidently, commercial demand remained strong in the first quarter, but the new round of US tariffs announced on April 2 could have a direct inflationary impact on the PC market that could result in delayed IT spending for the remainder of the year,” Bouchard said in a statement.

Goldstein said he has not yet heard from vendors around pricing, but he did receive a note from a distribution partner who indicated that any additional tariff costs would be passed on to the buyer.

“You hear one thing, or you hear another. I don’t blame them for not coming up and saying it, because obviously, immediately everyone probably has (inventory),” he said. “If I go onto the disty’s site, I see plenty of desktops and laptops that are physically in stock. So, 30 days from now could change the story.”

Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers, said in a statement that so far IDC has not seen any big shifts one way or the other, which is expected given the uneven implementation of the duties.

“So far, our supply chain checks haven’t shown any drastic shifts, but this isn’t surprising as it’s almost too volatile to make drastic business decisions,” he said. “Companies are undoubtedly evaluating everything from inventory on hand, capacity to manufacture by location, possible reroute opportunities to lower import tariffs, and for some, their deal discussions with the US administration. When it comes to hardware like PCs and similar devices, we still maintain the view that most (if not all) price increases will get passed directly to the consumer.”

According to IDC figures, all of the big PC makers increased shipments in the first quarter, with Lenovo shipping 1.5 million more units, HP sent 800,000 more, Dell upped its first quarter shipments by 300,000, and Apple sent 700,000 more.

CPI, in collaboration with global leaders in digital pharma, including AstraZeneca, Atos, AWS, Capgemini, GSK, and Siemens, through its Digital Membership consortium, has launched a pioneering Digital Architecture designed to revolutionise the process of pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Digital Architecture: A Clear Roadmap for Digital Transformation

This cutting-edge framework provides a clear roadmap for integrating digital technologies, overcoming data silos, and enabling real-time release for drug manufacturing. In doing so, it empowers companies to reduce the time taken for product release from days to hours and ultimately drives the industry toward autonomous pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Digitalisation is becoming an urgent priority for pharmaceutical companies, as it plays a pivotal role in driving the decarbonisation of manufacturing processes. With health systems accounting for 5% of global carbon emissions, it’s estimated that digitalisation can cut energy consumption in manufacturing by up to 20%.

Overcoming Challenges with Digital Architecture Integration

For pharma companies striving to implement an autonomous pharmaceutical manufacturing strategy, the challenges of integrating legacy infrastructure, managing vast amounts of siloed data, and justifying capital investment have long been barriers to progress.

The Digital Architecture provides organisations with a structured, step-by-step approach to overcoming these challenges, making seamless digital transformation an achievable reality. It is a first-of-its-kind solution that enables pharmaceutical companies to incrementally integrate their Operational Technology/Information Technology (OT/IT) infrastructure, avoiding the risks of a full-scale digital overhaul. By providing a domain-driven, technology-agnostic approach, this architecture ensures that companies can implement automation at their own pace.

Global Leaders Support Digital Architecture Adoption

The architecture serves as both a roadmap and a coded blueprint and has been developed through the Digital Membership consortium at CPI’s Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre, with global leaders in pharmaceuticals, technology, and academic institutions.

Francis O’Doherty, Director, Operations IT at AstraZeneca, said: “AstraZeneca has successfully leveraged the work of this CPI collaboration to define our Autonomous Manufacturing strategy, which has supported our vision of implementing industry-leading pharmaceutical manufacturing and accelerated the development of our future-ready IT architecture.

“A technology-agnostic Digital Architecture empowers us to choose the right solutions for our enterprise, ensuring flexibility and adaptability. Together, we are pioneering a transformative journey towards a digital-first and sustainable future, where AI-driven automation is augmented with human insights and oversight.”

Digital Architecture Helps Remove Barriers to Digitalisation

Dave Tudor, Managing Director of Pharma, HealthTech, and Quality at CPI, said: “The pharmaceutical industry stands at a crossroads. Companies must embrace digitalisation to stay competitive, but the complexity of integrating digital technologies has been a significant challenge.

“CPI’s Digital Architecture removes these barriers, offering a structured, technology-agnostic roadmap that allows companies to scale digital solutions efficiently. Our collaboration with global leaders ensures that this solution is practical, actionable, and aligned with the industry's future needs.”

The Future of Autonomous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing with Digital Architecture

Samantha Jones, Atos Senior Vice President, Healthcare, Life Sciences, and Manufacturing, said: ""Together with CPI’s Digital Membership consortium, our objective is to improve the availability of therapies to patients. Using our extensive experience in digital transformation and blueprinting techniques, we have created assets that de-risk digital implementation and accelerate time to value for new processes.”

Dave Berry, Director of Digital Pharma at CPI, said: “The Digital Architecture is more than just a framework – it’s a coded resource designed to help pharmaceutical manufacturers digitalise their processes more rapidly; in a more strategic and targeted way. It enables companies to address high-impact digitalisation projects today, whilst still knowing those projects will aid the bigger picture of autonomous manufacturing.

“By moving forward with an autonomous pharmaceutical manufacturing strategy, companies can streamline operations, enhance regulatory compliance, and accelerate time-to-market for new therapies.”

Collaborative Success of Digital Architecture

Rob Pears, UK Head of Life Sciences, Manufacturing, and Automotive at Capgemini, said, “We’re committed to accelerating innovation in pharma, alongside our clients and partners. This new Digital Architecture has demonstrated the impact that can be achieved through the collaborative spirit of the ecosystem, and we’ve already seen impressive results across industry. The future of autonomous manufacturing lies in digitalisation and harnessing the power of data, and we look forward to seeing further positive outcomes through this approach for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.”",https://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/media/g0jdyiuj/2148755140.jpg?width=1002&height=564&v=1dba997cb5eb8e0,N,,2025-04-10 04:02:00.725503

El Norte Parkway a clerk did not know when the new store would open by Home Depot at W. Valley and 9th. A few days later I checked on the progress of the new store and was surprised to find it open for business. This silent opening is the second such new store I have come across lately.

You may remember I wrote about the largest auto parts store in the County that took over the old Albertsons/Stater Bros and former Rube’s Country Market location. That was another let-me-see-the-progress trip only to find the store already opened without fanfare.

Back to Dollar Tree. As I approached about 2 p.m. I noticed the door open and customers inside. I asked a clerk when they had opened and he said ‘This morning.” No hoopla, no advertising, no Chamber of Commerce welcoming committee, no Mayor thanking them for opening another outlet. I wondered how did these customers, about 20, find out the store was open? Did people just come by the store by accident and find it open?

It was interesting seeing every shelf in every aisle filled with product with some exceptions where an item had been purchased. Unlike the other Dollar Tree which for months appeared half full. It made me chuckle to see UPC scanners in the aisles (yes, plural) so customers can check the price. Hey, the store is called Dollar Tree, actually $1.25. Reminds me of an old joke by a comedian talking about going into a 99 cent store and hearing over the P.A. “Price check on register one.”

Another silent opening was a retailer next to the Post Office on N. Escondido Boulevard. Hibbett Sports, a company I have never heard of, recently opened quietly. According to their website the store is open—however I have yet to see anyone entering or leaving the store and the building shows no sign of life. Even the sign is easily missed. I hope the sporting goods store does well.

Today I saw a photo of the triathlon event Saturday in Oceanside. I get tired just reading about what is involved in this exhausting event. How about a 1.2 mile ocean swim and a 13.1 mile run and a 56 mile bike ride? In my book, anyone who can finish a triathlon deserves much credit, winning or not. Just finishing deserves a trophy.

The photo was closeup shot of a cyclist. Three spectators were shown along this portion of the ride. What struck me was that all three were not looking at the rider but had their faces in their cell phones. Seriously, why attend the event? It didn’t seem they were interested in cheering or giving encouragement to the participants. I wonder if the photographer thought the same after seeing the print.

Here we go again with yet another survey from WalletHub showing no respect for Escondido. This latest highlights the Healthiest Cities in America. Again, with a giant gasp and huh, San Francisco is numero uno in America. How the… never mind. San Diego is #5— even ahead of Surf City aka Huntington Beach at #10. Alas, North County is represented by #39 Oceanside. I’m from New Jersey and when I see Newark ranked at 142 and Detroit, Michigan ranked at 168 how does Escondido not outscore them?

Oh, this is rich. Riverside is rated #101. Years ago my wife’s grandmother lived in Riverside and had to be moved to Escondido—not only to be closer to family but air quality in Riverside was detrimental to her health. She improved dramatically after moving here. Also, Escondido isn’t even on the list of 182 cities.

Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday that Americans are behaving as if they're in a recession.

Delta, the first major carrier to report earnings since broad tariffs were announced, has suspended its 2025 forecast due to ""uncertainty.""

Domestic trips have been stalled since late February, Bastian said, adding that corporations and consumers have adopted a ""defensive posture.""

Americans are behaving as if they're in a recession, Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday as the carrier withdrew its full-year forecast.

Corporate and domestic leisure travel has stalled since late February, according to Delta, the first major airline to release earnings since widespread tariffs were announced. Demand has waned because of bad weather, ""high-profile aircraft incidents,"" and global economic uncertainties, Bastian told CNBC.

""We're acting as if we're going [into] a recession. I think everyone is going into a defensive posture,"" Bastian said. ""...If that continues and we don't get resolution soon, we will probably end up in a recession.""

Delta reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results but said it would not affirm full-year projections at this time ""given current uncertainty."" Current-quarter revenue is seen between 2% below to 2% above Q2 2024 levels, the company said.

Delta had planned to expand its capacity by about 4% in the second half of 2025, but no longer envisions growing, Bastian said. Business travel was up about 10% before stalling, he added. Price-sensitive consumers are buying fewer domestic tickets, the CEO said, adding that international travel, summer bookings, and premium ticket sales remain strong.

'Uncharted, Unprecedented Uncertainty'

""We're in uncharted, unprecedented uncertainty,"" Bastian said, adding that it was a ""self-inflicted situation.""

UBS analysts downgraded a number of airline stocks days after the Trump administration unveiled ""reciprocal"" tariffs on goods from most of the U.S.' trading partners.

Last month, several airlines lowered their forecasts as Americans were growing uneasy about the economy and planning fewer trips, executives said.

""We are seeing what others are seeing,"" JetBlue Airways (JBLU) CEO Joanna Geraghty said at a conference last month, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. ""The peaks remain healthy. The troughs obviously are under pressure.""

Here’s an overview of the big news from the opening keynote today.

Over the past year, Google says it rolled out 3,000+ updates to its cloud services. This includes improvements to Google Workspace (such as Gmail, Docs, etc.) and its AI tools. More than 4 million developers are already using its Gemini AI models, and companies are now building apps with tools like Vertex AI, Imagen (for images), and Veo (for videos).

A New Kind of Network

Google also said its cloud network which moves at “Google speed” is now available for billions of users globally at near zero latency. Dubbed Cloud WAN, Google says it is the new global internet backbone for the enterprise. Basically, it lets businesses plug into Google’s private internet network, making things run up to 40% faster and cheaper compared to old-school setups.

Next-Gen AI Hardware: Meet Ironwood

Google revealed its seventh-get Ironwood TPUs – powerful computer chips made for running large AI models. These chips are over 10 times more powerful than previous versions, giving businesses a major upgrade in computing power for AI tasks like image generation, chatbots, and more.

They’re also rolling out new GPUs from NVIDIA, faster storage systems, and smarter software to help all this tech run smoothly and at lower cost.

Smarter AI Models

Google launched Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash, the newest versions of its Gemini AI. Pro is great at deep thinking tasks like medical reports or coding, while Flash is built for fast, low-cost tasks like customer service chats or quick summaries.

They also showed off Imagen 3, which makes high-quality images from text; Chirp 3 for creating custom voices with just 10 seconds of audio; Lyria for making music from text prompts; and Veo 2, which generates and edits videos with cool features like background removal and screen resizing.

AI for Everyone

Google introduced Agentspace, a tool that helps everyday employees use AI at work—no coding required. Workers can ask AI to summarize reports, generate ideas, or find documents across their company.

Agentspace has new improvements, such as Agent Designer, a drag-and-drop tool that lets anyone create custom AI helpers, and Deep Research, an agent that digs into complex topics for you and returns an easy-to-read report.

More Use Cases: From Doctors to Developers

Google shared some practical examples of how its AI agents are making big moves in the real world for clients:

Healthcare & Retail: Doctors can search patient data more easily. Retailers like Lowe’s are using Google AI to recommend products.

Call Centres: Google’s AI now understands emotions and can even see live video to help respond better.

Creative Work: Brands like Kraft Heinz and Agoda are using Google’s AI tools to make ads and travel videos faster and more cheaply.

Coding: Google says 25% of its own code is now written by AI. New tools can help with debugging, planning, and coding in teams.

Data & Security: Their new “alert triage agent” can figure out if a cybersecurity alert is real or not, and explain why.

Google’s big push this year is to make powerful AI tools more accessible to everyone—from companies dealing with sensitive data (on local servers) to employees using a spreadsheet. The focus is on speed, cost-saving, creativity, and flexibility.

Last year, we saw Google announce Axion at its Google Cloud Next event, its first Arm-based CPU for data centres.

“The more transparent you can be as a leader, the more effective you can be as a leader,” she said. “It’s a combination of being able to flex and approach things differently depending on the environment and being able to tell you’re team what you’re doing.”

Libitz also shared that leaders should think deeply about how they show up every day for their teams.

“Now that you’ve been given an opportunity to step up as a leader, what does that mean?” she posited. “As you shift from the day-to-day and you get a seat at the table, how are you going to use it?”

The company has had a location in East Abilene for about 20 years. It needed space to expand its operations. To that end, it is working with the Development Corporation of Abilene (DCOA) to help secure its next location. DCOA President and CEO Misty Mayo explains that this project will only benefit Abilene in the long run.

“The Development Corporation works every day to ensure that both local existing companies, as well as companies outside of the Abilene area, hear about what a great place Abilene is to do business. Abilene is the premier destination for business expansion, so R+L Carriers will build a new 58,000-square-foot facility in the Development Corporation of Abilene Access Business Park,” shared Mayo.

Located in East Abilene, right across from Great Lakes Cheese, this new facility is expected to create 22 full-time jobs while retaining 16 existing positions. Over the next 10 years, it is estimated to generate an economic impact of $173 million and beyond, both directly and indirectly.

“When companies can get the supplies they need, they can continue to grow. As companies continue to grow, that means more jobs for our citizens; it means more jobs for our children and for our grandchildren. When we’re building primary jobs, we’re building a core for our community. As we build a core for our community, we’re building a future for our community,” added Mayo.

Construction for this project is expected to begin sometime this year. Another project in early development, Hamilton, is also in the works and expected to create 33 new jobs. The company’s name will be released later.

“Project Hamilton will mean new jobs for a local existing company. It’s 33 new jobs, and it’s 19 existing employees who will have an opportunity to continue to grow with their company.

Read more analyst ratings on DELL stock","Personal computer (PC) shipments rose in this year’s first quarter as orders and deliveries increased with companies scrambling to get ahead of import tariffs.

Research firm Canalys estimates that shipment for PCs rose more than 9% during Q1, while data from IDC Research pegs the growth at 5% from a year earlier. The growth translates into about 63 million PC units shipped in the first three months of the year.

The growth is good news for PC makers such as Dell Technologies (DELL) and HP Inc. (HPQ), as well as PC component manufacturers such as Logitech International (LOGI). The rise in PC shipments comes as companies and consumers raced to beat the deadline for U.S. President Donald Trump’s import tariffs, which threatened to raise prices for computers and other electronics that are made outside America.

Return to Growth

The Q1 sales growth was especially welcome given that the PC market has been largely stagnant in recent years following a surge in purchases during the Covid-19 pandemic when people were working and going to school remotely from home. In 2024, worldwide PC shipments increased only 1% after two straight years of declines, according to IDC data.

Despite the strong sales between January and March, it remains to be seen how President Trump’s ongoing tariffs will impact demand going forward, especially with a 125% tariff placed on goods imported from China, where much of the world’s PC manufacturing takes place. Canalys said notebook shipments grew 10% during Q1 to more than 49 million units, while desktop shipments rose 8%.

Google Cloud has taken a major step toward revolutionizing how marketers and agencies operate by unveiling new AI-driven tools designed to simplify marketing processes and elevate customer experience. The announcement was made during the company’s much anticipated Next ’25 conference held in Las Vegas from April 9 to 11.

The new developments come at a time when marketers globally are under increasing pressure to meet evolving consumer expectations, manage longer buying journeys, and cut through a growing clutter of information overload. According to Carrie Tharp, Vice President for Global Solutions and Industries at Google Cloud, AI is key to navigating these shifting dynamics and regaining marketing efficiency.

Google Cloud’s latest innovations include the integration of Lyria, a generative text-to-music AI model, into its Vertex AI platform. This positions Google as the only platform currently offering generative capabilities across video, image, speech, and music. Brands can now create custom soundtracks for product launches, branded content, or immersive in-store experiences with unprecedented ease and speed.

Major global brands are already leveraging these AI tools. L’Oréal Groupe is using Vertex’s Veo and Imagen tools to speed up the creation of high-quality visual assets across 20 countries, while Kraft Heinz has reported an eight-week creative process being compressed.

Closer to home, this innovation signals a significant opportunity for Nigerian and African brands that want to stay globally competitive. With growing access to AI-powered platforms, agencies and marketers across the continent can explore how these tools can reduce production timelines, personalize customer journeys, and generate real-time campaign insights, into just eight hours using Google’s AI capabilities. According to the company, these tools are reshaping how creative teams approach content development, from ideation to execution.

Google’s Creative Agencies are also being adopted by major industry players. WPP has integrated them into its Open platform, Brandtech Group is using Pencil to predict and optimize ad performance, and Papa Johns has partnered with Google to use AI across ordering, delivery, and marketing. The potential for localized, one-to-one marketing through these tools marks a paradigm shift in how data-driven customer engagement is executed.

Google Cloud says its focus remains on simplifying these innovations so marketers, merchants, analysts, and brand managers can seamlessly integrate them into their daily processes. As brands increasingly seek speed, creativity, and personalization. Google’s latest offerings are poised to set a new standard for how modern marketing is done.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image_fx-3.png,N,,2025-04-09 17:07:13.542186

Dr. Saltman referenced the Third Party Review Program, where accredited Third-Party Review Organizations can review low-to-moderate risk medical devices.

Liberation Day dilemmas Though not directly tied to FDA layoffs, the tariffs imposed by the current administration could be devastating to medical device manufacturing, commercialization, and innovation.","During an April 7 session of the Biopharma Congress, Janet Woodcock, MD, former acting FDA Commissioner and former principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs, called the recent FDA staff cuts a “slow-moving catastrophe.”

Dr. Woodcock was referring to drug development, but the same could be said for medical device development. Devices will still move through the regulatory pathways, but the process could take longer, and there could be mistakes.

Jeff Shuren, MD, longtime director of FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), who retired last year, said during Biopharma Congress and during a recent NAMSA webinar that “it would not be surprising if we saw longer review times, at least in the near term.”

That’s because CDRH recently lost 3,500 employees, many of them involved in premarket review. Some of those individuals could be reinstated—or not. And that’s if they decide to come back.

Dr. Shuren said FDA will need to focus on recruitment and retention as well as leverage digital tools to improve efficiency. Generative AI is a possible solution for certain tasks, such as email composition and similar low-risk tasks. The Digital Health Policy Navigator can help developers determine the regulatory status of a given software function.

R.I.P. open communication

Of the many concerns that arise from staff cuts, Martin Leon, MD, Mallah Family Professor of Cardiology at Columbia University, director of Columbia Care Center for Interventional Care at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and founder of Cardiovascular Research Foundation, said he observed that FDA “no longer has a public-facing interaction capability.” That interaction refers to the early and open communication FDA worked for years to establish.

“What we were most proud of was the fact that we had open communication with the agency,” he said. “We could discuss regulatory science, we could brainstorm new ways to be able to improve how we manage certain approval processes…that dynamic of an open communication process was extremely helpful.”

Dr. Leon’s statement sparked a new question from webinar moderator and NAMSA Chief Medical Officer Adam Saltman, MD, PhD: Should the industry step in to fill in the gaps? Dr. Saltman referenced the Third Party Review Program, where accredited Third-Party Review Organizations can review low-to-moderate risk medical devices. Could we do more of that?

Juan Granada, MD, president and CEO of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, said he would applaud potential public-private collaboration, such as between FDA and CROs, to assist with certain reviews. However, device clearance processes must remain standardized, and the collaboration must not add complexity to an already complex process.

Ken Ouriel, MD, an executive VP and KOL managing director at NAMSA, reminded the panel that medical device companies pay hefty fees to work with FDA. User fees cover about half of the FDA’s total budget.

Liberation Day dilemmas

Though not directly tied to FDA layoffs, the tariffs imposed by the current administration could be devastating to medical device manufacturing, commercialization, and innovation. “If you have to bring in materials that are more expensive, or are no longer available, or if we damage relationships with countries that have certain expertise, that’s going to affect importation, manufacturing, and cost,” said Dr. Granada. “And if someone puts tariffs on medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that’s going to make access even more complicated for countries that need them.”

Leon agreed, noting that FDA, NIH, and CDC have done a great job at fostering global connections. However, “tariffs really do fragment relationships, and those relationships have been forged over the course of decades,” he said.

To counter some of the negative chatter about globalization, Leon suggests manufacturers emphasize positive outcomes where possible. “Some of the most important medical products we've developed have resulted from global communications and global interactions because there is great science all around the world,” he said. “And when you put people together, it really is synergistic. So I would try to emphasize that it's embedded within the entire innovation process. Make that a key point: we can't function in isolation and expect to achieve what we've been able to achieve over the past several decades.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blte57a652d95a4ded6/67f6d7b5ddb6d87ab6291e15/Copy_of_MD_DI_Quote_Graphic_(1600x900)_(1).png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-09 21:00:32.881280

2 seller BelGioioso Cheese (dollar sales up 23% YoY to $43.5 million and unit sales up 26% YoY to 9 million); No.
The Nashville based company’s dollar sales and unit sales both jumped 14% to $70 million and 11.4 million, respectively.
Within the shelf-stable grated cheese category, dollar sales suffered a small YoY dollar sales loss of 2% to $671 million, while unit sales dipped by 1% to 154 million.","Overall, it has been a strong past 52 weeks for cheese, especially when looking at the natural cheese category. There were some pockets of weakness however, mainly the processed cheese and grated cheese subcategories, according to Chicago-based market research firm Circana’s data for the 52 weeks ending Jan. 26.

Let’s start with the natural cheese category, which counts natural cheese-shredded, natural cheese-chunks, natural cheese-slices, natural cheese-string/stick, natural cheese crumbled, natural cheese-all other forms, ricotta cheese, natural cheese-cube and refrigerated grated cheese as subcategories. Impressively, all of these subcategories had year-over-year (YoY) dollar-sales improvements compared to the prior 52-week period, with the exceptions of ricotta cheese and natural cheese-cube. Yet, both of those subcategories only suffered small losses of less than 1%, respectively.

The entire natural cheese category saw dollar sales rise by 3% YoY to $20.6 billion, while unit sales enjoyed the same YoY percentage increase to 5.1 billion. Looking at specific subcategories, we’ll kick it off with natural cheese-shredded, whose YoY dollar sales picked up a 1% gain to $7.4 billion, matched by the same YoY percentage gain in unit sales to 1.98 billion. Leading the way in the natural cheese-shredded subcategory is private label, whose dollar sales picked up 0.4% YoY to $5.2 billion, along with a 1% unit sales rise to 1.4 billion, Circana data reports. A big standout in this subcategory was No. 6 seller V&V Supremo Foods. The Chicago-based company’s dollar sales rose 42% YoY to $91 million, bested by a 51% unit sales increase to just shy of 10 million.

The natural cheese-chunks subcategory also had a strong year, Dollar sales gained 7% to $5.78 billion, while unit sales jumped 8% YoY to 1.26 billion. The top seller here is once again private label, gaining 8% YoY to $2.1 billion in dollar sales, bested by a 10% unit sales rise to 601 million. No. 2 seller, Tillamook County Creamery Association, also had a solid year, with dollar sales picking up 11% YoY to $399 million, pairing well with a 13% jump in unit sales to 57 million.

Natural cheese-slice dollar sales eked out a small 0.5% YoY gain to $3.7 billion, but unit sales came in at just over $1 billion, good for a 4% improvement, Circana data reveals. Once again, private label took the top spot in this subcategory, with dollar sales rising 4% YoY to $1.9 billion and unit sales pocking up a slid 7% YoY to 640 million. A star in this subcategory was Cabot Creamery. The Vermont-based division of Agri-Mark enjoyed a 19% YoY dollar sales increase to just shy of $60 million, along with a 16% YoY unit sales jump to 16 million.

Next up is natural cheese-string/stick, whose dollar sales improved by 2% YoY to $1.8 billion, but unit sales suffered a small loss of 1% to 391 million. Private label, again, assumed the top spot in this subcategory. It outpaced many competitors, evidenced by its 5% YoY dollar sales increase to $626 million, with unit sales gaining the YoY percentage gain to 151 million. Enjoying a strong year in this subcategory was Lactalis American Group, the No. 4 seller. The Buffalo, N.Y.-based company saw dollar sales and unit sales both jump 15% YoY to $119 million and 18.5 million, respectively.

Natural cheese-crumbled’s overall dollar sales rose 2% to $636 million, with unit sales increasing a similar 1% to 133.4 million. For the first time, private label was not the leading seller in this subcategory. Instead, this honor goes to Seymour, Wis.-based Emmi Roth USA Inc., whose dollar sales popped by 3% YoY to $165 million, as well as a 0.3% unit sales gain to 30.3 million. No. 5 seller, Monroe, Wis.-based La Morenita Food Products, had a strong year in this subcategory, enjoying a 15% YoY dollar sales rise to $43 million and a 13% unit sales rise to 5.5 million, according to Circana.

Next up is natural cheese-all other forms, which sported a robust 8% YoY jump to $546 million and a 5% unit sales gain to $106 million, for the 52-week period ending Jan. 26. The No. 1 seller for that timeframe was Belgioioso Cheese. The Green Bay, Wis.-based company’s dollar sales and unit sales both gained 5% YoY to $198 million and 35 million, respectively. Although on a much smaller scale, Bel Brands USA has to be mentioned for its growth in the natural cheese-all other forms subcategory. The Chicago-based company’s dollar sales came in $15.2 million and unit sales reached 1.43 million. Each skyrocketed by more than 8 million percentage points YoY, states Circana.

When it comes to ricotta cheese, dollar sales dipped by 0.6% YoY to $321 million, along with unit sales declining by nearly 1% to 76.5 million. Private label is the leading seller in this subcategory, with its dollar sales bucking the overall trend by rising 3% YoY to $133.5 million and unit sales picking up 1% to 38 million. Another standout in this subcategory was Saputo Cheese USA Inc., whose dollar sales and unit sales both increased by 11% YoY to $7.6 million and 1.4 million, respectively.

Natural cheese-cubed also saw slight YoY declines, as dollar sales dipped by 0.3% to $222 million and unit sales came in at 60 million, a 1% YoY loss, Circana data shows. Private label was the leader in this category, with dollar sales rising 3% to $138.5 million, while unit sales increased by 1% to 42.5 million. Green Bay, Wis.-based BelGioioso Cheese was a superstar in this subcategory, as its dollar and unit sales both rose by 19% to $3.8 million and 767,254, respectively.

The final subcategory under natural cheese is refrigerated grated cheese, which had a fantastic 52-week period.

Margaret McDonald has spent the past 26 years collecting and using data to advance improvements in home health and community-based care.

An administrative leader of the only research center embedded in a home care organization, she guides a team of 30 researchers. Her team’s National Institutes of Health-funded research studies have focused on improving healthcare for the country’s most vulnerable populations, including homebound older adults, people living with disabilities, underserved minority groups, and those with multiple chronic conditions who need support to live independently and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.

McDonald is a mentor to junior researchers and fosters collaboration among her team and other clinicians, scientists and providers.

“As a leader, Margaret keenly understands the importance of listening and collaboration,” noted her Pinnacle Award nominator. “Her vision is as essential as it is expansive.”

McDonald’s research has made significant contributions to the home care field. In a recent study, she and her team used technology to identify people at higher risk of adverse medication-related events and developed a plan to mitigate those risks. That study helped facilitate the development and integration of new decision support tools for medication management.

She also has overseen primary data collection and clinical intervention research of more than 4,000 patients and caregivers. This effort has involved conducting in-home interviews and observations to gain insights from people receiving in-home care to improve understanding of those issues and the challenges facing patients managing complex clinical conditions.

Often honored, McDonald has co-authored more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications and a variety of other publications.

She earned a Master of Social Work degree from Fordham University and a bachelor’s degree in health administration from the New York University Stern School of Business.

McDonald started her career as a research coordinator at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

The McKnight’s Pinnacle Awards program is jointly administered by McKnight’s Senior Living, McKnight’s Long-Term Care News and McKnight’s Home Care.

MINNEAPOLIS — As wildfire response and emergency rescue demands grow, ensuring first responders have the right tools at their disposal is more critical than ever. Polaris Government and Defense has supported fire and rescue operations for decades, providing off-road vehicles and job-specific accessories that enhance traditional apparatus fleets – helping departments increase mobility and reduce response times in remote areas and during disaster response. Expanding its portfolio of purpose-built solutions, Polaris introduces two new QTAC firefighting skids from MTECH, Inc.: the 9HP Fire & Rescue and Ultra High Pressure (UHP) Firefighting Skids, validated for RANGER XD 1500, RANGER XP 1000 and RANGER XP Kinetic.

“It is imperative that fire and emergency teams respond with confidence, and that means having the right equipment to get the job done efficiently and effectively,” said Tony Stanley, business development, Polaris Government and Defense. “Polaris continues to drive innovation in emergency response mobility. The introduction of our new firefighting skids, alongside our proven lineup of fire and rescue UTVs and turn-key packages, furthers our commitment to equipping first responders with high-performance, mission-ready solutions.”

With new legislation proposing increased funding and resources – including response time standards – highly mobile, rapidly deployable emergency vehicles are essential. Polaris fire and rescue UTVs are designed to meet this need, improving response time and extending reach without compromising mobility, budget or effectiveness. When equipped with fully validated QTAC skids, these vehicles offer integrated water transport, pump and hose systems and patient transport solutions.

New QTAC Fire & Rescue Skid Offerings for RANGER Vehicles

The QTAC 75UHP Firefighting Skid delivers powerful fire suppression in a compact, cost-effective package, utilizing ultra-high-pressure (UHP) pump technology originally developed by the U.S. Air Force. With a flow rate of 6.7 GPM at 1,200 psi, it maximizes efficiency, providing 11 minutes of continuous firefighting on a single 75-gallon tank. Built from impact-resistant, non-corrosive copolymer, it features a 2.5-gallon foam cell, an electric UHP technology offers key advantages over traditional centrifugal systems, including smaller water droplets that convert to steam faster for efficient heat transfer, reduced water consumption to minimize damage and enhanced foam penetration to cut off the fire’s fuel source and prevent re-ignition.

The QTAC 9HP Fire and Rescue Skid is a UTV EMS firefighting system featuring a unique, flip-down rescue litter platform. This convertible design maintains a compact footprint while utilizing a 60-gallon welded-copolymer tank. When secured in the down position, the platform accommodates a full-size rescue litter and when folded, it remains compact enough to allow the tailgate of a standard short-bed UTV to close. Equipped with a 9HP pump with a standard electric start, the skid ensures reliable water delivery and the capability to draft from an auxiliary water source.

Manufactured by MTECH, Inc., QTAC fire and rescue skids are specially integrated on Polaris RANGER utility vehicles, with a purposely designed mounting system from Polaris – allowing for easy install and removal of the skid with no drilling or modifying of the UTV. QTAC skids are built with PolyTough® construction, a lightweight ultra durable material that withstands extreme temperatures for the highest level of performance for years to come. The 75UHP Firefighting Skid and the 9HP Fire and Rescue Skid are available on RANGER XD 1500, RANGER XP 1000 and RANGER XP Kinetic UTVs.

New QTAC Fire & Rescue Skid Offerings for RANGER Vehicles

The company’s lineup of validated Fire and Rescue vehicle packages complete with QTAC Fire and Rescue skids, including the QTAC Firefighting skid, the QTAC Fire & Rescue Skid and the QTAC Rescue Skid will be on display at FDIC International in Polaris booth #3265, April 10-12 in Indianapolis.

The QTAC Firefighting Skid is capable of drafting, applying retardants and small-scale fire suppression. It is ideal for use cases such as small to large scale prescribed burn control, grass and prairie burns and incident mop-up. The firefighting skid features additional options, including a 2.5-gallon foam capacity, a draft hose kit, an electric hose reel option, a viper nozzle and a 9-horsepower version with electric start.

The Fire & Rescue Skid includes a unique, convertible rescue litter platform that allows for the tailgate to be closed on the UTV when not in use. This skid is ideal for the same use cases as the firefighting skid with the addition of remote rescue and public event safety. The Fire & Rescue Skid can also be equipped with optional 2.5-gallon foam capacity, a draft hose kit, electric hose reel option and a viper nozzle. Options also include a 6-horsepower and 9-horsepower version.

The QTAC Rescue Skid has a full-size rescue area, sliding storage and an attendant seat, with optional IV pole and O2 bottle mounts available. The skid is ideal for remote rescue operations and public event safety.

QTAC fire skid options feature water capacities between 60 and 85 gallons and Waterax Versax 6 or 9-horsepower pumps for maximum capacity and reliability. Each skid configuration can be mounted to RANGER XP 1000, RANGER XD 1500 and RANGER XP Kinetic vehicles.

Built to help responders navigate areas inaccessible to traditional vehicles, this year’s FDIC lineup includes the RANGER CREW XD 1500 NorthStar, RANGER CREW XP 1000 and RANGER XP 1000 NorthStar Standard. Each vehicle will be specifically outfitted for fire and rescue operations.

Polaris Fire and Rescue UTVs

Polaris firefighting UTVs incorporate a professional system that is familiar, and fire skid packages incorporate a capable pump, hose and reel, tanks for water and foam and the ability to draft from an external water source. Rescue vehicles incorporate a rear attendant seat is also available, which includes the fire tank and equipment option for the rear equipment skids to be removed all together for additional applications or use by other departments. Custom graphics and body panels can be added so vehicles match the rest of the fleet. And these UTVs are compatible with traditional Polaris accessories options.",https://lexipol.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc6d9ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-lexipol.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fc7%2Ff77d3c614332ab9b7ccaeccebebd%2Ffr1-affiliate-images-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 17:07:31.206593

H&M is taking a high-profile leap into generative AI, creating digital twins of 30 real-life models for use in ads and social content. The move is already stirring debate.

For some, the move is a savvy blend of tech and trend. For others, it raises thornier questions about authenticity, creativity, and what happens when “real” people are rendered optional.

H&M says the project is deeply collaborative. “We are doing this in close collaborations with other creatives within the industry, as well as model agencies and the models themselves, who will hold the right of usage to their digital twin,” said Jörgen Andersson, H&M’s chief creative officer, in a statement. “We are curious to explore how to showcase our fashion in new creative ways -- and embrace the benefits of new technology -- while staying true to our commitment to personal style. This initiative is about exactly this: exploring the benefits of what generative AI can bring to the creative process… Ultimately, H&M’s purpose is to liberate fashion for the many and to celebrate self-expression in everything we do.”

While other fashion brands -- including Levi’s, Calvin Klein, Prada, and Balmain -- have dabbled in AI-generated models, H&M’s approach takes things a step further. By creating digital twins of real people, the retailer is exploring how these avatars might function not just as visual assets, but as influencers in their own right.

“It’s inevitable this will be adopted quite widely by brands,” says Karen Fielding, chief strategy officer at General Idea, which works with luxury clients including Louis Vuitton and Coach. “How they adopt it, and in which places, will be what’s interesting.”

In practical terms, the appeal is clear: AI speeds up content production, cuts costs, and reduces the need for time-consuming photo shoots. But from a branding perspective, the move is more complex -- especially for a company built on the tension between accessibility and aspiration. “H&M’s business model has always been delivering a Vogue-like kind of brand image at the cheapest possible price,” Fielding says. “To me, the question is, are they still delivering that kind of luxury and image, if they're using this technology rather than real people?”

Ansley Williams, head of influence at Ogilvy North America, sees opportunity in the technology's use, but urges caution. “Does this effort serve a creative purpose? Is this a cost-saving move? Or a different way to appeal to the consumer?” she asks. She notes that Ogilvy has worked extensively with virtual influencers, including Lu from Brazilian retailer Magalu, who has built a large and loyal following by blending digital identity with human-like storytelling.

Williams says consumers deserve transparency about what they’re seeing. “We’re really passionate about disclosure,” she says. But she also believes the real opportunity lies in augmenting -- not replacing -- human connection. “From a creative perspective, people build connection with real people. And when they see real humans being able to interact with clothing and fashion, it adds a human element.”

She predicts a kind of aesthetic whiplash as AI-generated visuals become more common, with a rebound toward messy, imperfect, unmistakably human content. “Maybe we’ll just completely bounce back to what’s true in reality,” she says.

Fielding agrees, especially for luxury. As AI floods the market with infinite amounts of polished but generic imagery, she expects high-end brands to double down on emotional storytelling, craftsmanship, and imperfection. “There will be a move to things that are human -- handmade, imperfect things,” she says. “And those will become more prevalent in luxury.”

But just as most people will never be able to distinguish between a real Hermes bag or a fake, consumers aren’t likely to spend much time poring over the endless stream of fashion images, challenging themselves to spot the imposters. Even if they could, many would still prefer the affordability of mass-produced goods over pricey bespoke options, Fielding adds.

For now, even H&M doesn’t know where this leads. “It’s all about testing and learning,” says Williams. “I know that’s boring. But it’s still so true.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/04/09/screenshot-2025-04-09-at-104153-am_aYXYIB7.png,N,,2025-04-09 20:06:42.631167

Hatfield, through his attorney, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he “unequivocally” denied the allegations revealed in the unsealed surveys.
The Oregonian/OregonLive fights prior restraint in the case Still, the legal battle over documents in the case isn’t finished.
The appeals court panel in March overturned a lower court’s ruling that declined to claw back sealed court records that The Oregonian/OregonLive independently obtained from an attorney for the plaintiffs.
“I find the decision baffling and quite troubling on First Amendment grounds,” said Therese Bottomly, editor of The Oregonian/OregonLive.","Documents made public in a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit against Nike reveal for the first time the names of nearly two dozen company employees, including several former top executives as well as high-ranking employees still with Nike, who were accused in anonymous complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior and harassment.

As The Oregonian/OregonLive reported, the new information contradicts Nike’s previous public statements that the complaints largely named managers below its executive ranks.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered the documents to be unsealed last month after Business Insider, The Oregonian/OregonLive, and Portland Business Journal fought for years to make public more than 5,000 pages of case filings that detail Nike’s response to reports of a “boys’ club” culture within the company. The media coalition was represented by attorneys from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

But the Ninth Circuit panel also issued a separate ruling that clears the way for a lower court to silence The Oregonian/OregonLive’s reporting on other records that it independently obtained outside the litigation, reasoning that the news outlet had submitted to the district court’s power to protect discovery documents by filing an unsealing motion in the case. Last week, joining The Oregonian/OregonLive’s original counsel in that separate appeal, Reporters Committee attorneys asked the Ninth Circuit to rehear the issue, arguing that the panel’s decision as it stands will have a “crippling chilling effect on press coverage of important judicial proceedings.”

“The press plays a vital role in enforcing the public’s right to know what unfolds in the federal courts, as the Nike litigation illustrates,” said Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee. “But standing up for the public’s right to see judicial records shouldn’t come at the cost of your right to gather the news outside the courtroom.”

The legal fight for court records

The documents at the center of a three-year fight for transparency by Insider, The Oregonian/OregonLive, and Portland Business Journal are related to a lawsuit that several female Nike employees filed against the company in 2018, alleging gender-based pay disparities and sexual harassment at the sportswear giant.

The plaintiffs asked a federal district court in Oregon to convert the lawsuit into a class action on behalf of more than 5,000 current and former female Nike workers who they argued were subject to systemic discrimination and harassment. To support their motion for class certification, the plaintiffs presented internal surveys that a group of Nike employees collected from their peers to document their experiences at the company, known as the Starfish surveys.

But those records and others related to the motion for class certification were filed under a protective order, leaving the public in the dark about the underlying facts surrounding a pivotal moment in the case, Clary said.

“Class certification is typically the single most important moment in any putative class action. It’s where cases live and die,” Clary said. “Allowing parties to seal the evidence that they submit in support or in opposition to class certification as a matter of course would withdraw an enormous amount of material from public view.”

In 2022, ahead of the court’s decision on whether to certify the class, Reporters Committee attorneys representing the news organizations challenged the protective order that shrouded the documents in secrecy. The court later made public over 5,000 pages of records, including most of the Starfish surveys, but it redacted the names of Nike employees accused of misconduct.

As Insider reported, the unsealed court records provided “the most detailed look yet” at the allegations against Nike, which The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal first chronicled at the height of the “#MeToo” movement.

According to Insider, in the Starfish surveys, female Nike employees alleged “abhorrent sexual behavior combined with corporate bullying, fear of retaliation, and a lack of faith in Nike’s willingness to do anything about it.” Other court documents claimed that Nike paid women $11,000 a year less than men between 2015 to 2019. Nike said that calculation wasn’t accurate and there was no gender pay gap.

In late 2022, the district court denied class certification in the case. Soon after, Reporters Committee attorneys sought to unseal the remaining redacted documents on behalf of the media coalition, arguing that the public has a common law right of access to the records that the court used to make its determination.

Nike argued that the records should be shielded from public view because they weren’t related to the merits of the case, and even if they were, releasing them would subject its employees to embarrassment and create a “media circus.”

Two federal judges sided with the news organizations, finding that the records were related to the case’s merits and that the public’s strong interest in the filings outweighed the privacy interests Nike wanted the court to protect. Nike appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which heard oral arguments in February. Clary represented the media coalition at the hearing.

Last month, the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court’s ruling, lifting the redactions from the Starfish surveys and shedding more light on the allegations that rattled Nike in 2018.

The now-unredacted documents allege misconduct by high-ranking employees, some of whom have since left the company and some of whom remain, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. One Starfish survey included a list of men that an anonymous complainant described as “well known philanderers with lower level employees whom they exert influence and power over,” which includes Nike’s former No. 2 executive Charlie Denson and Tinker Hatfield, who designed some of Nike’s most iconic Air Jordan models.

Hatfield, through his attorney, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he “unequivocally” denied the allegations revealed in the unsealed surveys. Denson didn’t immediately respond to The Oregonian/OregonLive’s request for comment via phone and email messages, the outlet reported.

In a statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive after the Ninth Circuit ruling, Nike said it “conducted a large-scale investigation” in response to employee complaints, including those in the Starfish surveys, “and took corrective action where appropriate.” The company has also changed its policies and procedures to make it easier for employees to raise concerns, it added.

“Nike is committed to a workplace that is respectful and inclusive of all employees, and we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form,” the company said in the statement, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive. “We take any and all accusations seriously, objectively look at the facts, and take appropriate action based on the information received.”

Nike recently agreed to settle the lawsuit, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.

The Oregonian/OregonLive fights prior restraint in the case

Still, the legal battle over documents in the case isn’t finished. On behalf of The Oregonian/OregonLive, Reporters Committee attorneys are joining the organization’s original counsel in challenging a separate Ninth Circuit ruling that would allow a district court to issue an unconstitutional prior restraint against the news outlet.

The appeals court panel in March overturned a lower court’s ruling that declined to claw back sealed court records that The Oregonian/OregonLive independently obtained from an attorney for the plaintiffs.

Last year, the attorney asked a federal judge to force The Oregonian/OregonLive to return or destroy documents that she inadvertently emailed to the news outlet after she met with one of its reporters for a story that was not about the litigation. A district court denied the request, ruling that The Oregonian/OregonLive obtained the records lawfully and has a First Amendment right to report on them. Nike appealed to the Ninth Circuit.

In reversing the district court’s decision, the appeals panel held that because the outlet had separately intervened to challenge the protective order in the case, it became a party in the lawsuit and therefore could be prohibited from reporting on information that remained under seal. The panel sent the case back to the district court for further action.

“I find the decision baffling and quite troubling on First Amendment grounds,” said Therese Bottomly, editor of The Oregonian/OregonLive. “We simply intervened in a very limited way on behalf of the public good and should not have to set aside our constitutional rights to do so.”

This month, Reporters Committee attorneys began representing The Oregonian/Oregon Live alongside its original counsel and asked the Ninth Circuit to rehear the case.

In the petition for rehearing, Reporters Committee attorneys argue that the panel’s decision “will put the press to an impossible choice: Refrain from exercising the right of access to judicial records, or risk forfeiting the right to gather the news ‘through means independent of the court’s processes.’” It would have a chilling effect on news reporting, they argue, “at the ultimate expense of the public.”

“The classic First Amendment rule should have governed here,” the petition states. “No branch of government has the power to bar the press from publishing lawfully acquired, truthful information on a matter of public concern.”",https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Grayson-at-Cahill-v.-Nike-oral-argument.png,N,,2025-04-09 17:07:22.702321

The acquisition allows Kapitus to expand its product offering to include equipment finance and working capital loans to its client base.","The relatively high interest rate environment which hampered the M&A market for equipment finance companies in 2022 and 2023 carried into the first half of

2024, setting the stage for another year of limited transaction activity. The Federal Reserve’s continued battle against inflation over the past three years resulted in seven Federal Funds rate increases during 2022 followed by four more increases in 2023, increasing the target rate range from 0 to 25 basis points to a 21-year record-high range of 5.25 – 5.50 basis points. At the start of 2024, it appeared as if the Federal Reserve’s aggressive actions during 2023 were driving us toward a soft landing. Inflation had dropped significantly from 6.5% in December of 2022 to 3.4% in December of 2023. Based in part on these results, the Fed was predicting at least four rate cuts during 2024, hinting that the rate cuts might start as early as March of 2024, providing optimism to the market that inflation was indeed behind us, and we would soon return to a lower-rate environment.

Unfortunately, persistently high inflation rates combined with low unemployment and strong jobs reports in the first half of 2024 delayed the Fed’s proposed rate cuts, creating more uncertainty and confusion about the economic environment. It wasn’t until September of 2024 that the first of three rate cuts would occur with a reduction of 50 basis points in September and additional 25-basis-pointcuts in each of November and December. Some have argued that the 2024 rate reductions have been too aggressive, as inflation reversed course and increased from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, well above the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2.0%. The Fed is now indicating that future rate cuts may be limited, and some have indicated that the Fed may have to actually reverse course and raise the target rates again if inflation persists.

For most of 2024, election uncertainty influenced the M&A market. The United States faced two candidates and administrations with very different ideas about the regulatory environment, energy policy, tariffs and trade, corporate and personal tax policies and other important factors influencing the M&A market, company valuations and potential future business conditions. In addition, geopolitical risks associated with the United States involvement in wars in both the Middle East and Europe created additional uncertainty about the general health of the economy and government spending.

NOTABLE RECENT TRANSACTIONS

Despite the challenging M&A environment, there were still a handful of notable equipment finance transactions that took place throughout 2024. In March of 2024, Vivakor, a publicly held company focused on developing, acquiring, accumulating and operating assets, properties and technologies in the energy sector, signed a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire Meridian Equipment Leasing, Endeavor Crude, Equipment Transport and Silver Fuels Processing from Jorgan Development and JBAH Holdings, for approximately $170 million. The purchase price consisted of approximately $120 million paid at closing in common stock and the balance was subject to the combined companies achieving a minimum of $12 million of EBITDA in 2024 and would be paid in Company Series A Preferred Stock.

Quiktrak, founded in 1991 and headquartered in Beaverton, Ore., acquired TKS Group in March 2024. Quiktrak provides asset verification, floorplan auditing and risk management services to the equipment leasing and finance industry. According to the press release, the acquisition of TKS Group, based in Madrid, Spain, expands Quiktrak’s offerings to include an end-to-end technology solution for managing assets and audit processes providing advanced insights and risk management solutions to customers.

In April 2024, in an effort to streamline its operations and create a more efficient business model, Société Générale agreed to sell the majority of Société Générale Equipment Finance (SGEF) to Group BPCE for approximately $1.2 billion. According to the press release, Société Générale would maintain equipment leasing and financing activities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. SGEF operated in 25 countries through a network of dealers, manufacturers, vendors and banks with a focus on transportation, industrial, technology, medical and renewable energy equipment. Group BPCE has committed to using its capital and resources to grow and expand SGEF’s activities internationally. According to Group BPCE’s press release, the acquisition will position the company as the leading provider of equipment financing solutions in Europe.

JA Mitsui Leasing, through its subsidiary JA Mitsui Leasing USA Holdings, acquired Oakmont Capital Holdings (dba Oakmont Capital Services) in April 2024. Oakmont, headquartered in West Chester, Pa., with a full-service office in Albany, Minn., provides small-ticket commercial equipment financing and working capital solutions nationwide. Oakmont was founded in 1998, initially operating as a full-service independent brokerage and made the transition to a full-service lessor shortly after adding a lift-out team consisting of 11 former Stearns Equipment Finance professionals in July 2018. The acquisition provided JA Mitsui with the ability to expand its current operations by adding a streamlined small-ticket financing solution to its existing equipment financing operations in the United States.

Centra Funding, a nationwide equipment finance company headquartered in Plano, Texas, announced last May that it had acquired the LeaseQ Restaurant and Franchise Team and the associated equipment finance platform from TimePayment Corp. With the acquisition, Centra expands its commitment to the foodservice industry and will continue to partner with TimePayment to provide instant approvals for micro-ticket restaurant and franchise transactions. Centra anticipates that the offering will be rebranded to Centra Culinary Finance and will be led by Sandra Van Buren and Kim Lorang. According to John Boettigheimer, president of Centra, the company looks forward to adapting the LeaseQ platform across many of the other industries Centra serves.

In August, GreatAmerica Financial Services hired a team of eight technology leasing and financing individuals led by Jonathan Fales. Prior to joining GreatAmerica, Fales was a divisional president of LEAF Commercial Capital and led the VAR Technology Finance business that LEAF acquired in 2019. With the acquisition, GreatAmerica hopes to expand its existing technology offerings to the value-added reseller and national service provider markets.

In September, Liventus, a custom software development firm headquartered in Northbrook, Ill., announced its acquisition of Sparkflow Data Analytics. Liventus was founded in 2002 and serves the equipment finance, fintech, insurance, healthcare and eCommerce industries. Sparkflow provides innovative data warehouse and analytic model design tools. The acquisition provides Liventus with the ability to combine its custom software development with Sparkflow’s data analytics to better position the company to meet its customer’s needs.

Strategic Funding Source, dba Kapitus, founded in 2006, a fintech specializing in business loans for small and medium businesses, announced the acquisition of Ten Oaks Commercial Capital in October. The acquisition allows Kapitus to expand its product offering to include equipment finance and working capital loans to its client base.

North Mill Equipment Finance, headquartered in Norwalk, Conn., announced in November 2024 that it had acquired 100% of the stock of TF Group, dba Taycor Financial. North Mill is focused on originating small and medium-sized commercial equipment leases and loans through third-party referral origination sources. The Taycor Financial acquisition expands this offering through Taycor’s focus on developing and strengthening vendor and direct origination programs.

In December, CHG-Meridian Group, a technology company focused on providing customers with custom technology financing solutions, acquired Meridian Leasing, a managed services provider for cloud, infrastructure and IT security. CHG-Meridian Group believes the merger will result in increased profitability and improved customer offerings.

THE CURRENT MARKET

The M&A market continued to improve during the second half of 2024, due in large part to the reductions in the federal funds target rates. M&A activity and company valuations are heavily influenced by levels of liquidity and access to credit, portfolio quality, stock market trends, unemployment rates, political and economic uncertainty and business confidence levels. One of the more influential factors in determining the level of M&A activity and company valuations is interest rates. When interest rates fall, potential acquirers can afford to pay higher prices for target companies, which generally results in more opportunities for successful transactions. In addition, sellers who hold fixed-rate portfolios where the majority of the originations took place during a higher interest rate environment will benefit from higher net interest margins and profitability.

Industry performance remained strong in 2024 and several companies are reporting record-high originations and profitability for the year. In fact, the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association recently reported in its CapEx Finance Index that year-to-date new business volume for 2024 increased by 4.8% from 2023. Adding to the strong industry performance, portfolio quality remains strong with the Index reporting that receivables over 30 days stood at 2.0% in December 2024, down from 2.3% in December 2023 and up slightly from 1.8% in December 2022. The Index further pointed out that much of the new volume growth was due in large part to an increase in bank-owned finance activity, bringing the banks’ share of business volume in December 2024 to 62% of total volume. As banks continue to seek growth and market share in the industry, the prospects for M&A activity improve.

Industry confidence continues to improve as we start 2025 with the Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation reporting that the Monthly Confidence Index for the equipment finance industry increased to 69.6 in January of 2025, up sharply from 48.6 in January 2024, and 48.5 in January 2023. This index, which is designed to reflect a qualitative assessment of industry leaders’ perceptions of current and future business conditions, has not seen the current confidence levels since July of 2021, suggesting that we may have turned the corner on the prospects for sustained economic growth and profitability.

In addition to the strong stock market, low unemployment rate and highest business confidence levels in the past three and a half years, the uncertainty of the 2024 presidential election is now behind us. The new administration’s campaign ran on the promise of promoting a more business-friendly environment through reduced regulations, lower corporate tax rates and reduced pricing for goods and services driven by a more robust energy policy. If the government can deliver on these objectives, it should provide an economic environment that promotes M&A activity in our industry.

Despite the strong industry performance and improving economic environment, a number of factors might challenge the M&A market in 2025. In addition to showing improvement in many areas, the CapEx Finance Index reported that charge-offs reached 0.52% of receivables in December of 2024, up sharply from 0.44% in December of 2023 and 0.27% in December of 2022. Credit approval rates dropped to 74% at the end of 2024, down from 75% for the same period a year ago and 77% in 2022, indicating that applicant credit quality could be starting to deteriorate.

The New York Federal Reserve reported that credit card debt reached $1.166 trillion in the third quarter of 2024, the highest on record since the measurement began. According to BankRate, the average credit card interest rate is 20.14% as of January 2025.

Certain key provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2017 are set to expire at the end of 2025. A number of tax policy changes were included in the bill, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the house, it remains uncertain if the key provisions of the bill will renew or expire. The bill also included a scheduled phase out of bonus depreciation, reducing the deduction from 100% in 2022 by 20% per year until it is entirely phased out in 2027. These factors will continue to create economic uncertainty and could influence the level of M&A activity during 2025.

The new administration is focused on trade and may introduce import tariffs on certain foreign goods being sold in the United States. If import tariffs are implemented, it may take some time to determine the long-term impact — if any — on the supply chain, prices and inflation rates, as well as their effect on equipment demand and the availability of new equipment or parts needed for repairs and maintenance. The Alta Group discusses many of the above factors in its 2025 Insights report, available at thealtagroup.com.

CONCLUSION

Current economic factors on balance would suggest that the industry should expect an improvement in M&A transaction volume in 2025. The uncertainty of the election is behind us, and we are at the beginning stages of a more friendly business environment with an administration promising a reduction in regulations and corporate taxes. Independent equipment finance companies continue to be attractive acquisition targets for investors as they generally provide for an above-average risk-adjusted return over the long term. As we begin 2025, we continue to hear from qualified buyers that they have an interest in acquiring quality finance companies, but these buyers have become much more selective about the market segments and types of equipment finance organizations that would be of greatest interest to them.

Potential sellers still have several reasons to consider a sale in the near term. Many independent finance companies in the industry have aging owners who are beginning to

focus on estate planning and transitioning their businesses to successor firms. Most of these owners understand that they need to start the sale process early as, regardless of their succession plan, they will likely need to continue working at least part-time after the sale to successfully transition the business and achieve the optimal sale price for their company.

Several private equity firms and family wealth funds made initial investments in companies seven to 10 years ago. It is typical for these investors to look to exit their investments during this timeframe to provide their clients with their target returns and provide liquidity to invest in other projects. Since these investors have not feasibly or profitably been able to exit these investments in the past three years, they will likely want to opportunistically test the M&A markets in 2025 to determine if they can successfully exit. A number of strategic finance companies have indicated that they are interested in acquiring lift-out teams that can provide them with access to new business relationships or new market offerings. In fact, several successful lift-outs have already been announced in 2025.

The current challenge, which will likely remain an issue in the early months of 2025, is persistent inflation and the uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s position on the number of and magnitude of rate changes for 2025 to achieve a soft landing and finally get inflation under control. This will remain a key factor in returning to a more robust M&A environment and driving more successful deal flow. •",https://www.monitordaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2446835149-balancing-400.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 16:10:31.442252

Shares of Nike, On Holding, Skechers, Deckers Outdoor and Foot Locker on Wednesday jumped after President Trump authorized a 90-day pause on certain tariffs to most countries, excluding China.

Nike shares traded around 11% higher, with shares of Hoka owner Deckers up 13% and Skechers stock rising around 10% shortly after Trump made the announcement on a post on his Truth Social platform. Shares of on Holding and sports retailer Foot Locker led the gains, rising 15% and 16%, respectively.

Footwear companies' manufacturing operations are heavily dependent on Vietnam, among other Asian countries, and their shares underwent a major selloff after Trump disclosed a new round of tariffs last week that targeted their key suppliers.

For sneaker giant Nike, supply-chain partners in Vietnam and Indonesia make 61% of the sneaker company's manufactured goods. China represents 34% of its manufacturing. On Holding has 90% of its footwear made in Vietnam, according to William Blair.

Analysts had expected significant price increases from retail companies to offset higher costs related to tariffs, coming at a time marked by weakening consumer sentiment amid inflation and unemployment fears.

Despite these constructive developments, the company's share price witnessed a 16% decline over the past week, which aligns with broader market movements influenced by heightened tariff uncertainties. The volatility in the markets, particularly the impact of sweeping tariffs, largely overshadowed UPS's latest product-related announcements, which could have otherwise presented potential growth opportunities in the evolving logistics landscape.

Trump's oil boom is here — pipelines are primed to profit. Discover the 20 US stocks riding the wave.

The recent announcement by United Parcel Service of its new shipping options, UPS Ground Saver and UPS Ground with Freight Pricing, could potentially enhance its competitive position in the logistics sector. This strategic move is anticipated to diversify revenue streams by addressing varied customer needs, although the recent 16% share price decline might shift the focus away from these growth prospects. Considering the company's emphasis on network reconfiguration and efforts to bolster efficiency, there is potential for sustained cost savings and an improvement in operating margins.

Over a longer-term five-year period, UPS's total shareholder return, including dividends, was 8.21%, reflecting a steady, albeit modest, performance. This return period provides context against recent share price movements and broader market declines. However, in the past year, UPS underperformed both the US market, which declined by 5.8%, and the logistics industry, which saw a 30.8% fall, suggesting challenges specific to the sector.

The expansion of shipping options could support positive shifts in revenue and earnings projections if effectively integrated into existing operations. The price movement, leading to a current share price of US$95.56, represents a significant discount to the consensus analyst price target of approximately US$130.07. This presents an interesting scenario for investors assessing market conditions versus analyst expectations, who see a potential uplift, contingent upon execution and macroeconomic factors.

It said ""exploitative"" and ""insidious"" marketing practices online had led to increasing sales of formula, while dissuading mothers from breastfeeding.
INC, which runs the voluntary code of practice for marketing formula in New Zealand, told MPI the guidelines were ""a bit of a shocker"".
The health ministry told RNZ there was no timeline for implementing the new WHO digital marketing code in New Zealand.
The pushback against the WHO guidelines was revealed amid a recent RNZ investigation into a government backdown over trans-Tasman formula guidelines.","Baby formula companies tried to convince the government to resist an expanded global ban on internet marketing of infant milk, despite evidence that online advertising was discouraging mums from breastfeeding.

The former chief executive of the local formula industry body even met with diplomats based at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva to raise its concerns, documents obtained by RNZ under the Official Information Act show.

Meanwhile, French multinational Danone, whose Karicare and Aptamil brands dominate the market in New Zealand, separately told senior ministers that new World Health Organisation (WHO) digital marketing guidelines were ""misguided"" and urged officials not to enshrine them into law.

""A communication blackout will deny New Zealand parents and carers the information to make informed choices on the best nutritional options for their infants,"" Danone wrote.

WHO issued the new guidelines last year, recommending a ban on ""digital"" advertising of all formula - and baby food - for children under three years old, after a review found social media was now the main way parents were exposed to formula marketing.

It said ""exploitative"" and ""insidious"" marketing practices online had led to increasing sales of formula, while dissuading mothers from breastfeeding.

""Through tools like apps, virtual support groups or 'baby-clubs', paid social media influencers, promotions and competitions and advice forums or services, formula milk companies can buy or collect personal information and send personalized promotions to new pregnant women and mothers,"" the WHO report said.

The World Health Assembly is expected to formally adopt the guidelines into its International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes in May.

The New Zealand government's 2023 submission to the draft guidelines - made in consultation with formula companies - did not support the full scope of the proposed rules banning digital marketing of foods for infants and young children, or the expanded definition of breastmilk substitutes covering infants up to three years of age.

New Zealand has been a signatory to the Code since 1983, but only partially complies with it because compliance is based on a voluntary, industry-run code of practice, rather than regulations enshrined in law.

The Code, which is run by industry body the Infant Nutrition Council (INC) and overseen by the Ministry of Health, currently prohibits members from marketing products for infants up to 12 months of age, including digital marketing.

Rules 'misguided'

Documents released to RNZ show that Danone urged senior ministers against adopting the new guidelines into law, despite the company's own 'advocacy policy' stating it supports national legislation that supports the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.

""The guidance is misguided and will have profound consequences for the infant formula industry and consumers,"" Danone New Zealand operations manager Steve Donnelly wrote in a December 2023 letter to Food Safety Minister Andrew Hoggard and Trade and Agriculture Minister Todd McClay.

He urged ministers to apply a ""national interest test"" to the WHO guidance, referring to the National-New Zealand First coalition agreement requiring the government to apply such a test before it accepted any United Nations agreements.

""Our view is that the consequences of the WHO guidelines for breast milk substitute digital marketing are of the national interest and should not be adopted,"" wrote Donnelly.

The guidelines would lead to a ""total ban"" of all digital communications about its products for newborns up to 36-months old, he said.

Even though potential ratification by New Zealand was ""likely years away"" and led by the health ministry he urged the ministers and MPI to ""take an active interest in these developments.""

Danone had also raised its concerns to the Ministry for Primary Industries' Dairy Product Safety Advisory Council (DPSAC) in November 2023, questioning what action the government was taking over the issue.

DPSAC was set up in 1999 to ""promote communication between MPI and industry and assist in developing standards and policies."" Danone has been a member since 2020.

At the time, MPI told Danone the final guidelines had already been issued and there was nothing it could do, documents show.

Danone raised concerns again in April 2024 with Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters.

""Our primary concern is that babies and parents do not become the poor relation of regulation,"" wrote Donnelly.

The letter was forwarded to Associate Health Minister Casey Costello, who oversees maternal health, to respond to.

Her officials noted the guidance issued by WHO was not legally binding, and health, MPI, MFAT and Health NZ would work together to determine ""whether any actions from the guidance will be implemented.""

Costello told Donnelly the government had no plans to change the voluntary INC code of practice currently in place.

""If evidence emerged that suggested New Zealand's current approach does not adequately cover digital marketing practices, then New Zealand may consider measures covered in the guidance,"" she wrote in a June letter.

She would expect the industry to be consulted if changes were proposed, she said.

'A bit of a shocker'

RNZ asked Danone why it was against the new guidance when the current INC code already banned the use of digital marketing.

The company declined to be interviewed, but in a statement said it wrote to senior ministers over the ""concerning language used in the digital marketing guidance which suggested it was mandatory and superseded national laws"".

When asked why it opposed national laws when it was its own policy to support national legislation supporting the WHO code, it responded that it supported the code but the digital marketing guidelines were not yet officially part of it.

""We believe it must be made clear to policymakers that preventing infant formula manufacturers from providing factual information about their products via digital channels may exacerbate existing issues faced by parents and carers, such as the rise of misinformation and unreliable content online,"" it said.

Danone's own 2023 global advocacy policy stated the company would support the WHO code.

""As a first step we will support the adoption, implementation and, critically, enforcement of national legislation to meet the needs of each market.""

It also stated it is ""committed to lobbying only in support of measures to improve health and nutrition, consistent with the public interest and nutrition"".

Danone was not the only organisation opposed to the WHO guidance.

INC, which runs the voluntary code of practice for marketing formula in New Zealand, told MPI the guidelines were ""a bit of a shocker"".

""We think it should not proceed,"" INC policy analyst Carole Inskter told MPI officials in September 2023.

That same month, then-INC chief executive Jan Carey flew to Geneva and met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials based at New Zealand's permanent mission to the World Trade Organisation over the issue.

""From industry's point of view, digital marketing is already covered under the WHO Code including in New Zealand's response which is the INC Code of Practice for the Marketing of Infant Formula in New Zealand,"" she wrote.

The College of Midwives said it would like to see the WHO code enshrined in New Zealand law ""to protect breastfeeding.""

In a 2023 submission to the Commerce Commission about the INC code it raised concerns about New Zealand not fulfilling its obligations under the WHO code.

Legislation would ""support unbiased information about the safe and appropriate use of commercial milk formula for parents and carers,"" it said.

""The marketing of commercial milk formula directly undermines breastfeeding protection.""

The INC Code requires Commerce Commission approval because it brings companies together in a way that could be perceived as collusion.

In February, Australia's competition regulator denied extending the INC's code on that side of the Tasman for another five years over concerns about its voluntary nature, limited scope and ability to restrict digital marketing methods.

Australia's health department has recommended replacing it with a mandatory code, which is expected to take two years to implement.

The health ministry told RNZ there was no timeline for implementing the new WHO digital marketing code in New Zealand.

The pushback against the WHO guidelines was revealed amid a recent RNZ investigation into a government backdown over trans-Tasman formula guidelines.

That investigation found a handful of formula companies, led by Danone and The A2 Milk Company, successfully lobbied against the government adopting tougher trans-Tasman food standards for baby formula.

The companies opposed two labelling rules they claimed would have affected sales and exports to China.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--6bCls33H--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1743725788/4K9H5ZL_infant_formula_03_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-04-09 15:12:07.387179

Two new sports ventures are joining the ION lineup. One is the Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off, an early season college basketball tournament held over Thanksgiving weekend. Scripps Sports has locked up rights for five years from the agency Intersport, which manages the tournament.

Since launching in 2022, the Fort Myers Tip-Off has been a draw for prominent teams, among them South Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, Purdue and others.

Scripps is also teaming with media outlet Sports Illustrated on the SI Women’s Games, a biennial all-star competition featuring elite athletes in six sports. The debut edition is set for Oceanside, CA from October 28 to November 2.

Live women’s sports is a key pillar in the company’s overall strategy, notably the WNBA and the National Women’s Soccer League. Ratings for a range of women’s sports properties have been rising dramatically in recent years, with ad buyers also attracted to the enthusiastic viewership. Rather than devoting resources to originals, ION’s programming budget is mostly targeted to sports, along with the acquired series it programs in prime time.

ION is in the final year of its deal to broadcast Friday night WNBA games. While WNBA rights are part of a broader rights package with NBA games, which are changing partners for the 2025-26 season (with Amazon and NBCUniversal entering the picture with Disney-ESPN), the Friday night slot remains available. ION execs say they are remaining in discussions with the league about continuing as a media partner.

Beyond ION, Scripps also said it had renewed two of its most popular series: Court TV’s Interview with a Killer and Bounce TV’s Mind Your Business.

Interview, a true-crime series hosted by David Scott, became Court TV’s most-watched original when it debuted last fall. The new season will kick off April 13 with a 2-hour episode about Gary Michael Hilton, who calls himself the oldest serial killer in America.

Mind Your Business, which received an NAACP Image Award nomination, is returning for a second season on June 7.

The series focuses on the Williams family, which operates an event and party space in Chicago. Ensemble cast members include Columbus Short (Scandal, Stomp the Yard), Drew Sidora (The Real Housewives of Atlanta, That’s So Raven) and Rolonda Watts (Rolonda).

Companies Looking For Diversifying Operations

In recent years, many leading companies have been diversifying their operations as they face with supply chain disruptions, first due to the COVID and then geopolitical tensions. The companies are trying to diversify business to reduce risk and increase flexibility.

Given its political stability, India has emerged as a favourable place. With a huge market opportunity backed with a dynamic workforce, the companies are considering the country as a one of the best places to set up manufacturing bases.",https://imagesvs.oneindia.com/img/2025/04/hp-laptops-chennai-1744198379.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 16:09:42.884361

The acquisition of Family Dollar by Dollar Tree occurred in 2015 for $9 billion.
The situation is complicated, and many discount chains, including Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, struggle to adapt to a challenging economic environment.
Family Dollar Will Have to Change The future of Family Dollar, now in the hands of Brigade Capital and Macellum Capital, seems to be headed toward a restructuring.
The company's future seems to be centered on its main brand, Dollar Tree, which will continue expanding its store network.","Dollar Tree has taken an unexpected turn by announcing the sale of its Family Dollar chain for $1 billion. This move comes after a series of massive closures that affected more than 1,000 Family Dollar stores in recent months.

The sale will be conducted through a consortium formed by Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management. This operation is an important step in Dollar Tree's restructuring strategy. According to Mike Creedon, the company's CEO, this agreement marks a ""significant milestone"" in their transformation process.

Creedon highlighted that the sale will allow Dollar Tree to focus on its growth and expansion. Especially through its main brand, which already has more than 16,000 stores in the 48 states of the United States.

Dollar Tree Has a Plan

The closure of stores has been a recurring issue for Family Dollar, as in the first half of 2024, the company closed about 600. This was followed by another 370 closures after the expiration of lease contracts. These closures reflect the difficulties Family Dollar faces in keeping competitive in an increasingly demanding discount market.

The acquisition of Family Dollar by Dollar Tree occurred in 2015 for $9 billion. At that time, Dollar Tree sought to expand its presence against its competitor Dollar General. However, Family Dollar's performance was not the desired one.

The high prices of some of its products, along with changes in consumer behavior, have severely affected the brand. Inflation and the decrease in the purchasing power of many customers have been key factors in this debacle.

""The discount store sector faces uncertainty,"" indicated Michael Lasser, an analyst at UBS. The situation is complicated, and many discount chains, including Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, struggle to adapt to a challenging economic environment.

Meanwhile, competitors are also facing their own challenges. The CEO of Dollar General, Todd Vasos, commented that many of their customers can no longer afford products outside of the strictly essential. Inflation has left many shoppers without resources to spend on non-essential products. This has affected sales in several discount chains.

Family Dollar Will Have to Change

The future of Family Dollar, now in the hands of Brigade Capital and Macellum Capital, seems to be headed toward a restructuring. The expectations are that the sale will help stabilize the brand and improve its long-term prospects. Experts point out that this process could offer an opportunity to optimize store operations and reduce costs.

This move also highlights the widespread struggle of many brands in the retail sector. It is estimated that in the coming years up to 45,000 stores will close in the U.S., which highlights the difficulties of traditional commerce against the competition from e-commerce. Large chains like Walmart, Costco, and Target seem to be the ones that will emerge victorious in this new landscape, while others, like Family Dollar, may have to completely reinvent themselves.

Dollar Tree is no stranger to changes. In December 2024, Jeff Davis resigned as the company's CFO, reflecting the internal adjustments Dollar Tree is making to keep competitive. The company's future seems to be centered on its main brand, Dollar Tree, which will continue expanding its store network.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-exterior-dollar-tree-family-dollar-chica-sorprendida-senalando_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-09 15:11:48.940546

While the industry has managed to dodge tariffs for now, the largest companies have lost hundreds of billions in market value in the past month.

Eli Lilly has lost $95.4 billion in market value in just one month. Rival weight loss pharma Novo Nordisk has dropped $72.4 billion in the same time period.

The decline at many of the other top 10 pharmas by market cap was less extreme but equally apparent. AbbVie has lost $52.5 billion in equity value and Johnson & Johnson, the largest healthcare company in the world until recent years, went down by $40.8 billion.

Novo’s shares have seen the steepest decline, with a 21% drop on April 4 that brought the stock down to about $62. The Danish company’s shares peaked at $145 apiece in June 2024. That’s a 51% decline in one year.

Lilly’s stock is still sky-high. The shares were worth about $777 apiece a year ago and closed Tuesday at $730, a 6% decline. But within the past year, the stock has hit as high as $957.

Pharma is not alone in this market misery right now. The S&P 500 has declined 12% in one month and 14% year to date, so every industry is feeling the weight of the macro headwinds.

Jefferies said in an investor note that the tariffs—which have yet to hit pharma specifically—“have triggered a continued flight to safety” in the sector. S&P’s biotech index, the XBI, has dropped nearly 19% in one month and 21% year to date.

Trump has not yet followed through on threats to place tariffs on the pharma industry specifically and the true impact will not be known until he does. Truist Securities analysts said the market damage is already being done. In a note to investors on Monday, they wrote, “We expect to see more volatility in biopharma until greater clarity.”",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/8cf554a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3758x2114+0+77/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2F22%2F0ec0922944b4989aec70abe83ce7%2Fistock-2158575336-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 19:06:35.394537

Kroger said in its 2024 annual report that the company spent $684 million in 2024, $316 million in 2023, and $44 million in 2022. Those costs included “third-party professional fees and credit facility fees …” Kroger said.

And that price tag is still rising as Kroger defends itself in a lawsuit brought by Albertsons that aims to collect on the $600 million termination clause in the contract between the two grocery giants. Albertsons has said it aims to sue for more than just the $600 million.

Kroger also faces a lawsuit from its would-be divestiture partner, C&S Wholesale Grocers, which argues it is owed a $125 million termination fee for the failed deal.

Meanwhile, Kroger is fighting back against both companies, arguing that the two colluded to pressure Kroger to increase the number of stores to divest to C&S Wholesale.

“As detailed in the court filing, while Kroger was working diligently to seek regulatory approval and close the merger, Albertsons was engaging in a secret and misguided campaign, together with C&S Wholesale Grocers, the divestiture buyer, to pursue its own regulatory strategy, which ultimately undermined Kroger's efforts,” the grocer said in the press release.

The price tag for Albertsons has also been steep.

Through June 15, the Boise, Idaho-based grocery retailer had spent $329 million on the merger effort, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

As the companies battle it out in court, Kroger is working to get back on track with opening new locations and renovating existing ones.

In early April, the grocery chain, which operates roughly 2,750 locations under a wide range of banners, including King Soopers, Ralphs, Dillons, Fred Meyer, and others, announced it will spend about $130 million in 2025 to renovate 16 existing stores and build three new stores and four fuel centers.

The new stores will be located in Edgewood and Newport, Kentucky, and Eaton, Ohio, the company said in a press release.

“As the hometown grocer to the Cincinnati/Dayton community we take pride in our ability to improve access to fresh affordable food and always improving the customer experience,” said Ann Reed, president of the Cincinnati/Dayton division, in the press release. “Our investment of $130 million underscores our commitment to our associates, customers and communities while providing a best-in-class shopping experience for everyone.”

Renovations to the 16 stores—located across Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky—are expected to cost about $45 million.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/blt66f79f61422be300/67f6a4e65538ca21ff188d38/kroger-albertson_Logos.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-09 14:10:16.653834

The measures are a response to President Trump's latest round of tariffs, which went into effect overnight, and include a 104% levy on Chinese goods.

The Chinese finance ministry says the new charges will take effect at midnight in China, or Wednesday noon Eastern time.

""The US's practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,"" the ministry said in a statement announcing the fresh round of levies.

China calls on the U.S. to cancel its tariffs against Chinese goods, ""and properly resolve differences with China through equal dialogue on the basis of mutual respect,"" the ministry added.

Hopes had risen among some investors that the U.S. would strike trade deals to lower the tariffs over time, leaving the punitive measures as a temporary negotiating tactic. Trump has signaled he is willing to talk, posting Tuesday on Truth Social that China ""wants to make a deal, badly.""

But Trump's statement was undermined by the new measures, which sent Dow futures down more than 700 points. S&P futures are also down 1.8% and Nasdaq futures tumbled more than 1.4%.

Global stock market slump continues

Stock markets in Europe opened Wednesday with sharp downturns. In London, Frankfurt and Paris, share prices fell once more in early trading Wednesday after recovering some of their value earlier this week. The French and German markets remained almost 12% lower than they were a week ago, when the new tariffs were first announced.

Earlier, many markets across Asia had also slumped, with Japan's Nikkei closing down nearly 4%. South Korea's KOSPI fell 1.74% and Taiwan's composite index shed 5.79%. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index opened down more than 3% before recovering to close up about 1%.

In mainland China, key indexes closed up more than 1%, despite Chinese goods being the hardest hit. The steep new levy was a response to Beijing issuing reciprocal tariffs of 34% on American goods last week.

Other countries try negotiations

Japan is the country with the largest foreign direct investment in the United States and Japanese negotiators are scheduled to hold talks in Washington that could include discussions of foreign currency exchange rates as Trump has accused Tokyo of devaluing the yen to support Japanese exports — something Japan has repeatedly denied.

Trade negotiators from South Korea, another close American trading partner, will also begin talks with the U.S. soon as the government in Seoul announces a series of emergency actions, including subsidies and tax breaks, to support the country's export sectors, including auto manufacturers.

Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister of Vietnam, which has in recent decades become a global center for low-cost manufacturing, will meet with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday to discuss the 46% tariffs placed on its exports to the U.S.

The stock market in Vietnam fell almost 10% on Wednesday, the sharpest in Asia, and during the past week it has fallen almost 20%.

India also said the country is engaging with the United States. India's external affairs minister said on Wednesday that the two countries are hammering out a bilateral trade agreement, which could conclude by the fall of this year.

Recession fears raised further at home

Fears of a U.S. and indeed a wider global recession have been further heightened by the continued volatility of America's stock market since last week.

Alongside that destruction of trillions in corporate value over recent days, government bonds — traditionally considered safer than equities — have also plummeted, while President Trump has confused investors by describing the tariffs as ""permanent,"" while also boasting that global leaders have requested trade negotiations that might include offers to end their own preexisting tariffs or non-trade barriers on U.S. goods.

The U.S.-based investment bank JP Morgan has said its economists estimate there is now a 60% chance that the world could enter a recession by the end of 2025.

Walmart tops all other retailers for online grocery sales with 25.7% of the total market share. Amazon has 22% of the share, and Instacart, which works with dozens of retailers like Aldi, has 21.6% of the share. Kroger has about 9%, and Albertsons has 3.4% according to e-Marketer.

The Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopping Survey, sponsored by Mercatus, found that consumers remain loyal to delivery, with that segment’s sales rising 30% amid an expanding monthly user base.

“Delivery’s remarkable year-over-year rebound highlights the potency of promotional strategies that help customers save more money,” said David Bishop, partner at Brick Meets Click. “And, memberships/subscriptions are becoming essential for retaining customers and driving more recurring revenue via gains in order frequency and average order values.”

The latest monthly performance gains for online grocery sales reflect aggressive promotions and deep discounts on annual memberships and/or subscriptions that began around May 2024, according to the report. The promotions have been offered by a broad range of grocery retailers, including mass retailers like Walmart, supermarkets, and third-party providers like Instacart who have benefits that include free delivery.

March 2025 also marked five years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, which altered how U.S. households purchased their groceries, noted the survey report.

Online grocery sales for delivery totaled $4.2 billion in March, up from $2.5 billion, up 68% over the past five years. Online grocery sales for store pickup totaled $3.8 billion in March, up 58.3% from $2.4 billion when the pandemic started in March 2020. Ship-to-home online grocery orders totaled $1.8 billion in March, rising 12.5% from $1.6 billion five years ago, according to the report.

The report indicated that in August 2019, online grocery rang up $2 billion in monthly sales in the U.S. Then seven months later, in March 2020, online grocery sales skyrocketed to $6.5 billion, a more than 200% increase. This initial surge accounted for about 60% of the total gains for e-grocery since the pandemic. After peaking in early 2021, total e-grocery sales rebalanced through mid-2024, contributing another 20% of overall gains. More recently, there has been another 20% in gains driven by the uptick in subscriptions and memberships promotions, with March 2025 representing the 8th consecutive month of sales of over $9.5 billion, the report notes.

The report notes that while the pandemic motivated more households to try online grocery shopping, the share of consumers who now regularly shop for groceries online has risen from 25% to 57% over the past five years. The report also found that consumers are shopping more often, with 2.6 average online grocery orders per month, up from an average of two orders per month during the pandemic.

And it wrote down its insurance broking business by £138.3m following a £104m write-down in goodwill for the same operation in 2023, as post-tax losses surpassed £100m for a second consecutive year.
Saga completed 30,000 PMI policy sales in 2024 through its broking arm, down 9% from the 33,000 it reported in 2023.
When combined with its travel insurance sales, which also fell by 10.3%, gross written premiums for the two businesses fell by 6.3% to £125.5m from £134m.
And it reported restructuring costs of £32.2m, including the expected costs of restructuring insurance broking operations, ahead of the Ageas partnership becoming operational.","Saga’s private medical insurance (PMI) sales fell almost 10% in 2024 as the group which specialises in products for people over 50 said it faced tough competition and tighter margins.

The group also paid a £2.6m share of profit to Axa Health after it ended the solus supplier contract with the insurer for health cover to replace it with Bupa.

And it wrote down its insurance broking business by £138.3m following a £104m write-down in goodwill for the same operation in 2023, as post-tax losses surpassed £100m for a second consecutive year.

Saga completed 30,000 PMI policy sales in 2024 through its broking arm, down 9% from the 33,000 it reported in 2023.

It also cited lower renewal margins on PMI which further reduced the revenue and profitability of the operation.

“While sales of PMI reduced slightly, there were net rate inflation pressures in the current year, reducing renewal margins and leading to written gross profit after marketing expenses decreasing by £3.5m,” it said.

When combined with its travel insurance sales, which also fell by 10.3%, gross written premiums for the two businesses fell by 6.3% to £125.5m from £134m.

The firm also operates a general insurance arm for home and motor insurance which it underwrote but is in the middle of completing a sell-off to Ageas.

Post-tax losses break £100m again

Overall, the group saw its after-tax loss grow to £164.9m a 46% increase on the £113m post-tax loss made in 2023.

This included the £138.3m impairment to insurance broking goodwill, which was an addition to the £104m write-down it made to the same business a year earlier.

There were other exceptional items totalling £50.6m which included a £30.8m write-down to software assets “that will no longer drive economic benefit to the group following the transition to the insurance broking partnership with Ageas”.

And it reported restructuring costs of £32.2m, including the expected costs of restructuring insurance broking operations, ahead of the Ageas partnership becoming operational.

The group’s underlying profit before tax of £47.8m was up from £38.2m primarily due to a £23.6m increase in its travel operations which arrange cruises and other trips and insurance underwriting growing by £12m to £10.7m.

Saga group chief executive officer Mike Hazell said he was “very pleased” with the progress it has made over the past 12 months and that it “delivered a strong performance” from a trading perspective.

“This was driven by the strength of our travel businesses, with especially high levels of customer demand for our differentiated ocean and river cruise offers,” he said.

“In addition, we took the significant strategic action necessary to reposition the group for future growth. We completed our strategic review, successfully signed a new 20-year insurance broking partnership with wholly owned UK subsidiaries of Ageas SA/NV and agreed the sale of our insurance underwriting business.

“These achievements materially reduce the risk and complexity of the insurance business going forward and, when combined with our continued strong trading performance, meant that we were able to complete the refinancing of our long-term corporate debt, replacing our 2026 debt maturities with new long-term credit facilities.”

Director departures

Two directors are leaving the board as a result of the Ageas deals to “reflect the group’s new simplified business model” it said.

Executive director Steve Kingshott and senior independent director Sir Peter Bazalgette have left from today.

Sir Peter is chairman of the nomination committee and is also a member of the remuneration committee. Gareth Hoskin will replace Sir Peter as senior independent director, chairman of the nomination committee and as a member of the remuneration committee.

The additions build on Scripps Sports’ national partnerships with the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL).

It also has local partnerships with the National Hockey League’s (NHL) 2024 Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers, the 2023 Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights, the new Utah Hockey Club, the Las Vegas Aces of the WNBA, and the NCAA’s Big Sky Conference.

During a keynote at the recent TV Tech Summit, Scripps Sports President Brian Lawlor discussed how the growing interest in women's sports has had a positive impact on the new sports network and their plans to expand their rights for women’s sports.

In its newest deals, Scripps Sports announced that ION, which is owned by Scripps, will be the exclusive television home of the popular Elevance Health Women’s Fort Myers Tip-Off, a premier early season college basketball tournament. The deal covers the next five years as part of a new multiyear agreement between Scripps Sports and Intersport, which manages the tournament.

The agreement begins with this year’s edition of the Thanksgiving weekend tournament, Nov. 28-29, held at Suncoast Credit Union Arena on the campus of Florida SouthWestern State College in Fort Myers. ION will air every matchup live both days with distribution on cable, satellite, major streaming platforms and over-the-air.

The tournament marks the first national women’s college basketball rights deal for Scripps Sports.

In a separate announcement, Sports Illustrated announced an all-new, biennial all-star competition featuring elite athletes across six sports. The participating athletes will have an opportunity to earn prize money based on competition results, while competing for the title of SI Women’s Games Champion.

For the competition, Sports Illustrated has entered a multi-year partnership with Scripps Sports for ION to be the exclusive U.S. broadcast home of the SI Women’s Games. The Games will also be captured and covered across SI’s digital, video and social media channels.

“The SI Women’s Games are a groundbreaking opportunity to do what we have always done at Sports Illustrated,” said Sports Illustrated editor in chief Steve Cannella. “This is an exciting new way for us to tell the best stories in sports. We can’t wait to watch these incredible athletes compete in California and celebrate everything they do, both on and off the field.”

“We’re proud to partner with Sports Illustrated, one of the most iconic brands in sports, to showcase and bring the compelling and exciting stories, athletes and events of the SI Women’s Games to every American household,” added Lawlor at Scripps Sports. “This is another milestone for Scripps Sports and ION as a premier destination for the best in women’s sports.”",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsLm2Wp8NUuaBiyAGnhP9A-1200-80.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 14:10:58.490435

Analysts warn that German car manufacturers are likely to be the most exposed to the U.S. trade measures.

An escalating trade war is expected to have a profound impact on the global car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains.

Europe's auto giants slipped on Wednesday, extending recent losses as U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries came into effect — including a whopping 104% levy on China.

Trump's latest trade measures, which came into force as of 5 a.m. London time, include a 20% tariff on the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan and a 49% levy on Cambodia.

China responded to Trump's tariff policies by hiking its levies on U.S. imports to 84%, with the duties set to take effect from April 10.

Shares of French car parts supplier Valeo traded down 7.1% on Wednesday, tumbling toward the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.

Germany's Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW fell around 2%, with the latter notching a fresh 52-week low.

Money Report

In Asia, Japan's Nissan and Toyota fell 7% and 2.6%, respectively.

Trump's ""reciprocal"" trade measures will be applied separately and not on top of existing U.S. auto tariffs, according to S&P Global.

The U.S. implemented a 25% charge on all foreign cars imported into the country last Thursday. The White House said it also intends to place tariffs on some auto parts no later than May 3.

Analysts warn that German car manufacturers are likely to be the most exposed to the U.S. trade measures.

""The tariffs are a blow for especially the German car makers which export hundreds of thousands of units to the US annually (749,000 in 2024) and produce many cars in the US itself which require European parts,"" Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC in emailed comments.

""It's hard to work around the tariffs, and they seem to stay at least a while, so they need to deal with it and will have to reconsider product offerings, pricing and manufacturing footprints,"" he added.

An escalating trade war is expected to have a profound impact on the global car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.

In the days since Trump's auto tariffs came into effect, car giants have responded by announcing plans to raise prices, impose import fees, pause shipments, idle plants and even lay off staff.

ING's Luman said that, while a drop in U.S. unit sales will likely hurt German carmakers amid an already complex set of challenges, this picture ""doesn't look dramatic"" just yet.

""China is indeed even more important, and their home market require more attention,"" Luman said. ""I would say that bolstering competitive strength and selling more cars in the European home market (and perhaps develop other export markets across the world) will be the focus.""

Tariff exposure

""BMW and Mercedes are among the top exporters of cars by value from the US, thus the most exposed to retaliatory tariffs among the European automakers,"" Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC by email.

She added that both companies could face double tariffs on vehciles manufactured in Mexico and Canada.

""However, we think most of the models that these companies manufacture in Mexico or Canada can easily be substituted with vehicles imported from Europe, which attract only the worldwide 25% auto tariff,"" she added.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2025/04/108124406-1743531823759-gettyimages-2207473795-_C3A5584CR2.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-04-09 16:10:26.407587

Volkswagen EV sales double in Europe in the first quarter

Volkswagen delivered 216,800 all-electric vehicles globally in the first quarter, up 59% from 136,400 last year. The growth bumped up Volkswagen’s global EV market share from 6% to 10%.

Strong growth in Europe and the US helped offset fewer deliveries in China. In Europe, Volkswagen delivered over 150,000 EVs through the first three months of 2025, more than double (+113%) the number it handed over in the year prior.

Volkswagen is the “clear BEV market leader in Europe” with around 26% of the market. In comparison, Tesla’s sales were down in every European market in Q1, except the UK.

In Germany alone, almost every second EV came from a VW Group brand. With new models like the ID.7 Tourer and Audi Q6 e-tron, Volkswagen’s orders in Western Europe are back up around one million (980,000).

Volkswagen’s top five best-selling EVs globally were the ID.4 and ID.5 (43,700), ID.3 (28,100), Audi A4 e-tron (22,800), Škoda Enyaq (20,200), and ID.7 (19,100).

Global BEV deliveries rise but slip in China

In the US, VW Group EV sales were up 51%. The VW ID.4 was one of the top-selling EVs in the first quarter, with 7,663 units sold. Its electric minibus, the ID.Buzz is now rolling out, with 1,901 units sold in Q1.

Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said, “Now we’re shifting into the fast lane” with new models arriving. The company expects “additional tailwinds” from new model launches in 2025.

Despite growth in Europe and the US, Volkswagen is still struggling to keep pace with BYD and others in China. Volkswagen blamed an “intense competitive situation in China” after EV deliveries fell 37% to 25,900, down from 41,000 last year.

After surpassing VW as the top-selling car brand in China last year, BYD’s impressive sales run is heating up in 2025.

BYD sold 166,109 electric cars last month alone. Through the first three months of 2025, the Chinese EV giant has sold 416,388 all-electric vehicles.

After cutting prices this month on some of its top-selling models, BYD’s cheapest EV, the Seagull, now starts at under $8,000 (56,800 yuan).

For the full fiscal year, Levi’s expects net revenues to decline 1% to 2%, the company previously said.
If price changes seem necessary to blunt the effect of tariffs, they “will be very surgical,” Gass said.
Levi’s “delivered a strong beat in 1Q, while speaking to consistent/accelerating demand over the past few months.","Dive Brief:

Levi Strauss & Co. is still evaluating the implications of tariffs, and executives compared the challenge to the pandemic. On a call with analysts this week, they emphasized a diverse supply chain, with about 1% sourcing from China, about 5% from Mexico and mid- to high-single-digits from Vietnam.

The levies are hitting the denim brand at a time of strength, with Q1 net revenues up 3.1% year over year to $1.5 billion. DTC rose 9% and delivered 52% of total net revenues, and wholesale fell 3%. The Levi’s brands (which include Levi's, Levi Strauss Signature and Denizens) rose 3% and were the bulk of total net revenues, as Beyond Yoga rose 9.8% to $35.2 million. Dockers, likely to be sold, was considered ""discontinued operations.”

Gross margin expanded 330 basis points to 62.1%, and the company swung into the black with $135 million in net income, from its $10.6 million loss a year ago. Inventory was up 7%, and most inventory needed for Q2 U.S. orders has been secured.

Dive Insight:

Levi’s has been cutting back on promotions lately, but pricing is one of the levers, along with managing costs and working with vendors, that could help the brand blunt the effect of tariffs on the economy and its business, Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass and Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh told analysts. They emphasized that the situation is “fluid” and “dynamic,” which makes it uncertain.

Because of the unknowns, the company is not embedding any impact from tariffs in its full year or Q2 guidance, Singh said. For the full fiscal year, Levi’s expects net revenues to decline 1% to 2%, the company previously said.

“It's all being planned right now,” he said. “I think the best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is 2020 and ’21, which was COVID.”

The Levi’s brand enjoys pricing power, and in Q1 average retail prices rose again. After pulling back on promotions, the company enjoyed more full-price selling. If price changes seem necessary to blunt the effect of tariffs, they “will be very surgical,” Gass said.

The international business is so strong that it could mitigate any weakness in U.S. sales, Singh said. Nearly 60% of the company’s revenue comes from outside the U.S., according to Gass.

The company beat expectations in the quarter, Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow said in a research note following the brand’s report. “No slowdown here,” Boruchow said. Levi’s “delivered a strong beat in 1Q, while speaking to consistent/accelerating demand over the past few months.

'As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,' said Joyner. 'Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.

'CVS Health has every opportunity to deliver simply better health, and that starts with the patient-medical professional relationship. I am committed to making sure we do all we can to improve the experience and outcome of every person we serve.'

The company’s cancellations of the orders came without warning and didn’t mention tariffs, but their timing suggests they came in response to the tariffs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (April 9), citing unnamed sources and a document it had seen.

It’s not known how widespread Amazon’s cancellations of orders are, according to the report. The report cited one vendor who said the company canceled a $500,000 order, and an eCommerce consultant who said Amazon canceled orders from “several” clients.

Amazon did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comments.

About 40% of the products sold on the company’s website are purchased by Amazon directly from vendors, while the remainder are listed on its site by third-party sellers, according to the report.

Tariffs were one of several factors that led Amazon and rival retailer Walmart to lower their first-quarter outlooks in February, PYMNTS reported at the time. The companies said other factors contributing to the weak guidance included inflation, weak consumer demand, foreign exchange challenges and a shift in consumer focus toward essentials.

On Wednesday, Walmart retracted its first-quarter operating income outlook due in part to tariff-related concerns. The company said in a press release that it wants to “maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented.”

The announcement came on the same day that Trump’s tariffs went into effect, impacting some of the nations that Walmart relies on to source its goods.

Hackers breach US bank regulator’s email system for more than a year

Hackers infiltrated the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a key US bank regulator, and gained access to highly sensitive financial information for more than a year by compromising an administrator’s email account, as reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday, citing anonymous sources and a draft letter to Congress obtained by the news agency.

According to Bloomberg’s sources and details from the letter, the hackers gained access to an administrator’s account at the OCC, allowing them to monitor staff communications and access around 150,000 emails from May 2023 until they were discovered earlier this year.

The identity of those behind the OCC breach remains unclear.

On February 26, the agency disclosed a “cyber security incident” linked to an administrative account within its email system, which it had uncovered earlier that month. It said that a “limited number of affected email accounts” had been identified and subsequently disabled.

“Earlier this year, the OCC discovered unauthorised access to a limited number of its executives’ and employees’ emails that contain highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in its examinations and supervisory oversight processes,” OCC chief information officer Kristen Baldwin wrote in the draft letter.

The OCC has reported the breach to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. In its initial disclosure, the regulator noted there was no sign of any impact on the financial sector “at this time”.

Barclays scraps diversity targets in the US

Barclays is scrapping its diversity, equity and inclusion targets within its US operations, the bank said on Tuesday, following a policy review prompted by political pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has signed a raft of executive orders aimed at ending government support for such programmes.

The changes include ending targets such as having women occupy 33 per cent of director and managing director roles by the end of 2025, and increasing ethnic minority representation in senior US roles by 50 per cent.

The move comes just months after chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan publicly reaffirmed the bank’s “enduring and unwavering” commitment to DEI.

In a memo seen and reported on by Bloomberg, Venkatakrishnan said: “The group executive committee has been carefully considering the changed environment in the US.

“As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

Barclays said its diversity targets would continue to apply in the UK and other markets.

Swiss regulator backs UBS plan to cap investment bank size

Stefan Walter, chief executive of Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority, has declared his approval of UBS’s proposal to restrict its investment bank’s size.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Walter said ‘“UBS has said that it would limit the size of the investment bank as a proportion of risk-weighted assets. We welcome that of course.”

Switzerland’s parliament is expected to begin debating legislation this year that could require UBS to hold up to $25bn in additional capital, a proposal the bank has strongly criticised. As one potential concession, UBS executives have suggested that the investment bank cap be written into Swiss law.

UBS’s investment banking division is already subject to a self-imposed cap, limited to 25 per cent of the bank’s risk-weighted assets. The move could help ease regulator concerns that higher-risk investment banking activities could trigger a crisis that would ultimately require state intervention.

Revolut fined €3.5mn in Lithuania over money laundering handling

Financial regulators in Lithuania have fined Revolut €3.5mn over its inadequate handling of money laundering activities.

The Bank of Lithuania, the monetary authority that issued the fine, said the penalty was due to insufficient monitoring that led to “the bank not always properly identifying suspicious monetary operations or transactions carried out by customers”.

The penalty comes as digital banks face growing scrutiny over alleged shortcomings in conducting proper checks on new customers and preventing financial crime. In 2024, Starling Bank was fined £29mn by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority for deficiencies in its screening of high-risk customers.

Kroger poured more than $1 billion over three years into its unsuccessful quest to combine with rival Albertsons, the supermarket chain disclosed in a regulatory filing last week.

The expenses primarily consisted of third-party professional fees and credit facility fees Kroger incurred as it sought to obtain regulatory approval for the proposed merger, which drew fierce opposition from the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general on the grounds that it would be anticompetitive.

In its annual 10-K report for 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger said it recorded $684 million in merger-related costs last year. That amount was on top of $316 million the company spent on fees and other expenses related to the merger in 2023, as well as $44 million it devoted to the deal in 2022.

Kroger also said it took on $34 million in interest expenses in 2024 related to $10.5 billion the company borrowed in preparation for its acquisition of Albertsons. Kroger directed the bulk of the borrowed funds to the share-buyback program it implemented after the merger fell apart.

Kroger and Albertsons announced their intention to combine in a deal valued at $24.6 billion in October 2022, sparking swift and loud blowback from a range of foes that included labor groups and politicians as well as government antitrust officials. The FTC sought a federal court order to stop the merger, while the attorneys general of Washington state and Colorado asked state courts to block the deal. On Dec. 10, a federal judge granted the FTC’s request to halt the deal and a judge in Washington also ruled against the merger.

Kroger now faces the cost of defending itself against a lawsuit Albertsons filed accusing it of sabotaging the merger by not taking more aggressive steps to assuage the FTC’s concern that the deal would have created an overly powerful supermarket company. Albertsons is also seeking to collect a $600 million termination fee from Kroger.

Meanwhile, C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had agreed to acquire almost 600 grocery stores as part of a divestiture deal related to the merger, wants a $125 million termination fee. Kroger contends that Albertsons and C&S forfeited those fees, which were specified in the merger agreement, because they took actions that went afoul of the deal’s terms.

As of this month, the coffeehouse has cut several of its items. These include blended Frappuccinos, the Royal English Breakfast Latte and the White Hot Chocolate.

“These items aren’t commonly purchased, can be complex to make or are like other beverages on our menu,” Starbucks wrote on their website. The company said it wants to, “focus on fewer, more popular items,” in hopes of decreasing wait times and enhancing the overall quality and consistency of its service. The company expects to cut up to 30% of offered items before Oct. 1, when its next fiscal year begins.

People have given mixed reviews on the changes so far.

“There is a surplus of drinks on the menu and focusing on perfecting and enhancing a select few would improve their quality,” Nyla Bowers, a sophomore economics major, said.

Nicole Thomas, a sophomore English and Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies double major, said so far the menu change doesn’t affect her.

“A deal breaker would be them not serving anything chai,” Thomas said.

The new Starbucks CEO, Brian Niccol, was brought in to reinvigorate the global chain, but its stock continues to slide. On Tuesday, March 18, Starbucks closed at $98.28, down 1.3% from the $99.58 close on Tuesday, March 11.

The Seattle-based company laid off 1,100 corporate employees and employees affected were notified on February 25.

Niccol released a Global Support Partner announcement message, which said, “We are simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams. Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration,” Niccol said.

More than 25 consumer brandsare linked to oil and gas fracking in the Permian Basin due to their sourcing of fossil-fuel derived plastic packaging, according to a new investigation by the climate group Stand.earth and the Center for International Environmental Law.

The brands include 26 household names such as Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and Walmart. Many of these brands or their parent companies, including P & G, PepsiCo, L’Oréal, the Coca-Cola Company, Unilever, and Nestlé, had previously pledged to reduce their use of virgin plastic in favor of more sustainable alternatives.

Stand.earth also used the findings to build a “Fracked Plastics Map”— an interactive tool linking consumer brands to packing companies, plastics producers and fracking companies that extract petroleum from the Permian Basin. The map reveals that just three companies — Dow, Ineos and Reliance — supply the plastic to the 26 brands for their packaging.

Dive Insight:

It was estimated that more than 500 million metric tons of plastic would be consumed last year, with most of this quickly becoming waste, according to the United Nations International Governing Committee on Plastic Pollution.

The Committee estimated that nearly all (98%) of single-use plastic products are produced from fossil fuel rather than recycled plastic. By 2040, greenhouse gas emissions associated with such products will make up 19% of the global carbon emissions budget, or the amount of carbon emissions that will keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to the Committee.

Stand.earth’s investigation used customs data, export/import data, company 10-K filings, supplier disclosure documents and investor presentations to trace supply chains for such single-use plastic packaging, per the April 1 press release. The report focused exclusively on packaging made of polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, which in turn was derived from ethane extracted in the Permian Basin, Stand.earth said in an email to ESG Dive. The investigation was not able to quantify volumes of single-use plastics bought by each company because this is proprietary information, Stand.earth said in the email.

However, of the companies investigated, the Coca-Cola Company had the most supply-chain connections to petrochemical companies, with 10 links identified. Other companies with a high number of links were Unilever, Nestlé and PepsiCo, Stand.earth told ESG Dive. These are the same four companies that generate the most plastic pollution worldwide, according to a 2023 audit by the global coalition Break Free From Plastic.

The investigation highlights the role of plastics in the global climate crisis, Stand.earth Investigative Researcher Devyani Singh said in the press release.

“While much of the climate conversation focuses on transportation and energy, petrochemicals are quietly becoming the biggest driver of fossil fuel demand,” Singh said. “This research pulls back the curtain on the hidden supply chains behind plastic production, exposing the corporations fueling both the plastic and climate crises.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/NyT6zhNWCOTG4XGxlO9QbzwmgPcNwkjJtx6SviCBANI/g:nowe:0:160/c:2997:1693/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy00NjI4NDM1NDZfRjhnQUhUOS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-09 16:09:46.293094

Where it stands: So far, the presence of robotaxis in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix hasn't affected ride-hailing drivers much, Gridwise found.
Entrepreneurial drivers could run an entire fleet of robotaxis on Lyft.","As robotaxi services begin to spread across America, ride-hailing drivers could worry that they'll be pushed aside in favor of robots — or at least that their incomes will shrink.

Why it matters: Like manufacturing, retailing and other industries, transportation is a prime target for automation.

Reality check: Cashiers aren't going away, and neither are factory workers or Uber drivers.

Instead, they'll work alongside robots for the foreseeable future.

Driving the news: Uber and Lyft are starting to offer robotaxis as a ride option in select cities, joining Waymo, which is already in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

In the beginning, these robotaxis will be confined to certain neighborhoods and will only operate in optimal conditions.

But they'll help Uber and Lyft manage their networks more efficiently, such as during peak demand when prices often surge.

Longer term, as technology advances and costs come down, robotaxis could also mean cheaper fares for riders.

By the numbers: Uber controls about 75% of the U.S. ride-hailing market; Lyft owns the rest.

Drivers on both networks earn about $23 per hour, according to Gridwise Analytics, which collects driver data to track the gig economy.

Uber drivers earn an average of $513 per week, while Lyft drivers gross $318.

Where it stands: So far, the presence of robotaxis in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix hasn't affected ride-hailing drivers much, Gridwise found.

""Drivers are still working at the same pace, getting the same incentives, and taking as many trips as before,"" co-founder and CEO Ryan Green tells Axios.

The big picture: The hassles and costs of owning a car in urban areas have fueled the growth of ride-hailing platforms, especially among younger people.

That growth is expected to accelerate sharply over the next 15 years, as more people turn to ride-hailing for their daily commutes instead of just occasional use, say forecasters at S&P Global Mobility.

""Gen Z and Gen Alpha have a different mindset when it comes to mobility,"" Mario Franjicevic, a principal research analyst at the firm, tells Axios.

""They don't own CDs or vinyl. They don't own DVDs. They subscribe to Netflix and Spotify. They will do the same with mobility. Owning a car is not a status symbol to them.""

By 2040, S&P Global Mobility is projecting 15 billion ride-hailing trips a year in the U.S., up from 3.6 billion in 2024.

The intrigue: About half of those trips will be in robotaxis; the other half will still be driven by humans.

Between the lines: Jeremy Bird, Lyft's executive vice president of driver experience, described three phases of the robotaxi transition in a recent blog post.

Adoption: Robotaxis are still a novelty. There aren't enough of them to meet a city's transportation needs, and they can't operate in certain weather conditions or on certain roads. (That's where we are today.)

Hybrid network: Some riders will select robotaxis, but others will still prefer a human driver for extra assistance or premium service.

Lyft-ready network: Anyone's automated car can be deployed on the ride-hailing network to generate income when they're not using it.

This annual United Nations observance day, established in 1993, highlights the importance of freshwater, and raises awareness about the 2.2 billion people worldwide living without access to safe water.

The brewery’s half-day event was hosted by the senior leadership team and attended by key stakeholders, including government officials, local media, strategic suppliers, and NGOs.

By aligning their event with World Water Day, Accra Brewery PLC demonstrated their commitment to addressing global water challenges while highlighting their own sustainable water management practices to stakeholders and industry partners.

Solomon Ayiah, Head of Legal and Corporate Affairs at Accra Brewery PLC said, “Beer is made of natural ingredients, with water being essential to both our beer and our business. We rely on farmers, clean water, healthy communities, strong suppliers and thriving natural ecosystems.

“Water is the number one ingredient in beer and a key resource in the communities where we live and work. As one of Ghana’s leading brewers, we are focused on finding solutions to global water challenges across our communities and supply chains.”

Diaan Kruger, Country Director at Accra Brewery added, “AB InBev is taking steps to reduce water usage by responsibly managing water consumption and discharge across its operations and supply chain.

“We are constantly innovating to reduce water use in our operations and, over the past year, have improved our water use efficiency by approximately 15%. However, we are not stopping there as we see our evolution as a journey of continuous improvement.”

As a responsible steward of Africa’s natural resources, Accra Brewery PLC is committed to ethical supply chain operations. The brewery’s dedication extends beyond its operations, ensuring a positive impact on the local economy while prioritising environmental responsibility. The World Water Day event provided a platform to showcase its commitment to water conservation excellence and reaffirmed the brewery’s role in protecting this essential resource for future generations.

AB InBev has implemented key water stewardship initiatives across all zones that are making a positive impact in local communities. Throughout its business operations worldwide, the company has compelling stories to share about its strong water stewardship efforts. These efforts include the automation of raw water tanks to prevent overflow, water recycling, automated water collection and water saving borehole installation and a range of other smart technologies.

“By highlighting our innovative approaches and measurable achievements in water management, we have strengthened our reputation as responsible stewards of natural resources. The event’s interactive demonstrations and brewery tour highlight AB InBev’s efforts towards providing all stakeholders, including media and the public a transparent view of our hands-on commitment to conservation efforts that benefit the entire country.

“The compelling data presented throughout the tour resonated strongly with attendees, generating positive feedback and meaningful dialogue about future collaborations. The event also provided an opportunity for key stakeholders to sign our pledge board, demonstrating their commitment to efficient water usage,” said Ayiah.

With growing global concerns about water scarcity, Accra Brewery PLC recognises its responsibility as a major consumer of water to lead by example in adopting sustainable practices.

“We continue to work toward our 2025 Sustainability Goals and our ambition to achieve net zero by 2040 across our value chain. We remain committed to continuous improvement as we work toward our goal of becoming the industry’s most water-efficient brewery by 2030,” said Kruger.

Apple ended the quarter with a market share of 8.7%.
ASUS also stood out, growing shipments by more than 11.1% to capture a 6.3% market share.
Meanwhile, smaller manufacturers categorized under “Others” saw a collective decline of 3.6%, indicating that market share is consolidating toward larger, more resilient players.
Bottom Line The PC market showed strong early traction in 2025, but the underlying picture is anything but stable.","The global PC market started 2025 on a strong note, with first-quarter shipments increasing 4.9% year over year to 63.2 million units, according to the data compiled by International Data Corporation (“IDC”). The data was impressive and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. However, the near-term prospects of the PC industry seem highly volatile, given an uncertain environment triggered by the U.S. government’s new tariff policies, inflationary concerns and shifting PC upgrade cycles.

First-Quarter Growth: A Pre-Tariff Rush

At first glance, the first-quarter shipment data suggests strong momentum in the PC space. However, much of this growth appears to be driven by strategic stockpiling by vendors and buyers to have front-loaded orders ahead of new tariffs announced by the U.S. government in early April, according to IDC. These tariffs, which are expected to directly impact hardware imports from China, could raise costs for both suppliers and end-users in the coming quarters.

Per IDC, many players in the PC supply chain made calculated decisions to accelerate shipments in the first quarter to avoid additional tariff pressure. This makes the first quarter look stronger than it might have otherwise been. However, this elevated first-quarter performance has introduced uncertainty about how the rest of the year will unfold once the full impact of the tariffs takes hold.

Commercial Demand Still Intact

Though the first-quarter performance benefited from a pre-tariff stockpiling strategy, there are signs that some underlying drivers of PC demand remain healthy, particularly for commercial PCs. The demand for commercial PCs is likely to be driven by two structural tailwinds.

First, businesses are likely to refresh PCs ahead of the end of Microsoft’s Windows 10 support in October 2025. Second, rising interest in PCs equipped with on-device AI capabilities could be a major demand booster for the PC industry.

These trends have helped sustain steady demand in the first quarter. It is most likely that even if consumer sentiment weakens due to pricing pressure, the enterprise refresh cycle and AI-enabled device innovation could provide some insulation for PC manufacturers.

Vendor Performance and Market Share

Among the top five vendors, Lenovo LNVGY retained its market-leading position with 15.2 million shipments and a 24.1% market share, up from 22.8% in the same period last year. HP Inc. HPQ followed with 12.8 million shipments, gaining modestly from last year, while Dell Technologies DELL posted a smaller increase of 3% to reach 9.6 million units. HP and Dell Technologies had a market share of 20.2% and 15.1%, respectively.

Apple AAPL, however, stole the spotlight with the highest growth among the top players. Its first-quarter shipments surged 14.1% year over year, reaching 5.5 million units. Apple ended the quarter with a market share of 8.7%.

ASUS also stood out, growing shipments by more than 11.1% to capture a 6.3% market share. Meanwhile, smaller manufacturers categorized under “Others” saw a collective decline of 3.6%, indicating that market share is consolidating toward larger, more resilient players.

What’s Ahead for the PC Industry?

The April 2 announcement of new U.S. tariffs has introduced a wave of uncertainty. As of now, companies have yet to fully respond, but Ryan Reith, group vice president of IDC's Worldwide Device Trackers, believes it's only a matter of time before strategies shift. Vendors would start evaluating multiple options like relocating manufacturing, adjusting inventories or negotiating trade exemptions. However, Ryan opines that no matter what approach vendors would undertake, it is most likely that cost increases will ultimately hit consumers and enterprise buyers.

That raises the risk of delayed purchases in the coming quarters. If hardware becomes more expensive and economic sentiment weakens further, even a strong commercial refresh cycle may not be enough to sustain demand at the first-quarter levels.

Bottom Line

The PC market showed strong early traction in 2025, but the underlying picture is anything but stable. The pre-tariff inventory pull-in inflated first-quarter numbers and cast a shadow over the rest of the year. Investors should expect heightened uncertainty as the effects of tariffs begin to bite, especially if inflation and macro risks escalate.

The chain was named on a list of companies that support Israel, but Starbucks denied that claim.
Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector.
Starbucks brought on Niccol as the new CEO last year, and he’s been tasked with bringing customers back to the coffee chain.
Starbucks’ menu has also been simplified, getting back to the basics in coffee.","Starbucks is looking to rebound after a drop in UK sales last year amid false accusations. The company reported a 4% decrease in the UK last year, citing a “challenging consumer environment.” It comes after Starbucks faced a boycott during the Israel-Hamas war last year, which executives say was a misconception.

The chain was named on a list of companies that support Israel, but Starbucks denied that claim. The company said in response to the list at the time: “We have no political agenda. We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere — and never have.”

CEO Brian Niccol told Bloomberg at the time: ""The boycott and that whole information cycle, it's really unfortunate.

It comes after Trump had a bizarre brain collapse in Biden-esque moment' while speaking for almost an hour on Wednesday, sparking health fears after yet another strange moment.

But it wasn’t just the boycotts. The chain has been hit with inflationary pressures as the cost of living continues to rise.

Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macroeconomic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.”

But the UK isn’t the only place where the company is looking to bounce back. Starbucks brought on Niccol as the new CEO last year, and he’s been tasked with bringing customers back to the coffee chain.

He recently announced baristas will now see new speed goals when it comes to preparing orders, in an effort to cut down on consumer wait times.

Capgemini expands strategic partnership with Google Cloud to revolutionize CX across industries with agentic AI

Paris, April 9, 2025 – Capgemini today announced a strategic agentic AI initiative with Google Cloud to transform customer experience (CX) into a key value driver for clients. Building on its existing partnership, Capgemini will create industry-specific agentic AI solutions designed to handle customer requests across all communication channels (web, social, phone etc.) and improve employee productivity. Underpinned by Google Cloud’s AI technology, Capgemini will develop bespoke solutions designed to enhance customer services with intelligent automation and deep customer insights, enabling organizations to deliver more personalized, efficient, and effective CX to elevate brand perception, increase loyalty, and drive revenue growth.

A recent report by the Capgemini Research Institute found that although customer service is considered strategically important, less than half of organizations feel prepared to integrate AI and generative AI into the function.1 Recognized as the Global Industry Solution Partner of the Year 2025 by Google Cloud, Capgemini will combine its deep industry expertise and technical capabilities to develop solutions powered by Google Agentspace and Customer Engagement Suite with Google AI. This will accelerate adoption of secure, trusted agentic AI capabilities that are interoperable with a client’s existing technology infrastructure and can support a variety of industry and regulatory needs. The agentic AI solutions will be designed to significantly optimize business processes and unlock commercial value by enhancing organizations’ own search capabilities, automating complex workflows, as well as understanding and proactively anticipating customer needs.

“Capgemini is entering the next phase of its strategic partnership with Google Cloud and this new collaboration focuses on driving revenue for our clients by elevating customer service to a strategic value driver in industries where CX is paramount,” said Fernando Alvarez, Chief Strategy and Development Officer and Group Executive Board Member at Capgemini. “The customer service function is undergoing a transformative shift as business leaders increasingly recognize its importance in unlocking commercial potential. Agentic systems can play a key role in this, and the future of customer service will require a strategic blend of human and virtual agents, enhanced by generative and agentic AI. By understanding the potential of agentic AI and the business realities of our clients, we’re expertly placed to maximize its value and deliver genuine impact.”

""Businesses require a combination of technical expertise and advanced technology to fully realize the benefits of agentic AI within their current IT infrastructure. Through Agentspace and our new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol, our partnership with Capgemini will provide clients with AI solutions that drive long-term value across industries,” said Kevin Ichhpurani, President, Global Partner Organization, Google Cloud.

Primarily focused on telco, retail, and financial services, the partnership is intended to expand into further industries such as life sciences and utilities, with a goal of accelerating business outcomes by enabling customer services transformation. This includes areas such as:

Improving productivity in telco: New solutions to optimize call routing and resolution in contact centers by leveraging conversational AI to improve intent and understanding, increase call containment and assist agents. Organizations can benefit from reduced handling time and improved first-call resolution rates, while human agents are freed-up to focus on higher value tasks. Capgemini’s research finds that around 9 in 10 organizations using gen AI are already seeing improved first contact resolution rates or expecting to see this benefit in the future.1

Personalizing CX in retail: AI agents to help better personalize shopping experiences by using AI to analyze customer data and provide tailored product recommendations, promotions, and support interactions across all channels (online, in-store, mobile).

Enhancing security in financial services Using Google Cloud’s AI, financial services clients can improve risk assessment and fraud detection with agents that analyze customer transactions and identify suspicious patterns, improving security and regulatory compliance.

Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol will enable AI agents to successfully communicate with one another, safely exchange information, and coordinate actions no matter which platform they are running on or built on top of. As agentic AI becomes more widely adopted, this protocol will ensure agent functionality across diverse and separate data sources and applications.

Google Cloud recognizes Capgemini as a trusted partner for driving clients’ large-scale transformation, with the company winning three Google Cloud Partner of the Year awards in 2025. The awards celebrate Capgemini’s expertise in creating compelling solutions that make an impact for joint clients worldwide:

Global Industry Solutions Partner of the Year

Global Industry Solutions Partner of the Year for Sustainability

Country Partner of the Year in Denmark

According to BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, customer pushback in international markets has the potential to be detrimental to American brands.
McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4% last quarter, a surprise considering the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected, but its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, due to an E. coli outbreak in late October.
The brand's international stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, and there was more growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China.
For the company’s Q1 results, total same-store sales were down 4% year over year and international same-store sales fell 4%, while China sales dropped 6%.","Trump's worldwide reciprocal tariffs continue to cause huge upset among targeted countries, while brands in the US are worrying about the potential problems that lie ahead.

One concern among analysts is the anti-American sentiment towards US brands likely to emerge, which could in turn result in a major price increase for customers at places like McDonald's.

The effect of tariffs on commodity imports is generally small for food chains, as many of the ingredients used are domestically grown and most imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from tariffs, under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

But there are other worries plaguing brands like McDonald's, Yum! Brands, Starbucks, and Domino's. According to BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, customer pushback in international markets has the potential to be detrimental to American brands.

Saleh told Yahoo Finance, ""The bigger issue, in my mind, is the anti-American pushback in these countries on Western or US brands ... we'll see ... what companies say when they start reporting in the next couple of weeks if they're starting to see that already.”

Foreign boycotts overall will cut US GDP by 0.1% to 0.3% this year, meaning a hit of roughly $28 billion to $83 billion, according to Goldman Sachs.

Analysts are also concerned about the tariff's impact on consumer spending.

UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday, “We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand.”

This comes at a time when fast food businesses are only just getting back on their feet after reeling from the covid pandemic.

McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4% last quarter, a surprise considering the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected, but its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, due to an E. coli outbreak in late October.

The brand's international stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, and there was more growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China.

Last month it was announced that McDonalds was no longer the largest restaurant chain in the world, as it was taken over by Chinese bubble tea and ice cream chain Mixue Bingcheng.

The bubble tea chain currently has more than 45,000 restaurants worldwide as of September 2024, while the number of McDonald’s restaurants all over the world remains at around 41,800, according to Statista via Chowhound.

Meanwhile coffee giant Starbucks is still fighting to see a rebound in its international business. For the company’s Q1 results, total same-store sales were down 4% year over year and international same-store sales fell 4%, while China sales dropped 6%.

According to Anchorage Daily News, Carrs-Safeway is closing its store and pharmacy located in a small town in Alaska.

The store, which is a subsidiary of Albertsons, has been open since 1957.

'It's devastating,' president of the Fairview Community Council James Thornton told Anchorage Daily News.

'The neighborhood needs this primary source of food, especially those that don't have vehicles.

'It's their only way to get food and medicine in a lot of cases.'

Community leaders have warned that locals in the town will not be able to buy essentials, with many residents lacking cars to drive further afield.

Former store manager Richard Watts Jr. called it “a very sad day”.

Watts began his decades long career at Carrs working at the Gambell store in 1964 as a box boy, and worked his way up to becoming a manager.

He said the store was unique as it was so central to the people in the neighborhood.

“The Carrs-Safeway on Gambell is the heartbeat of Fairview, so it’s almost like cutting the heart out of the community,” Watts said.

“I just hope another store opens there after it closes.”

The grocery chain said pharmacists and prescriptions will be transferred to the Carrs pharmacy nearby while 35 employees will be given the option to move to other stores in the city.

'Carrs-Safeway has been proudly serving Anchorage for decades, and the decision to close this store isn't one we made lightly,' the chain said in a statement.

'With our focus on growth, we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores, and occasionally it's necessary to close locations that are not growing and are perpetually unable to meet financial expectations.'

RETAIL APOCALYPSE

A number of major retailers are suffering as the sector grapples with changing consumer behavior, the rise of e-commerce, and inflationary pressures sparked by the pandemic.

With a raft of chains, including Walmart, winding back their retail footprint, experts say companies are suffering from increased borrowing costs and consumers tightening their wallets amid ongoing cost of living pressures.

According to analysis by retail data provider CoreSight, there has been a 24% increase in store closures in 2024 alone.

Amid growing concern over pharmacy deserts, CVS last year announced it had replaced CEO Karen Lynch with company veteran David Joyner and withdrew its 2024 profit forecast amid growing investor pressure.

In 2024, the pharmacy giant revealed plans to lay off nearly 3,000 employees, as the company struggles to drive higher profits and improved stock performance.

Department stores, including Macy’s, are closing about 150 underperforming stores, blaming competition from big box retailers and a shift to online shopping.

Discount retailer Big Lots has also announced the closure of more than 340 of its 1400 shops across the country after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2024.

Shopping mall space has also been shrinking or being re-purposed, first from 2009 to 2016, and then again during the pandemic.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/ES_CARRS_OFFPLAT.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-04-09 13:17:07.683164

Kroger directed the bulk of the borrowed funds to the share-buyback program it implemented after the merger fell apart.
Albertsons is also seeking to collect a $600 million termination fee from Kroger.","Kroger poured more than $1 billion over three years into its unsuccessful quest to combine with rival Albertsons, the supermarket chain disclosed in a regulatory filing last week.

The expenses primarily consisted of third-party professional fees and credit facility fees Kroger incurred as it sought to obtain regulatory approval for the proposed merger, which drew fierce opposition from the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general on the grounds that it would be anticompetitive.

In its annual 10-K report for 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger said it recorded $684 million in merger-related costs last year. That amount was on top of $316 million the company spent on fees and other expenses related to the merger in 2023, as well as $44 million it devoted to the deal in 2022.

Kroger also said it took on $34 million in interest expenses in 2024 related to $10.5 billion the company borrowed in preparation for its acquisition of Albertsons. Kroger directed the bulk of the borrowed funds to the share-buyback program it implemented after the merger fell apart.

Kroger and Albertsons announced their intention to combine in a deal valued at $24.6 billion in October 2022, sparking swift and loud blowback from a range of foes that included labor groups and politicians as well as government antitrust officials. The FTC sought a federal court order to stop the merger, while the attorneys general of Washington state and Colorado asked state courts to block the deal. On Dec. 10, a federal judge granted the FTC’s request to halt the deal and a judge in Washington also ruled against the merger.

Kroger now faces the cost of defending itself against a lawsuit Albertsons filed accusing it of sabotaging the merger by not taking more aggressive steps to assuage the FTC’s concern that the deal would have created an overly powerful supermarket company.

CLN, a longstanding manufacturer of metal components for the automotive sector, has been facing financial challenges, leading to its filing for court protection in October 2024. The company had previously proposed a 90% reduction of its unsecured debt, which was met with resistance from creditors. A revised proposal with a smaller reduction is currently under consideration. ​

In addition to the potential sale of its Italian plants, CLN is also in talks with Stellantis regarding the sale of facilities in Brazil and Poland. However, Stellantis has yet to make a formal commitment, and the future scope of CLN’s operations remains uncertain. ​

Founded post-World War II by Mario Magnetto, CLN is predominantly owned by the Magnetto family (75%), with the remaining stake held by steel producer ArcelorMittal. The company is headquartered near Turin, Italy, the historic base of Fiat—now a brand under Stellantis—and has expanded its operations across Europe, Latin America, China, and South Africa.

This development aligns with Stellantis Chairman John Elkann’s efforts to bolster Italian car production. Following the departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares, Elkann reaffirmed a commitment to procure €6 billion (approximately $6.5 billion) in orders from Italian suppliers during a parliamentary hearing in Rome earlier this month. ​

While official comments from Stellantis and CLN are pending, the potential acquisition of CLN’s Italian assets could represent a strategic move to stabilize the supply chain, preserve employment, and enhance production capabilities in the region amid ongoing challenges in the global automotive industry.​",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STELLANTISLogo-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-04-09 12:20:14.512776

Building on its existing partnership, Capgemini will create industry-specific agentic AI solutions designed to handle customer requests across all communication channels (web, social, phone etc.) and improve employee productivity. Underpinned by Google Cloud’s AI technology, Capgemini will develop bespoke solutions designed to enhance customer services with intelligent automation and deep customer insights, enabling organizations to deliver more personalized, efficient, and effective CX to elevate brand perception, increase loyalty, and drive revenue growth.

A recent report by the Capgemini Research Institute found that although customer service is considered strategically important, less than half of organizations feel prepared to integrate AI and generative AI into the function.[1] Recognized as the Global Industry Solution Partner of the Year 2025 by Google Cloud, Capgemini will combine its deep industry expertise and technical capabilities to develop solutions powered by Google Agentspace and Customer Engagement Suite with Google AI. This will accelerate adoption of secure, trusted agentic AI capabilities that are interoperable with a client’s existing technology infrastructure and can support a variety of industry and regulatory needs. The agentic AI solutions will be designed to significantly optimize business processes and unlock commercial value by enhancing organizations’ own search capabilities, automating complex workflows, as well as understanding and proactively anticipating customer needs.

“Capgemini is entering the next phase of its strategic partnership with Google Cloud and this new collaboration focuses on driving revenue for our clients by elevating customer service to a strategic value driver in industries where CX is paramount,” said Fernando Alvarez, Chief Strategy and Development Officer and Group Executive Board Member at Capgemini. “The customer service function is undergoing a transformative shift as business leaders increasingly recognize its importance in unlocking commercial potential. Agentic systems can play a key role in this, and the future of customer service will require a strategic blend of human and virtual agents, enhanced by generative and agentic AI. By understanding the potential of agentic AI and the business realities of our clients, we’re expertly placed to maximize its value and deliver genuine impact.”

“Businesses require a combination of technical expertise and advanced technology to fully realize the benefits of agentic AI within their current IT infrastructure. Through Agentspace and our new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol, our partnership with Capgemini will provide clients with AI solutions that drive long-term value across industries,” said Kevin Ichhpurani, President, Global Partner Organization, Google Cloud.

Primarily focused on telco, retail, and financial services, the partnership is intended to expand into further industries such as life sciences and utilities, with a goal of accelerating business outcomes by enabling customer services transformation. This includes areas such as:

Improving productivity in telco: New solutions to optimize call routing and resolution in contact centers by leveraging conversational AI to improve intent and understanding, increase call containment and assist agents. Organizations can benefit from reduced handling time and improved first-call resolution rates, while human agents are freed-up to focus on higher value tasks. Capgemini’s research finds that around 9 in 10 organizations using gen AI are already seeing improved first contact resolution rates or expecting to see this benefit in the future.1

Personalizing CX in retail: AI agents to help better personalize shopping experiences by using AI to analyze customer data and provide tailored product recommendations, promotions, and support interactions across all channels (online, in-store, mobile).

Enhancing security in financial services Using Google Cloud’s AI, financial services clients can improve risk assessment and fraud detection with agents that analyze customer transactions and identify suspicious patterns, improving security and regulatory compliance.

Google Cloud’s new Agent2Agent interoperability protocol will enable AI agents to successfully communicate with one another, safely exchange information, and coordinate actions no matter which platform they are running on or built on top of. As agentic AI becomes more widely adopted, this protocol will ensure agent functionality across diverse and separate data sources and applications.

Google Cloud recognizes Capgemini as a trusted partner for driving clients’ large-scale transformation, with the company winningthree Google Cloud Partner of the Year awards in 2025. The awards celebrate Capgemini’s expertise in creating compelling solutions that make an impact for joint clients worldwide:

""We're obviously very excited about the acquisition,” Duetto CEO David Woolenberg told Hotel Management in an exclusive interview last week.
“The acquisition accelerates Duetto’s ambition to become the definitive revenue- and profit-operating system for the hotel industry.” The entire HotStats team—including CEO Michael Grove—will join Duetto.
The leadership team will continue to lead the business in partnership and collaboration with the broader Duetto team.
“Duetto customers can purchase HotStats’ financial-benchmarking solution to better understand relative performance and to improve efficiency and profitability across individual properties and portfolios.","The mergers and acquisitions across the hospitality industry are continuing apace: Revenue-management software company Duetto has acquired HotStats, a hotel benchmarking, financial-performance reporting, market data and insights company. Going forward, HotStats will operate as a subsidiary of Duetto and will be known as HotStats, a Duetto company. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

""We're obviously very excited about the acquisition,” Duetto CEO David Woolenberg told Hotel Management in an exclusive interview last week. “The acquisition accelerates Duetto’s ambition to become the definitive revenue- and profit-operating system for the hotel industry.”

The entire HotStats team—including CEO Michael Grove—will join Duetto. The leadership team will continue to lead the business in partnership and collaboration with the broader Duetto team. “We’re really building on an incredible foundation here,” Woolenberg said. “Duetto brings expertise in tech development, cloud-based software and operational optimization that will help drive better outcomes for HotStats and its customers.”

Building a Deal

HotStats’ financial benchmarking capabilities and global reach “align well” with Duetto’s focus on driving profit optimization across every revenue stream, Woolenberg said. “We can provide hoteliers worldwide with a differentiated view of both their top-line revenue and operating performance across rooms, food-and-beverage and ancillary services.” HotStats is a “trusted global brand” with longstanding customer relationships, he added—“Their team has put a lot of work into creating standardized reporting, data aggregation [and] reporting systems, which is incredibly valuable.”

The acquisition aligns with Duetto’s focus on top-line performance, adds the profit perspective and drives expansion into the data ecosystem, Woolenberg continued. “We love the culture of HotStats,” he said. “We love the brand they've built. They've got great relationships with their customers, and that aligns very well with what we've built at Duetto. We are excited to continue to innovate and develop new solutions for the hospitality industry.”

Benefitting the Industry

The two CEOs expect HotStats’ core offering in hotel-profitability benchmarking to support Duetto’s goal to give better visibility into top and bottom line, according to a statement from the two companies. The complementary products can provide a clear view of revenue and profit performance.

The leaders see other advantages of the partnership as well. “From a structural point of view, obviously the expertise that Duetto has in the areas of technical development, for instance, [is] where we should be able to leverage some of the expertise over time,” Grove told Hotel Management last week.

Overlaps and Opportunities

While there is some crossover between Duetto’s and HotStats’ audiences and customers, there is plenty of opportunity for both companies to continue to grow, according to Grove. “Partnering with Duetto allows us to uncover entirely new sales opportunities,” he noted. “The scale and efficiencies across the business will allow us to optimize our operating structure. There will also be the ability for us to leverage their expertise and allow us to scale from a business-development point of view.”

The solutions will be sold separately, but Woolenberg is excited to introduce HotStats products to Duetto’s existing customers. “Duetto customers can purchase HotStats’ financial-benchmarking solution to better understand relative performance and to improve efficiency and profitability across individual properties and portfolios. HotStats will sell their products to Duetto customers, and we hope to sell Duetto to HotStats customers—but they will remain distinct products.”

Woolenberg expects the two businesses to continue growing together as they have been doing individually. “We aspire to become the revenue- and profit-operating system for the hotel industry, and we think there's a huge value proposition underlying that,” he continued. “As we fulfill that vision, we expect to bring on more customers for both companies and unlock new growth channels. We are excited to explore what we can innovate and build for the industry in the coming years.”

I don't mean that in a bad way, but, indeed, no matter where you venture — be it within Toronto or, really, anywhere else in the world — you're sure to find a Starbucks location not too far away.
Losing Starbucks locations is nothing new for the neighbourhood, who have seen locations at Queen and Hammersmith (now a Pizzaiolo location) and Queen and Waverley (now What A Bagel) shut down in years past, nor is it for Toronto, who saw dozens of Starbucks locations close down in a restructuring back in 2021.
A representative from Starbucks tells me that, rather than some Queen-related bias, the closure of my beloved Queen East location actually comes as the result of a natural lease expiration.

Oh, Starbucks. We've come a long way since the early days of the Seattle-based coffee house.

What was once viewed as an indie enclave for pretentious bohemians has evolved into the McDonald's of coffee shops. I don't mean that in a bad way, but, indeed, no matter where you venture — be it within Toronto or, really, anywhere else in the world — you're sure to find a Starbucks location not too far away.

For my part, living within spitting distance of a handful of exemplary indie coffee houses with the nearest Starbucks location a longer walk away, my own patronage to the coffee chain has waned in recent years, but I once could have been the poster child for the chain.

More specifically, growing up in the Beaches, the location at Queen East and Brookmount was a second home to me, supplementing early mornings in high school and hunger that could only be sated with a pink cake pop before after-school activities.

Though I've since moved out of the neighbourhood and don't visit that location much anymore, I couldn't help but be heartbroken to learn that that very location — 1842 Queen Street East — is slated to shut down for good this spring.

Losing Starbucks locations is nothing new for the neighbourhood, who have seen locations at Queen and Hammersmith (now a Pizzaiolo location) and Queen and Waverley (now What A Bagel) shut down in years past, nor is it for Toronto, who saw dozens of Starbucks locations close down in a restructuring back in 2021.

More recently, locations on Queens Quay and Queen West have closed down, too. Maybe they just don't like Queen?

A representative from Starbucks tells me that, rather than some Queen-related bias, the closure of my beloved Queen East location actually comes as the result of a natural lease expiration.

""When we approach the end of a lease with any of our stores, we review the partner and customer experience, and after careful consideration, we decided to not renew our lease at this location,"" they explain.

The last day of operation for the location will be May 18, they add.

In his new role, Davidson will oversee all production activities across the agency’s portfolio.","Austin-based independent agency Callen has appointed Jess Monsey as its first-ever chief opportunity officer and named Mike Davidson head of production.

The leadership expansion comes after the creative shop, which doubled in size between 2023 and 2024, reported a 12% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025.

Since the start of the year, it has also added five new clients to its books, including Vera Bradley, Nutpods, and Long Drink.

Monsey, a former Wieden+Kennedy president and managing director, and 72andSunny managing director, returns to the advertising industry after a two-year hiatus spent developing The Paladins League, a library of over 500 tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons.

She brings a wealth of experience from her previous roles where her work for brands such as Old Spice earned her Cannes Grand Prix awards and a Grand Effie.

In her newly created role at Callen, she will identify growth opportunities for the agency’s roster of clients, including Disney+, Supercell, and Olipop. She will also lead proactive business outreach initiatives.

Davidson, meanwhile, brings over 20 years of production expertise to Callen, most recently serving as executive vp and managing director of brand production at PXP, Publicis Groupe’s global content and production network.

Throughout his career, he’s led creative campaigns for brands like Nike, Coca-Cola, and Old Spice, earning Cannes Lions and The One Show accolades. Davidson’s experience also includes senior roles at Media.Monks and Wieden+Kennedy, where he worked closely with Callen’s Craig Allen and David Hughes.

In his new role, Davidson will oversee all production activities across the agency’s portfolio.

A bumper year ahead

The new hires will help sustain momentum and drive further expansion for the agency, which now employs 25.

Founder and chief creative officer Craig Allen attributes much of Callen’s success to the agency’s collaborative culture. “Our full-time employees often start in a freelance role to ensure that we’re a good fit for each other both socially and professionally, like a test drive without all the awkward negotiating at the end,” he told ADWEEK.

“We like to keep a healthy balance between work and fun and create an environment that people want to be a part of, so we’ve been lucky that the people we really want here also very much want to be a part of what we’re building.”

Monsey told ADWEEK the role drew her back to advertising because of the opportunity to collaborate with a bold, creative team.

“I get lit up working with creative people who lead with imagination and a deep desire to take extraordinary creative leaps that people never saw coming,” Monsey said. “Craig is the epitome of that, and together with Mike, the three of us have a track record of work that I’m insanely proud of.”

David Hughes, president at Callen, shared his thoughts on the new chief opportunity officer remit: “Since I have known Jess, no one has unlocked more opportunities where others might not have seen it,” Hughes said. “Leading all things ‘opportunity’ for Callen—with existing or new partners—only made sense as her officially-official title.”

Hughes said Davidson’s ability to push boundaries in production, and “execute at the highest level of craft, and foster innovative thinking,” made him the perfect fit for the team.

Davidson views production as a “vital component” to the agency’s wider strategy: “Woven into our process throughout, we work more efficiently in moving from ideas to making, more strategic utilization of our client budgets and driving growth through successful delivery and performance of our creative output,” he said.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/callen-staff-2025.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:15.180039

Razer.com has mysteriously delisted all laptop products in the US, including the upcoming Razer Blade 16. Instead, the site is only offering various accessories. Its Canada site continues to take laptop orders and preorders.

For now, Razer is remaining mum on the change, telling The Verge, “We do not have a comment at this stage regarding tariffs.” But we wouldn’t be surprised if the company is taking a page from Nintendo and reviewing potential price changes to offset cost increases from Trump’s tariffs, which take effect on Wednesday.

No laptops, but you can buy a skin for your Razer notebook. (Credit: Razer.com)

Framework Computer, another PC vendor, has also temporarily discontinued several base models of the company’s 13-inch laptop, citing Trump’s tariffs on Taiwan. “We priced our laptops when tariffs on imports from Taiwan were 0%. At a 10% tariff, we would have to sell the lowest-end SKUs at a loss,” the company said.

In a tweet, Framework also claims that rival PC makers have been quietly delisting lower-priced products in response to the tariffs. Indeed, MSI’s online store seems to have stopped accepting new laptop orders as well; the site is only showing a “notify me” option.

Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are expected to affect a wide range of consumer electronics since most are made in the tariffed countries, including China, Vietnam, India, Malaysia, and Cambodia. Entry-level products, which have thin margins between their manufacturing cost and final price, will see the most impact, forcing vendors to raise prices, analysts have told PCMag.

“As far as I can tell, almost all consumer electronics categories would be better off being bought sooner rather than later, especially given the latest threat of an additional 50% tariff on China,” said Ishan Dutt, an analyst with Canalys.

On Wednesday, Trump plans on raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%, which threatens to drastically raise prices for many products.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/04PCJaNrpR9atOdujeHTEIX-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1744145288.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 14:10:51.635233

'What it really means to be a barista' Zavatsky, from Nanticoke, started working as a barista seven months ago.
There are 18 employees at the Wilkes-Barre location, Zavatsky said.
But hopefully after ours goes through, they [will] get motivated and cheer on Starbucks Workers United,” Zavatsky said.
“The backing of the Starbucks Workers United … makes it a lot easier,"" Zavatsky said.","Employees at Starbucks' location on Kidder Street in Wilkes-Barre are looking to unionize. They also say they have been under heightened scrutiny from corporate management since they filed election paperwork on March 24.

“We've had the district manager coming in a lot more lately, kind of observing us. We've noticed a few people actually sitting in the lobby taking notes … and just staring at us for almost the entire day. They've started cracking down on the dress code, on time, attendance and a lot of other things so far,” barista Bree Zavatsky said.

Staff at the Kidder Street location, which opened last year, are looking to join Starbucks Workers United (SBWU), a national unionization effort of over 10,500 baristas at over 550 stores. A vote is expected in the coming weeks.

Starbucks spokesperson Phil Gee denied the $89.18 billion company was engaging in any union-busting efforts.

“At Starbucks, our success starts and ends with our partners (employees). We respect our partners' right to choose, through a fair and democratic process, to be represented by a union or not to be represented by a union, and will continue to work together to make Starbucks the best job in retail,” Gee wrote in an email.

'What it really means to be a barista'

Zavatsky, from Nanticoke, started working as a barista seven months ago. She said she liked the work at first more than her previous jobs.

“But I'm kind of slowly realizing how much corporate really doesn't have the workers' best interests in mind,” Zavatsky said during a phone interview.

Zavatsky claims Starbucks is “cracking down” on workers by scheduling shifts with fewer breaks and by demanding they cut drive-through wait times to 45 seconds without hiring extra staff.

There are 18 employees at the Wilkes-Barre location, Zavatsky said.

“I think everyone around here is honestly scared of Starbucks' union-busting. So, they're kind of just waiting it out until we have our election and see how it goes. But hopefully after ours goes through, they [will] get motivated and cheer on Starbucks Workers United,” Zavatsky said.

Lyssie Parente, a shift supervisor of six months, accused Starbucks of “empty promises,"" and said the work environment is taking a toll.

“We get increased workloads with decreased hours and a paycheck that laughs in our faces, all while feeding us the ‘we're a family’ and ‘we care about mental health,'"" Parente said.

""We're angry, we're frustrated, we can't sleep at night, we're anxious, we're depressed,"" Parente said, adding: ""but we are still here because we are the change we want to see in this company, and we demand the respect and fair treatment we deserve.""

Ashton Balliet, a shift supervisor at the Kidder Street location, said her store is “not anti-Starbucks. We believe a union is the best way to get back to what it really means to be a barista.”

“Year after year, Starbucks claims to be going back to its roots, but the only seeds being planted are those in the CEO’s pockets,"" Balliet said in a statement emailed from the union.

Negotiations update

Workers United formed nearly four years ago in Buffalo, New York to push for higher wages. Starbucks recognized the union last year, but negotiations have stalled since January 2025 over a collective bargaining agreement.

Starbucks gave a brief update on negotiations.

“Starbucks and Workers United have agreed to engage a mediator to assist the two parties in reaching a framework for single store contracts for our partners represented by the union. We have made progress over the last nine months of bargaining, and we are committed to continuing to work together — with a mediator’s assistance — to navigate complex issues and reach fair contracts,” Gee said.

Workers United spokesperson Claire Connolly said the mediation process is confidential and she could not share specifics about negotiations.

""Starbucks Workers United understands the concerns of their member baristas and are committed to fighting for a fair contract that addresses wages, staffing issues and strong benefits,” Connolly wrote in an email.

Zavatsky hopes neighboring Starbucks locations will start to unionize by late April, after her location holds its election through the National Labor Relations Board.

“After that, we get to join the cause for Starbucks Workers United and get their protections … Unfortunately for now, it is a waiting game for the next three weeks,” Zavatsky said.

She believes the union ""definitely has our backs on this"" in the meanwhile, adding that the union has filed 90 complaints against Starbucks in January alone.

Together, Subway and Leo aim to refine what the release called a “transformative, guest-centric marketing strategy.” Subway is known for ads featuring elite athletes like Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes and Simone Biles and an “Eat Fresh” tagline.

Lyons departed PepsiCo late last month after a long stint as CMO of the company’s sprawling U.S. beverages unit, which houses brands including Mountain Dew, Starry and Gatorade.

Many U.S. companies have refocused supply chains to Vietnam, Thailand and other countries in the region, partly because labor costs have risen in China over the decades. They’ve also tapped into the once-hot trend of “friend-shoring,” where firms look to shift supply chains away from China and toward U.S. allies.

However, Trump plans to impose steep tariffs on the region—46% on Vietnam, 36% on Thailand, 49% on Cambodia, and 24% on Malaysia, for example. The countries have built large trade surpluses with the United States, as factories that make Nike apparel or Apple products have moved in.

“This effectively closes off options for rerouting international trade flows, which means these countries will not only feel the full force of tariffs but there will be broader disruption to global supply chains,” Jeremy Leonard, managing director of global industry services at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients.

Southeast Asian Countries Are Looking to Make a Deal—As Apparel Makers Hold Their Breath

Changes may be coming as Wednesday's tariff deadline approaches. Cambodia has offered to cut tariffs on U.S. goods, Indonesia is offering to negotiate and Thailand is seeking to boost U.S. imports.

Trump has said Vietnam has offered to cut its tariffs to zero. However, his trade advisor Peter Navarro later told CNBC that it “means nothing to us because it’s the nontariff cheating that matters,” citing concerns about intellectual property theft or Chinese products making their way to the U.S. through Vietnam. Bloomberg reported that a top Vietnamese official has headed to Washington, D.C., for negotiations.

The outcome of the negotiations could have a significant impact on American companies. Nike’s stock fell sharply after Trump’s tariff announcements and has failed to regain momentum. The company sources 50% of its shoes and 28% of its apparel from Vietnam, according to its most recent annual report.

Nearly 20% of U.S. apparel imports and 34% of footwear imports come from Vietnam, and Cambodia, Bangladesh and Indonesia are also major exporters, Straton wrote.

But It's Not Just Southeast Asia That Will Be Affected

Though markets had expected punishing tariffs on China, the tough policies against Southeast Asia were a surprise, Morgan Stanley consumer retail analyst Alex Straton wrote in a note to clients last week.

“Past efforts to diversify away from China will no longer afford much protection,” Straton wrote.

“Put on your life vest, as the waters are getting choppier,” BMO Capital Markets analysts warned in a note to investors early Wednesday morning.

“So do you do the same thing with bringing people over from Ireland [for pharma manufacturing]?” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday offered a solution: hire laid off federal workers to staff manufacturing jobs.
The BMO group said that often manufacturing facilities are situated near the source of ingredients to ease the production process.","President Donald Trump is going to levy the pharmaceutical industry with tariffs despite broad objections to the plan. While he has not yet revealed the specifics, the industry is girding for potentially disruptive fees that will, according to many experts, do nothing to encourage onshoring of pharmaceutical manufacturing or make drugs cheaper.

“Put on your life vest, as the waters are getting choppier,” BMO Capital Markets analysts warned in a note to investors early Wednesday morning.

As the industry awaits official word from the administration, pharma stocks are tanking, and analysts and other experts are considering the possible scenarios.

Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, pointed out that pharmas cannot just suddenly switch manufacturing to the U.S., even though most of the major companies have facilities in the country.

“It’s just a matter of how much capacity and how quickly can you switch that capacity to the U.S. so you could sidestep the tariff,” Wong told BioSpace.

There are a lot of unknowns at this point, but Wong said the tariffs will come down to what tax rate companies are charged as they move operations back to the U.S. “That’s the whole reason why they’re manufacturing [in] Ireland,” for example, he said.

BMO analysts agreed that pharmas do “capitalize on housing [intellectual property] in foreign jurisdictions.” But some companies like Eli Lilly and Vertex Pharmaceuticals have huge operations in the U.S. Lilly also just announced a $27 billion investment in manufacturing stateside. So did Johnson & Johnson, with a $55 billion commitment.

“It’s hard to believe that any administration would want to harm US companies, let alone US BioPharma, which is, in our view, an extremely enviable sector,” BMO wrote. “The US consistently has first access to the best medicines globally, reliable supply of any medicine. Having some supply chain overseas is good, as this adds redundancy/reliability.”

The industry had been working toward shifting some manufacturing outside of China due to pressures from Congress last year to do so. The BIOSECURE Act was to mandate a phase out of operations with certain contract manufacturing organizations like WuXi Biologics. While the legislation never passed—and as of now, has not been taken up again—the threat spooked biopharma into taking action.

But even if a pharma does have a facility capable of producing drugs in the U.S., finding the necessary staff to operate it will prove challenging, Wong said.

“Where are you going to hire these people from?” he wondered aloud. “The labor market is pretty tight within healthcare and to get people trained up and have that expertise brought up, that’s going to be difficult, and it’s going to take time to get the full efficiency.”

Wong pointed to the semiconductor industry, which has been similarly challenged to bring manufacturing to the U.S. “They have to bring people over from Taiwan into the States,” he said. “So do you do the same thing with bringing people over from Ireland [for pharma manufacturing]?”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday offered a solution: hire laid off federal workers to staff manufacturing jobs. But Wong says these jobs are highly skilled and take time to train for.

“I’m not saying you can’t find it, but it’s going to take time to hire up and it’s going to take time to train,” Wong said. “It’s going to take time to get to that higher level efficiency. I gotta think you have to bring people over from overseas.”

BMO agreed. “Global supply chains are complex, with Pharma among the most,” the analysts wrote—""it’s not as simple as moving where someone screws in little screws to make an iPhone.”

Running Out the Clock

Another key question is whether the tariffs will be based on the cost of goods, including raw materials, labor and direct factory overheads. Other uncertainties include the tariff rate, whether the fees will be phased in or dumped whole hog, and what products they will apply to.

Tariffs could hit big, branded biologics and high-margin products or lower cost generics, Wong said. Both options would be a big blow to the industry. Generics make up about 90% of prescriptions written in the U.S., while biologics and brand-name drugs make the most revenue.

For the high-margin branded products, Wong said, “there’s going to be some cost-cutting, and it’s going to take time to reabsorb that hit on the tariff.” Pharmas have more leeway to pass the costs on to customers, he added. On the generics side, pharmas have little wiggle room to raise prices and absorb the tariff cost because of the “commodity-like nature” of the market, according to a recent S&P Global Ratings analysis.

Ultimately, a lot of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) still come from overseas, China in particular. Trump has particularly targeted China with the highest tariff rates and pharmaceuticals have not been excluded from that. If a 10% tariff is enacted on API from China, S&P estimated that a generics company would take a 2% to 3% hit on its profit margins. If companies do seek alternative sources for these drug ingredients, S&P worried about supply disruptions and an exacerbation of drug shortages.

Wong noted that companies sign long-term contracts for these ingredients; they can’t just sever agreements on a whim. The BMO group said that often manufacturing facilities are situated near the source of ingredients to ease the production process.

With all these factors to consider and the time to implement any shifts in production, BMO speculates that pharma is simply going to wait out the changes brought by the new administration. “We expect most large pharma’s are likely to look at imposed tariffs with the intention of ‘running out the clock,’ waiting until the end of Trump’s presidency to consider more permanent manufacturing decisions.”

While innovative, unapproved products likely won’t be directly targeted, S&P noted that the tariffs could put a chilling effect on the pharma and life-science industries, impacting clinical trials and patient data. This could lead to delays in new drug development.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/ab31863/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1354x762+0+6/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F58%2F16%2F1b11ffa9498fb76d228d361c661d%2Fistock-1343489133.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 13:19:01.073946

Sofia Quaglia reports for The Guardian.

In short:

Researchers identified 56 major companies responsible for half of all plastic waste, with six companies –Altria, Philip Morris International, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Danone and PepsiCo– producing a quarter of that.

Over five years, the team collected 1,870,000 items of plastic waste across 84 countries.

Companies are making efforts to increase recyclability and reduce virgin plastic use.

Despite corporate initiatives, plastic production and pollution have risen in lockstep, challenging the effectiveness of current recycling efforts.

CVS Health named a new CFO Tuesday as the healthcare giant continues to shake up its leadership team.

Brian Newman, most recently CFO of shipping and logistics firm UPS, will start at CVS on April 21. Tom Cowhey, who took on the permanent CFO position at CVS early last year, will become a strategic adviser to CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

In addition to the leadership change, CVS said it expects financial results for 2025 to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance. In February, the company reported expected adjusted earnings for the year between $5.75 and $6 a share.

Dive Insight:

Newman will receive a base salary of $1 million, and his target annual equity award compensation will be $7 million, CVS said in a securities filing.

Cowhey will step down from the finance chief position about a year and half after he first took on the interim role.

He started at CVS in 2022, and then took on the interim CFO job in October 2023 after previous finance chief Shawn Guertin left due to family health reasons.

Cowhey will serve as strategic adviser and assist with transitioning his work until he leaves the company on a date that hasn’t yet been determined, according to a securities filing.

CVS also named Amy Compton-Phillips, previously chief physician executive of survey and patient experience firm Press Ganey, as chief medical officer, beginning May 19. She replaces Sree Chaguturu, who was named president of CVS’ healthcare delivery business in November, the company said in the filing.

The latest appointments come as CVS has made a number of recent leadership changes in recent months while it navigates a challenging financial environment. The company cut 1% of its workforce during layoffs last year, among other hardships.

The company’s profits were nearly cut in half last year as CVS’ insurance unit, Aetna, weathered heightened medical costs, particularly in government healthcare programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.

Joyner took up the chief executive post in October, replacing Karen Lynch as the firm pulled earnings guidance due to elevated expenses at Aetna. Weeks later, the company named Steve Nelson, previously the CEO of value-based primary care company ChenMed, as president of the insurer.

CVS also tapped Ed DeVaney to serve as permanent president of CVS Caremark, the healthcare giant’s pharmacy benefit manager, in February.

Those are the health care industry's powerful middlemen between drug manufacturers and pharmacies, often owned by the same entities that operate drugstores or insurance companies.

Before Tuesday's amendment, a CVS Health executive told IndyStar that Senate Bill 140 was ""one of the most extreme pieces of legislation we've seen."" A Delaware-based pro-PBM lobbying group, Conservatives for Lower Care Costs, took out local ads on airways and social media urging lawmakers to vote the bill down.

A House committee on Tuesday decided to rein in the biggest swing in the bill which would have prevented PBMs and health insurers that operate in Indiana from having an ownership stake in one another, known as vertical integration. This is the case among each of the country's largest PBMs: For example, CVS Health Corporation owns CVS Caremark, the PBM with the largest market share in the country, as well as CVS Pharmacy and insurer Aetna.

But make no mistake, says the committee chair, Republican Rep. Martin Carbaugh: Senate Bill 140 will still make some significant moves to challenge the consolidated industry.

""I think it's much bigger than maybe people realize,"" he told IndyStar.

'Throw the marketplace into chaos'

Opponents of vertical integration argue it gives PBMs more power to manipulate the market in favor of profits at the expense of patients, since there's less competition ― an allegation over which the Federal Trade Commission has sued the three largest PBMs. Those three largest PBMs conduct 80% of the country's prescription drug business.

PBMs say the blame for high drug costs lie with the manufacturers, and PBMs use their market power to negotiate rebates. Because of how widespread and common vertical integration is, making it illegal in Indiana would wreak such administrative havoc as to make doing business in Indiana impractical for many PBMs, Prem Shah, executive vice president and group president of CVS Health, told IndyStar.

""It's going to throw the marketplace into chaos, honestly,"" he said.

The bill's author, Republican Sen. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso, himself called it an ""aggressive"" idea in a committee meeting. The bill is the result of six years of studying and toying around the edges of PBM issues. He told IndyStar it's been tough to make progress.

""Big picture wise, it appears we’re losing ground,"" Charbonneau said.

He also said he wasn't at all surprised to see an amendment curtailing it, given the well-funded special interests that surround this issue. Several members of the House insurance committee, too, work in the insurance field, including Carbaugh.

Carbaugh looks at that as a strength in coming up with a final product that balances legitimate business concerns with what would help lower costs for Hoosiers. Plus, he said he's not sure that the state trying to force multi-state companies to divest from their other businesses would hold up in court.

""To the extent that I think a bill may harm my clients, my constituents, I do consider that. But I think I should represent my constituents that way,"" he said. ""We do have to be careful. Sometimes we want to drop a hammer and a lot of things get broken in the process.""

What the amended bill does

Carbaugh sees the new version of the bill as tackling the competition issue in a free-market way. One example: If a self-insured company hires an insurer like Anthem to administer their health benefits, under this bill, Anthem will not be allowed to require that the employer use Anthem's preferred PBM, nor would Anthem be allowed to charge the employer more for using a different PBM.

He hopes this language will help PBMs that are not the big three or four actually get into the ring.

""We have 44 contracted PBMs in state of Indiana, and they can’t even compete for, I would say, decent-sized companies,"" he said.

A significant piece that remains in the bill, that was of great importance to mom-and-pop and independent pharmacists ― including the former pharmacist who now occupies a position in Gov. Mike Braun's cabinet ― is language ensuring PBMs do not under-reimburse pharmacists for the prescription drugs they acquire. And, it says PBMs can't reimburse pharmacies they own differently from pharmacies they don't own.

Independent pharmacists say this practice where PBMs under-reimburse pharmacists and pocket the profit, known as spread pricing, is what's led to 100 pharmacy closures in the last two years in Indiana.

And it's what leads Harry Webb, owner of Webb's Family Pharmacy in Rochester, to say that he might not be able to hand off his business to the next generation, despite operating in the small town since 1860.

""Who’s going to buy it?"" he said. ""I’m barely making money.""

Under this bill, beyond requiring PBMs to reimburse pharmacies at cost, it also provides pharmacies that do not sell alcohol a bonus ""dispensing fee"" as part of their reimbursement. The PBM industry likens these fees to a ""pill tax"" and asserts the extra costs will only be passed along to employers, and then likely to Hoosiers.

Rep. Robin Shackleford, D-Indianapolis, who helped with the amendment, said the idea is to give the smaller independent pharmacies a little boost, more so than the Krogers and Walmarts of the world that have pharmacies and sell alcohol.

""We do need to move toward everyone getting a dispensing fee,"" she said. ""But as for today, and what everyone is willing to accept, this is just a compromise.""

Charbonneau said it's likely that the Senate won't agree with the House's changes and that this will then get hammered out in a conference committee. As to whether the most drastic language has a chance of getting revived, at least a few weeks ago, Charbonneau gave it an optimistic 50/50 odds.

But one of the biggest obstacles tends to be just how complicated the space is.

""Six years ago I wanted to find out what happens when a bill goes off the Lilly production line and it goes into Ed’s mouth,"" he said. ""I still don’t know. ... This is an octopus with 40 tentacles.""

A majority of the EU’s 27 member states on Wednesday voted in favor of the penalties, some of which will start taking effect in mid-April. The tariffs will target politically sensitive American states and include products such as soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as diamonds, agricultural products, poultry and motorcycles.

The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said in a statement that the countermeasures can be suspended at any time “should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome.”

The move adds to the growing transatlantic trade war, with the US also having applied a universal 20% tariff on nearly all European exports as well as a separate 25% duty on cars and some auto parts. Trump has said he’ll announce additional tariffs on lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceutical products. All of Trump’s new tariffs are hitting around €380 billion of EU goods.

Some of the EU tariffs will take effect on April 15, while another list will be imposed mid-May and a third will start on Dec. 1, Bloomberg reported earlier. Most of the targeted goods face a 25% tariff level, with a few categories set to face 10% levies.

Bourbon was removed from the bloc’s list amid pressure from member states after Trump threatened 200% duties on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from France and elsewhere.

Trump has repeatedly attacked the EU, the US’s largest trading partner, saying it was formed to “screw” the US and that the bloc’s trade-in-goods surplus is evidence of an unfair relationship. The EU’s trade weighted average tariff rate was 2.7% in 2023, according to World Trade Organization data.

“They come up with rules and regulations that are just designed for one reason: that you can’t sell your product in those countries,” Trump said earlier this week. “And we’re not going to let that happen.”

The EU’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, discussed parameters of possible engagement on trade issues with his American counterparts late Tuesday, according a commission spokesperson. Talks have so far yielded little progress and US officials don’t appear to yet have a clear negotiating mandate from Trump, according to people familiar with the discussions.

The bloc’s executive arm is working on a “term sheet” of potential areas for negotiation, including lower tariffs, regulations and standards, Bloomberg previously reported.

Wednesday’s vote underscored the unity in EU capitals in the face of Trump’s escalating trade dispute. The American measures threaten to wipe out much of the euro-area expansion the European Central Bank forecasts for this year and next.

In addition, the commission, which handles trade matters for the bloc, is preparing a set of countermeasures to retaliate against the so-called reciprocal tariffs that went into effect Wednesday. The commission is planning to announce its plans early next week and then begin consultations with member states, a spokesperson said.

The universal tariffs are meant to target all the trade barriers US exports face abroad, such as duties, domestic regulations and taxes, including the value-added tax. Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen has previously said the EU “holds a lot of cards,” including retaliatory tariffs and targeting American services and technology companies.

France, Germany and other countries have called on the commission to consider deploying the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument — the EU’s most powerful trade tool, designed to strike back against nations that use trade and economic measures coercively, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The bloc still wants to find a negotiated solution to the tariff dispute but so far it has failed to engage in meaningful negotiations with the US administration.

EU-US Trade

For the EU, the fight over American metals tariffs started in 2018 during Trump’s first term, when the US hit nearly $7 billion of European steel and aluminum exports with duties, citing national security concerns. At the time, officials in Brussels scoffed at the notion that the EU posed such a threat.

In that first salvo, the US hit steel goods with 25% tariffs and aluminum with 10%, and included exemptions for certain products.

The 27-nation bloc reacted by targeting politically sensitive companies with retaliatory duties, including Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles and Levi Strauss & Co. jeans. The measures were applied product-by-product and included agricultural goods and apparel in addition to steel and aluminum products.

The two sides agreed to a temporary truce in 2021, when the US partly removed its measures and introduced a set of tariff-rate quotas above which duties on the metals are applied, while the EU froze all of its restrictive measures.

The marketplace’s share within that has nearly doubled in just one year. The platform serves as a catalyst for growth for Decathlon, both in Germany and beyond.

Globally, Decathlon achieved a revenue of 16.2 billion euros last year. Adjusted for inflation, this represents a 3.8 percent increase compared to the previous year.

Online revenue

Digital sales are becoming increasingly important for the French sporting goods retailer. Last year, 20 percent of its global revenue came from online sales, including ecommerce, in-store connected orders, and marketplaces – up from 17 percent in 2023. In Germany, however, the online share is significantly higher.

In its reports, Decathlon also emphasizes its focus on the importance of the planet and people. Despite sales growth, the company reduced its CO2 emissions last year. Additionally, it continues to employ more people, now with staff from 87 different nationalities. The proportion of women in the workforce has also increased.

Omnichannel strategy and marketplace

In a separate report on Germany, Decathlon attributes its positive revenue development to “the consistent implementation of its omnichannel strategy, which seamlessly integrates the digital and physical shopping experience”. The company also highlights “the remarkable development of the online marketplace”, which accounted for 20 percent of digital sales last year. For comparison: in 2023, this was 11 percent, and in 2022, just 7 percent.

Given that Decathlon’s German marketplace has not been active for very long, its rapid growth is not surprising. However, platform sales are exceeding expectations. It has become a catalyst for further profitable online growth, much like what has been seen with online marketplaces of MediaMarkt, Zalando and Otto.

Used sporting goods

Decathlon launched its marketplace for sellers in Belgium at the end of 2020, later expanding to the United Kingdom and other European countries, including Germany. Since last spring, selling partners have also been able to offer used sporting goods on Decathlon.de.

Growth spurts Levi’s brand was up 8 percent for the quarter.
Newer categories that offer a “denim lifestyle” like dresses, skirts and outerwear are also in growth mode, outpacing the rest of Levi’s business.
Levi Strauss & Co.’s plan to navigate President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs relies on an agile global supply chain and deep vendor relationships.
In the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call on","Levi Strauss & Co.’s plan to navigate President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs relies on an agile global supply chain and deep vendor relationships.

In the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call on Monday, Michelle Gass, LS&Co. president and chief executive officer, said the San Franscisco-based company’s ability to pivot will be key to how they address the issues in the short, medium and long term.

LS&Co. sources from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that are imported to the U.S. Companies in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam are among Levi’s top vendors—countries that Trump placed 10-49 percent “reciprocal” duties against on April 2.

Describing the situation as “fluid,” Harmit J. Singh, LS&Co.’s executive VP and chief financial and growth officer, said they’re the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategy.

“We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible,” he said.

For now, LS&Co.’s full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from Trump’s tariff spree. However, Gass mention three times during the call that almost 60 percent of the company’s revenue is generated outside the U.S., underscoring the value of its international business especially if the U.S. falls into a recession.

Singh said the Q2 outlook remains consistent with the company’s internal plan. “The effects of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter, as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in the U.S.,” he said, adding that Q2 is seasonally the company’s lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year.

In uncertain times, Levi’s leans on its heritage—a narrative that Gass highlighted during the call.

“As an iconic brand with more than 170 years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality. And that’s what Levi’s has always stood for,” she said.

Growth spurts

Levi’s brand was up 8 percent for the quarter. Sales in the U.S. increased 8 percent and international grew 9 percent, driven by growth in Mexico, the U.K., France and Germany. Two-third of the growth was led by units and a third by higher AUR.

Levi’s DTC-first strategy continues to gain momentum with DTC sales up 12 percent in Q1. DTC ended the quarter at 52 percent of total global net revenues, accounting for over half of the brand’s total revenue. New store openings in Italy, Mexico and India, a broad assortment of products and strong e-commerce sales supported this growth. Gass said AURs in the DTC channel are up mid-single digits as consumers gravitate to premium products. The brand also intentionally pulling back on promotions in Levi’s stores.

“DTC productivity actions, including improving the front-of-house consumer experience and back-of-house efficiency, are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel,” she said. “I see firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team.”

Online, the brand is working to elevate the consumer experience by upgrading the content on the site with higher quality imagery and enhanced storytelling. “We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our products in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for the U.S. e-com business rising to its highest level ever,” Gass said.

Wholesale business delivered another quarter of growth, up 5 percent. Gass said U.S. wholesale exceeded expectations in the quarter, up 9 percent, in part driven by door expansion and more space for Levi’s broadened lifestyle assortment.

Gass said the women’s category continued to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represent 38 percent of net revenues. Tops represents more than 20 percent of the heritage brand’s business, which has more than doubled over the last ten years.

Newer categories that offer a “denim lifestyle” like dresses, skirts and outerwear are also in growth mode, outpacing the rest of Levi’s business. Gass points out that while Levi’s remains the leader in jeans, the brand’s portfolio “beyond denim bottoms” comprises 35 percent of total sales.

In Q1, bottoms were up 9 percent. Gass attributed the success Levi’s achieved in volume to its fit diversification strategy.

“We have a style for everyone, for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15 percent of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Cinch Baggy, available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volumes surpassing 200 million,” she said.

Levi’s also introduced the 568 loose straight and the 578 baggy for men. “While there’s so much buzz around the loose and baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20 percent of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses,” Gass said.

“We are proud to call the Mitchell family our friends and partners for decades.
“We’re getting great support from our top vendors because they really believe this is our moment,” says third-generation co-CEO Bob Mitchell.
The women’s designer department of Mitchells in Westport, Conn., which offers everything from Celine to Yigal Azrouël.
“So, I went to Coach and worked in the North American outlet business, then to their parent company, Tapestry, before going to business school at Columbia.” There he took family business courses and even joined the university’s family business club.","In a precarious period of high-stakes retail roulette, what could a modestly sized 67-year-old family-owned-and-operated luxury retailer possibly teach larger, more established department stores about business? As it turns out, almost everything.

Founded in 1958 by husband-and-wife team Ed and Norma Mitchell, what would eventually become known as Mitchells Stores began as “Ed Mitchells” in an 800-square-foot former plumbing supply store in Westport, Connecticut, offering a curated collection of menswear. But the secret to the couple’s early success wasn’t predicated on the clothing they stocked—exactly three private label Doncaster suits and a small selection of shirts and sweaters by American manufacturers like C.H. Hathaway, Joseph & Feiss Co., and Cluett Peabody’s Arrow brand—instead, it was owed to deep community ties and a hot pot of coffee.

In 1979, Ed Mitchells expanded from an 800-foot former plumbing supply store to its current location in Westport, CT. The department store would later change its name to Mitchells.

Although it might sound like home-spun lore (or a calculated, albeit charming, public relations yarn) the Mitchells always started their day with a cup of coffee at home before Norma would brew a fresh pot to take into the store. “Back then, what was the first thing you’d do when someone stopped by your house,” asks Andrew Mitchell-Namdar, the brand’s third-generation owner and chief marketing officer. “You’d make them a cup of coffee.” It’s a tradition that has evolved over the years and across the retailer’s ever-expanding portfolio to include extensive coffee counters with high-tech Italian espresso machines and fully stocked bars offering everything from Champagne to specialty cocktails mixed in your fitting room.

Still, if you haven’t heard of Mitchells Stores, you’ve likely shopped in one. While beloved department stores like Barneys New York have become a distant memory and Saks Fifth Avenue was plotting to gobble up Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman as part of a $2.7 billion acquisition—and with the Nordstrom family preparing to take its eponymous 120-year-old department store chain private in a $6.25 billion deal—the Mitchells have steadily increased their retail footprint under the radar. Following the flagship’s move to its current Westport location in 1979, and a subsequent early ’90s expansion, the Mitchells acquired Richards in Greenwich, Conn. in 1995; bought Marshs in Huntington, New York, in 2005; became Wilkes Bashford’s succession plan with its acquisition of his namesake San Francisco and Palo Alto outposts in 2009; took over Marios’ Pacific Northwest stores in Seattle, Portland, and Bridgeport in 2015; and, just this month, announced the acquisition of Stanley Korshak in Dallas.

News about the family’s purchase of the fabled Uptown Dallas department store from its former owner, Crawford Brock, elicited praise from long-time Mitchells friend and vendor Brunello Cucinelli who says that both families “have exemplified the highest values in luxury retail, deeply rooted in the art of relationships, community and exceptional service” and that the union will “strengthen the American retail landscape.” The Paone family, owners of Kiton, also found it noteworthy, particularly given the state of relations between larger troubled retailers and their vendors. “We are proud to call the Mitchell family our friends and partners for decades. Their reputation for excellence, and relationships with designers from around the world, will perfectly expand and compliment the magnificent selections and experience at Stanley Korshak,” they offered in a statement.

It’s partly to that mix of reputation and relationships that the family attributes its continued prosperity. “We’ve had back-to-back record-breaking years, so we continue to believe in what we’re doing and all of us, as owners, feel confident that our formula is sound,” Mitchell-Namdar says about the company’s customer-first mentality and strategy of maintaining individual store identities within their portfolio. “We don’t change the brand names, we want to honor their histories—if you asked most Wilkes customers if they knew it was part of the now largest specialty chain in the United States, they probably wouldn’t.” Though it creates something of a branding challenge, the formula works. “We’re getting great support from our top vendors because they really believe this is our moment,” says third-generation co-CEO Bob Mitchell. “And, as brands are cutting back distribution, they’re choosing to be with us—we have no debt which is an important thing in this business today.”

When you consider the refinancing that Neiman Marcus underwent in 2021 to eliminate $4.4 billion of its nearly $5 billion total debt, what the Mitchells have achieved at their own scale, over the same period of time, is considerable. “Some of it is a surprise, but if you’ve been here as long as I have, you learn it’s not easy to predict what’ll happen tomorrow,” shares third-generation co-CEO Russ Mitchell about the company’s financial success. “But what you can do is be prepared to seize an opportunity when it happens—we’re poised to grow, but not at breakneck speed and we want to stay private.” It’s a sentiment shared by his brother. “We like to be very nimble,” says Mitchell-Namdar. “The best thing you can do is be ready. We were investing when other people weren’t, and that’s helped us to grow.”

In the early ’90s when brothers Bob and Russ joined the business under their father, second-generation owner Jack Mitchell, and their uncle Bill, the company was positioned for its first major pivot. “There was a big recession in 1991 and when we felt we were coming out of it, we decided to bring in womenswear in 1993, and the business really took off,” Bob says. “It was a big growth spurt early in my and Russ’s careers, and after that we decided to [acquire] Richards in Greenwich.” While the family continued to operate Richards as a menswear shop until 2000, Mitchells’ women’s collections cornered the Westport market: Armani, Escada, Dolce & Gabbana, Donna Karan, Jill Sander, Michael Kors, Missoni, and Ralph Lauren were but a few of the early designer accounts. “The business then was dressier, and we didn’t have the casual luxury we do today; it didn’t exist,” Bob adds. “But we’ve always responded to what our communities want.” Today, Mitchells carries an alphabet soup of top brands and designers, that resonate with its clientele, from Akris and Brioni to Valentino and Zegna.

“The Mitchell family has created one of America’s unique retail experiences, executed by few,” offered Ralph Lauren about the family’s business and emeritus chairman Jack Mitchell’s 2003 book, which chronicles the retailer’s philosophies and practices. “Their passion for the intimate relationship with the customer, and the loyalty that is created, has rarely been duplicated.” Giorgio Armani agreed. “[Jack] has always pursued this goal by focusing on the one real added value: the human factor. His achievements demonstrate how personal involvement and emotional stimulus are qualities you can’t do without.”

Even more than a cup of joe, it’s that connection to their clientele in each of their stores that has made all the difference for Mitchells. “We stock the shelves with what people buy, and if something isn’t selling, we stop carrying it,” says Bob. “It’s definitely been a metamorphosis to see the communities and luxury business change, but it’s the connection between luxury and personalized service that creates a great value proposition for our clientele.” When the family took over Wilkes Bashford there was concern about casualization and whether a younger customer would still want a high level of personal service, but the worry soon subsided. “In Palo Alto we started meeting these 30-year-olds who had all the money in the world, and they were consuming services more so than even our Connecticut customer, because they’d never had good service before,” explains Bob. “All of a sudden, they came in and had someone help them put together a great outfit, or tailor something, and then it was like, ‘Hey, can you pack for us.’” Though they weren’t buying suits, the thirty-something tech founders and investors were buying Brunello Cucinelli cashmere sweaters, sport coats, and five-pocket casual pants. “At that time, Brunello was the first to really capture what he called ‘sportivo chic’—a way to dress casually but still look like you’re sophisticated,” Bob says.

Technology has also played a major role the Mitchells’ success. One of the company’s game-changing tools is a proprietary internal app they developed that allows salespeople and management to communicate with each other and its patrons, and contains information on all the company’s shoppers, from contact details, birthdays and anniversaries to their alteration status, purchase history, and even what they were looking at on the website the night before. “There’s a daily feed gives you all the information you need to service your clients in the best way possible,” says Mitchell-Namdar. “With the ease of an iPhone you can text them right away, send them images, let them know their alterations are done—it creates a very robust little black book for sellers to proactively reach out.” The app also facilitates ways to locate an individual product on any salesfloor and, within seconds, direct its transfer to another store. “What we’re really good with is the back end,” adds fourth-generation owner Lyle Mitchell who, at 30 years old, joined in July 2023 as a business development and finance manager. “It’s where you get leverage by having sellers becoming better communicators, and we win at that.”

Brothers and second generation owners, Bill and Jack Mitchell in the early 2000s. Jack wrote Hug Your Customers, the best-selling book about the family’s business philosophies and practices.

Mitchells also has a hands-on e-concierge group aptly named after the founding matriarch, Norma, who focused on customer service, as well as a “Reserve in Store” service that allows clients to peruse the entire enterprise’s inventory online and have items shipped to their local store without committing to the purchase. “If someone reserves $10,000 worth of stuff, they’ll end up spending close to that, but they’re only buying about 30 percent of what they reserved,” Bob says. “We’ve found that people are bad pickers online and that’s why return rates are so high—but they still want to buy.”

As for the Mitchell family’s succession planning and its fourth generation, entering the business means following a structured protocol established to ensure active participation is the right fit. After five years post-college, during which time they’ve developed skills working for other companies in, and outside of, retail, interested family members can apply to open roles that suit their respective talents and interests. “I joined after my brother, Lyle, so he was the first to test out the policy” explains 28-year-old Dana Mitchell who worked in education with Teach for America and later in learning and development at Zegna and in sales for ski apparel brand Bogner, before joining the company in April 2024 as an assistant team lead at the Westport store. “Neither of us reports directly to family, which is great, and we have an advisory board to help us through the process.”

The Mitchells’ succession planning is in full swing. With the second generation comfortably retired, third- and fourth-generation owners are posed for continued growth.

It’s a system that works, particularly in the way it leverages an incoming family member’s interests and abilities. “I began in more traditional corporate finance, but in the healthcare sector, and knew that’s generally where I wanted to go long-term, but healthcare wasn’t for me,” says Lyle. “So, I went to Coach and worked in the North American outlet business, then to their parent company, Tapestry, before going to business school at Columbia.” There he took family business courses and even joined the university’s family business club. “Talking with other people and hearing their stories gave me an even greater appreciation for how special family business are, so I thought who better to learn from than my dad and Russ who are at the peak of their careers.”

From a cup of coffee and relationships built on trust to tactical technologies that only enhance human interactions, the Mitchells wrote the book on how to succeed in the luxury retail marketplace—and competitors might want to stop in for an espresso to get a read on how it’s done. “Customers may have a loyalty to certain brands, but their loyalty to people is stronger we think,” Russ explains. “There are always exceptions, but to most people, relationships with other people are stronger, so we’ll always maintain that as a core strategy.”","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1970b227-fcf9-4a76-b569-db8e235c4632.jpg?crop=1xw:1.0xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-04-09 11:12:07.803396

It was alleged Huawei, after being banned from working with TSMC, passed its AI chip designs to Sophgo, which in turn gave the blueprints to TSMC manufacture to order as if they were Sophgo's designs.
Sophgo would then give the finished chips to Huawei, without TSMC knowing, allowing Huawei to side-step American sanctions and acquire advanced semiconductors that should have been off limits, it was feared.
TSMC had previously manufactured Huawei's chips, including the Ascend series, up until the Chinese telecommunications titan was put on the US Entities List in 2019.
Huawei gave its AI accelerator chip designs to Sophgo, it's claimed.","TSMC could end up paying $1 billion or more to settle a US investigation into whether the Taiwanese outfit busted sanctions, inadvertently or not, by indirectly manufacturing AI accelerators for Huawei.

Citing two unnamed persons said to be familiar with the matter, Reuters on Tuesday reported the penalty could amount to as much as twice the value of transactions between TSMC and Chinese chip designer Sophgo last year.

As you may recall, Sophgo was accused in late 2024 of acting as a front for Huawei, which had been cut off from TSMC by US sanctions.

It was alleged Huawei, after being banned from working with TSMC, passed its AI chip designs to Sophgo, which in turn gave the blueprints to TSMC manufacture to order as if they were Sophgo's designs.

Sophgo would then give the finished chips to Huawei, without TSMC knowing, allowing Huawei to side-step American sanctions and acquire advanced semiconductors that should have been off limits, it was feared.

TSMC suspected this plan was afoot when Sophgo placed orders for a chip closely resembling Huawei's Ascend 910B AI accelerator, and raised the alarm to Uncle Sam.

As we've previously reported, the Ascend 910B is among Huawei's most-sophisticated processors, boasting performance roughly on par with a now five-year-old Nvidia A100, with 320 teraFLOPS of FP16 performance.

TSMC had previously manufactured Huawei's chips, including the Ascend series, up until the Chinese telecommunications titan was put on the US Entities List in 2019. Being on that list means you can't do business with or using American organizations and technologies without special permission from Uncle Sam, simply put.

Because TSMC relies on US tech to fabricate chips, those export controls extended to the Taiwanese corporation, and meant that as of 2020 Huawei could no longer source silicon dies from the foundry giant without permission from the United States.

These controls didn't however apply to Sophgo, a fabless chip designer specializing in the RISC-V instruction set, hence its role in the suspected scam. Although Sophgo denied the allegations of sanctions busting, US officials weren't buying it, and earlier this year Sophgo joined Huawei on the Entities List.

So to summarize:

Huawei had its top-end AI processor designs manufactured to order by TSMC's factories.

Huawei was cut off from TSMC as a supplier by US sanctions.

Huawei gave its AI accelerator chip designs to Sophgo, it's claimed.

Sophgo went to TSMC to have the chips manufactured, as if they were Sophgo's own designs, with the intention of quietly funneling the parts back to Huawei once completed, it's alleged.

TSMC, looking at the designs, thought they closely resembled Huawei's, put two and two together, cut off Sophgo, and alerted the US government of the suspected sanctions busting.

Despite blowing the whistle on the alleged shenanigans, it seems the Trump administration nonetheless intends to extract penalties from TSMC. This is despite the corporation's plans to expand US fab production to the tune of $100 billion, announced by CEO CC Wei alongside US President Donald Trump last month.

The reported penalties may be part of a broader crackdown by the US Bureau of Industry and Security on export violations.

""We will not allow adversaries to exploit American technology to bolster their own militaries and threaten American lives,"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month as part of another round of restrictions on AI exports. ""We are committed to using every tool at the Department's disposal to ensure our most advanced technologies stay out of the hands of those who seek to harm Americans.""

Alaska-based Carrs-Safeway will shut its store and pharmacy on Gambell Street in Anchorage on May 10, after nearly 70 years.

The store, managed by Carrs-Safeway, a subsidiary of Albertsons, has been a downtown staple since 1957.

Community advocates warn the closure will hit the Fairview neighborhood hard, as many residents lack cars and can't travel farther to buy essentials.

'It's devastating,' president of the Fairview Community Council James Thornton told Anchorage Daily News.

'The neighborhood needs this primary source of food, especially those that don't have vehicles.

'It's their only way to get food and medicine in a lot of cases.'

Longtime employee Richard Watt Jr. recalled starting at the store in 1964 as a box boy and later becoming its manager.

'It's a very sad day, the Carrs-Safeway on Gambell is the heartbeat of Fairview, so it's almost like cutting the heart out of the community,' he said of the closure.

'I just hope another store opens there after it closes.'

Watt's said he was hired by the store as its first black employee in Anchorage after picketing Carrs with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for not hiring people of color.

'I just heard and it's like, ""What? Oh no!""' Christina Anowlic, who has been shopping at the Gambell location since the 1980s told the Anchorage Daily News.

'It's kind of sad,' she added.

The 35 employees of the Gambell store will be given the option to transfer to other Carrs stores in the city, a spokesperson for Carrs-Safeway confirmed.

The pharmacists and prescriptions will be transferred to the Carrs pharmacy in the Midtown Mall on Seward Highway.

'Carrs-Safeway has been proudly serving Anchorage for decades, and the decision to close this store isn't one we made lightly,' the chain said in a statement.

'With our focus on growth, we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores, and occasionally it's necessary to close locations that are not growing and are perpetually unable to meet financial expectations.'

Carrs-Safeway will continue to operate its remaining seven stores in Anchorage.

'We're going to do everything we can to fight this, because I don't know how Fairview continues on without our Carrs store,' Thornton said.

'It's the original Carrs store in Anchorage and a lot of people love it. And the people that run it have done a great job supporting the community over the years.'

While the merger failed, the competition between Kroger and Albertsons has only intensified.","Once hailed as a potential retail revolution, the proposed Kroger–Albertsons merger was set to reshape the grocery industry in the United States. However, what began as a strategic partnership has now turned into a battle of narratives, legal hurdles, and public opinion. Once eyeing unity to challenge Walmart’s dominance, Kroger and Albertsons now find themselves at odds—not just with regulators, but with each other.

The $24.6 Billion Dream

In October 2022, Kroger announced its intent to acquire Albertsons for $24.6 billion, in a move that would have created a grocery powerhouse with over 5,000 stores and a customer base stretching coast to coast. The goal? Combine strengths, cut costs, and boost bargaining power in an increasingly competitive market dominated by Walmart, Amazon, and discount retailers.

Both companies framed the deal as a win-win for American consumers, promising better pricing, improved supply chain efficiency, and stronger competition. But almost from the start, the deal faced strong resistance.

FTC Says No – Consumer or Political Move?

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) blocked the merger in early 2024, citing concerns about reduced competition, higher food prices, and potential store closures in local markets. Critics feared that combining the second and fourth-largest supermarket chains in the U.S. would create regional monopolies, limit supplier options, and lead to job losses.

While Kroger and Albertsons offered to sell hundreds of stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers to ease antitrust concerns, the FTC remained unconvinced. The rejection sparked outrage from both sides, especially from Kroger’s leadership, who believed the move was more political than economic.

Cracks Begin to Show

With the deal off the table, what followed was not just disappointment—but growing tension. Legal teams, PR strategies, and shareholder interests quickly changed tone. What was once a shared vision became blame games and competing strategies.

Albertsons, having invested heavily in preparing for the merger, began to seek alternative partners or restructure internally. Kroger, meanwhile, redirected focus on its own operations, accelerating digital transformation, automation, and private label expansion.

From Allies to Enemies

Now, rather than joining forces, Kroger and Albertsons are locked in a silent war—for market share, supplier loyalty, talent, and future relevance.

Albertsons is reported to be revisiting previous plans to spin off parts of its business, while Kroger is leveraging its size and infrastructure to undercut regional rivals, possibly including Albertsons stores.

Insiders say both companies are now more aggressive in price wars, especially in overlapping markets like California, Colorado, and the Pacific Northwest.

Meanwhile, public perception has shifted: What was once seen as a bold merger is now being remembered as a failed alliance, with long-term consequences.

The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Retail?

This high-stakes fallout between Kroger and Albertsons highlights the broader uncertainty in U.S. retail. Consolidation is no longer guaranteed. Regulatory authorities are becoming more protective of competition, especially in essential sectors like food and health.

Consumers, too, are becoming more vocal—demanding lower prices, more choices, and ethical business practices. The Kroger-Albertsons saga is a lesson that bigger isn’t always better, especially in a highly regulated, politically sensitive environment.

Conclusion: What Now?

While the merger failed, the competition between Kroger and Albertsons has only intensified. Both companies now fight for dominance in a tough market where every dollar counts. What once looked like a marriage of giants is now a retail rivalry that will define the next chapter in American grocery.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-isn_corporation_logo-1-32x32.webp,N,,2025-04-09 11:11:10.760471

Supply chain interruptions reinforced its commitment to integration, but as its global presence expanded, so did its manufacturing footprint.
The first five stages—Invention, Production, Manufacturing at Scale, Vertical Integration, and Diversification—were key to Philips’ global success.
Identifying the right applications and optimizing the integration of these technologies could redefine how products are designed, manufactured, and distributed.
Let’s structure these cells to follow Philips’ successful trajectory—first achieving manufacturing at scale, then enabling vertical integration, leading to product diversification, and finally supporting overseas production.","“From sand to customer” was originally the business philosophy of Philips. The Dutch electronics firm was a pioneer in lightbulbs and later leveraged its expertise into X-ray tubes, radios, shavers, and cassettes. Initially, Philips outsourced many components or produced them overseas. For example, glass for its lamps was blown in Prague while the bulbs were manufactured in Eindhoven.

Philips began producing lightbulbs in Eindhoven in 1891, but it was only in 1916 that the company started blowing glass there. The interruption of pre-made glass supplies during World War I necessitated bringing this process in-house. Later, production in Prague and other locations resumed alongside Eindhoven before being cut off again by the Iron Curtain.

For many decades, Philips manufactured glass, lightbulbs, and tubes in Eindhoven. The company took in sand and transformed it into radios.

Philips was vertically integrated to an almost extreme degree. It not only produced and transported sand and other raw materials but also manufactured polymers, built injection molding machines, developed chips, and even created the machines used to produce those chips. The company made record players and operated its own recording studios. Supply chain interruptions reinforced its commitment to integration, but as its global presence expanded, so did its manufacturing footprint.

Local manufacturing was not driven by lower labor costs but by practical necessities such as tariffs and shipping challenges. Establishing production facilities worldwide ensured market access, allowing Philips to dominate emerging markets. By conducting R&D locally, it could attract the best minds globally. Operating within different regions also provided strategic advantages, enabling the company to better understand local markets, cultures, and needs. For instance, Philips developed spice grinders specifically for India and hand-cranked radios for Indian servicemen stationed in remote bases with limited access to power.

However, in later years, the company shifted its focus to outsourcing primarily to cut costs. Once a co-inventor of groundbreaking technologies like the CD, cassette, and LED—and a founding force behind industry giants such as TSMC and ASML—Philips lost its way. Without a clear vision, decisive leadership, or the willingness to make bold choices, it ran out of momentum. Once legendary for its design and marketing, it became uninspired and ordinary.

Its strong social instincts made it bloated and complacent, lacking the drive and daring that had once defined it. In its early years, Philips was fearless—so much so that, after the Dutch Queen was involved in a minor car accident, the company sent a letter to her secretary suggesting that the accident could have been avoided had Philips street lamps been installed. At one point, after nearly being pushed out of the lightbulb business, Philips resorted to industrial espionage to imitate U.S. firms. It once had guts, ambition, and even questionable ethics. But over time, it became slow, timid, and visionless.

Philips invested in commercializing a wide range of innovations, from MRI machines and street lighting to body shavers. However, it failed to grant its divisions the autonomy, resources, and capital needed to compete effectively in these diverse markets. The company was unprepared for the commoditization of technology, the rise of low-cost brands, the shift to e-commerce, and the resurgence of premium brands.

A series of ineffective CEOs further weakened the company, and poor leadership ultimately transformed it into a medical innovation firm—yet one that lost its commitment to quality and innovation. Instead of a cohesive organization, Philips became a fragmented collection of loosely connected units.

Deep job cuts did little to address the real problem: leadership that failed to recognize the significance of Apple, the internet, mobile phones, and the decline of big-box retail. Worse still, they failed to adjust course to navigate this new reality. With a brand that, while trusted, lacked strength, and an outdated understanding of the world, Philips gradually faded into a shadow of its former self. By delaying difficult decisions for too long, the company left itself with few good options.

NXP now has a market cap twice that of Philips, while ASML is ten times larger, and TSMC is approaching a trillion-dollar valuation. Many companies today resemble Philips in its later years—hesitant to make tough decisions, out of touch with customers, and failing to deliver products the world truly needs.

Countless firms have been commodified, yet they are the only ones who fail to recognize it. Volkswagen’s strategy of producing a car for every niche mirrors Nokia’s once-dependable but ultimately misguided approach. Stellantis is teetering on the edge, while many Mittelstand companies are running on fumes, struggling to compete with rising Chinese manufacturers.

If we view Philips’ rise and fall as a series of distinct phases, we might categorize them as follows: Invention, Production, Manufacturing at Scale, Vertical Integration, Diversification, Overseas Production, Lethargy, Blind Cost Cutting, and Sclerosis.

The first five stages—Invention, Production, Manufacturing at Scale, Vertical Integration, and Diversification—were key to Philips’ global success. These, combined with a strong identity, clear values, adaptability, and an openness to opportunity, formed the foundation of its dominance. The question is: can we replicate this success in a self-contained, modular form using 3D printing?

Can we develop a modular production environment capable of generating most of a product’s value within a monolithic system? Given today’s global supply chains, where components come from all over the world, this is only feasible for select products. However, there are still many cases where value can be created through the integration of a few automated technologies working in unison within a cell-like production system.

Imagine a system that integrates directed energy deposition (DED), water jetting, CNC milling, and laser powder bed fusion—a tightly coordinated unit capable of handling complex manufacturing tasks in a way that is more versatile, cost-effective, and adaptive than traditional methods. The key is to move beyond the OEM mindset. Just because you sell oranges doesn’t mean you should be limited to making orange juice or only products containing orange juice. I don´t care about your bonus, I care about my future. Think of a production cell, like those used for turbine blisk repair, but with a broader range of integrated technologies—one that doesn’t just scan, mill, and apply DED but incorporates additional complementary processes.

The concept of an automated production cell capable of manufacturing a wide range of products—from car seats and office chairs to armor and boat hulls—is a compelling evolution of manufacturing. These modular, flexible cells would require significant upfront investment but minimal manual labor, offering adaptability across products, geographies, and economic conditions. Their plug-and-play nature, enabled by commodity materials and quick calibration, would allow rapid deployment in response to shifting political and tariff landscapes.

This approach transforms manufacturing into a dynamic system rather than a static factory. A single cell could pivot between different products, adjust to new iterations, and evolve with market demands. By integrating multiple 3D printing technologies with automated conveyancing, scanning, CNC milling, and other processes, these production cells could create value in ways that standalone 3D printers never could.

The opportunity here is enormous—on the scale of Philips at its peak. Identifying the right applications and optimizing the integration of these technologies could redefine how products are designed, manufactured, and distributed. The ability to scale, shrink, retool, and relocate production at will makes this model resilient and future-proof.

While 3D printing alone was never the magic bullet for fully automated, end-to-end manufacturing, combining it with other technologies in a self-contained, mobile production system could make it work. Let’s structure these cells to follow Philips’ successful trajectory—first achieving manufacturing at scale, then enabling vertical integration, leading to product diversification, and finally supporting overseas production.

Customers can expect grocery prices to increase “in the next couple of weeks,” said John Ross, the CEO of IGA, a chain of independent grocery stores.
Shoppers are pulling back Grocery prices already frustrated customers before tariffs.
Grocery prices overall have increased around 23% since 2021, with prices on individual items like coffee and chocolate rising much faster.","President Donald Trump, during his announcement last week of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world, called groceries an “old-fashioned” and “beautiful term.” But his policies will make America’s groceries more expensive today, supermarket executives and food industry experts say.

Supermarkets sell imported items in every section of the store: from fresh and packaged foods to household basics. Trump instituted 10% tariffs across all countries last Saturday and slapped higher reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries and trading blocs today. US businesses shipping goods from overseas will pay for those tariffs, and they will pass some of the higher costs down to consumers.

Shoppers can expect to see prices rise on seafood, coffee, fruit, cheese, nuts, candy bars and other imported foods, according to experts. Items that contain ingredients and packaging like plastic and aluminum from other countries will also be hit. Perishable food prices will rise first, followed by shelf-stable goods. Customers may also see smaller-sized products, known as shrinkflation, and find that certain versions of items have been eliminated as companies try to offset their cost hikes from tariffs.

Customers can expect grocery prices to increase “in the next couple of weeks,” said John Ross, the CEO of IGA, a chain of independent grocery stores. “Shoppers will start seeing it at scale across the store in the next 90 days.”

Food prices will rise 2.8% overall from Trump’s tariffs, including 4% for fresh produce, Yale University’s Budget Lab estimates. The cost burden will hit lower-income shoppers, who spend a greater share of their income on essentials, the hardest.

Hit to smaller companies first

The scale of the price hikes will also depend on the size of the companies.

Prices at smaller grocers, which have less flexibility to absorb higher costs than giant chains like Walmart and Costco, may rise faster. Big food suppliers such as Campbell and Kraft Heinz also have more flexibility to manage tariffs than smaller producers. But few companies will be spared from the effects.

“It appears that the small distributors are reacting a lot more quickly,” said Steve Schwartz, the director of sales and marketing at grocery chain Morton Williams. Small distributors have less supply on hand and will raise prices first, while larger companies with more inventory in warehouses can wait longer, Schwartz said.

For example, one Italian importer that supplies olive oil and balsamic vinegar notified Morton Williams of a 20% price increase next month.

Randy Arceneaux, the CEO Affiliated Foods, a wholesaler in Amarillo, Texas servicing around 700 independent grocery stores in eight states, said that most suppliers are still waiting to see what happens with tariffs.

But that’s not the case with all Affiliated Food’s suppliers —several have already notified the company of price increases because of tariffs, including bananas and canned tuna, as well as plastic utensils.

Affiliated Foods sources bananas from Guatemala, where Trump implemented a 10% tariff. Affiliated Foods’ distributor notified the company that a 10% price increase will go into effect next week.

This will increase Affiliated Foods’ costs by 4 cents per banana case, from $1.80 to $1.84, which will be passed on to shoppers.

Global supply chain

The foods Americans eat are part of a complicated global supply chain, with much of the growing impossible to replicate stateside because of climate and crop conditions. Food that can’t be grown locally will see the biggest rise in prices.

Currently, the US imports approximately 17% of all food and beverages consumed by Americans, but it varies dramatically by category. For example, around 80% of seafood, 80% of coffee, 59% of fresh fruit and 35% of vegetables consumed in the United States are imported, according to the Department of Agriculture.

“Our food system is intricately linked with global markets − including products not grown in the United States like bananas or seasonal items − which helps keep prices down while providing American shoppers year-round access to safe, nutritious food,” Leslie Sarasin, the president of food industry group FMI, said in a statement last week.

But one major factor that could limit price increases is that Mexico and Canada were left off Trump’s latest tariff list. Mexico and Canada are the two largest agricultural suppliers to the United States, according to the Agriculture Department.

The White House has slapped 25% tariffs on those countries, but most food and agricultural products are exempt from tariffs under the existing USMCA free trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Shoppers are pulling back

Grocery prices already frustrated customers before tariffs. Trump said he won the 2024 election in large part due to the price of groceries.

Grocery prices overall have increased around 23% since 2021, with prices on individual items like coffee and chocolate rising much faster.

That’s caused shoppers to pull back. PepsiCo, Campbell and JM Smucker reported weak sales of their snack brands in recent earnings announcements, and tariffs will likely only accelerate the slowdown.

PepsiCo, the owner of Frito-Lay, said last month that people bought 3% fewer snacks last quarter.

“Salty and savory snack categories underperformed” the broader packaged food industry, PepsiCo said, citing the “cumulative impacts of inflationary pressures and higher borrowing costs on consumer budgets.”

Household staples, such as dish detergent, paper towels and cosmetics, have also seen a slowdown in recent weeks, according to market research firm Circana.

“Some consumers are moving away from discretionary spending” at the grocery store, said Sally Lyons Wyatt, Circana’s chief advisor for the consumer goods and food service industries.

More shoppers are taking quicker, smaller trips to stores, and switching to stores’ cheaper private-label brands, she said. These are signs that customers are watching their budgets more carefully.

Customers “are still showing that willingness to spend, but they’re being very choiceful where they’re spending,” Costco finance chief Gary Millerchip said last month.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2055599831-20250408193842627.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-04-09 11:11:51.224968

Additionally, as Instacart’s advertising business matures, it may benefit from economies of scale and improved efficiency, potentially leading to even higher margins over time.","Instacart, the leading digital intermediary in the US grocery market, continues to navigate a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges as it seeks to maintain its dominant position in the evolving online grocery sector. The company demonstrates strong financial health, earning a ""GREAT"" rating from InvestingPro’s comprehensive assessment system, with particularly robust scores in growth and cash flow metrics. With a market share of 70-75% in third-party grocery delivery, the company, operating under Maplebear Inc. (NASDAQ: ), has established itself as a crucial player in the $1.1 trillion US grocery industry. However, recent analyst reports suggest that while Instacart’s foundation remains strong, it faces increasing pressure from competitors and market dynamics that could impact its growth trajectory.

Business Model and Market Dynamics

Instacart’s core business revolves around facilitating grocery delivery and pickup services through partnerships with over 85,000 stores across 1,500 retail banners. This extensive network covers more than 85% of the US grocery market, providing the company with a significant competitive advantage. The platform generates revenue through transaction fees and a growing advertising business, leveraging its vast customer base and data insights to attract consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands.

Analysts note that the online grocery market is projected to grow at a 12% three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). However, some estimates suggest Instacart’s growth may lag behind this market expansion. Deutsche Bank projects a more modest 6.6% CAGR for Instacart from 2023 to 2028, highlighting the challenges the company faces in a competitive landscape.

Financial Performance and Growth Strategies

Recent financial results have shown mixed signals for Instacart. While the company’s stock has declined about 15% over the past six months, its fundamental performance remains strong, with an impressive 75.25% gross profit margin and positive earnings of $1.58 per share in the last twelve months. The company reported solid performance in its latest quarters, with gross transaction value (GTV) and EBITDA often exceeding guidance. For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Instacart reported GTV at the high end of guidance and EBITDA $12 million above the high-end of guidance.

Instacart’s growth strategy focuses on several key areas:

1. Expanding its advertising business: The company aims to increase its advertising take rate from approximately 2.9% in 2024 to over 4% in the long term. This expansion is crucial for improving profitability and offsetting competitive pressures in the delivery market.

2. Affordability initiatives: To drive GTV growth, Instacart is working on making grocery delivery more cost-effective through low-cost delivery options and collaborations with merchants to reduce prices.

3. New product offerings: The company is exploring innovative solutions such as Caper Carts, which aim to enhance the in-store shopping experience and potentially open new revenue streams.

4. Strategic partnerships: Instacart’s recent collaboration with Uber (NYSE: ) to include restaurant deliveries demonstrates its efforts to diversify and expand its service offerings.

Challenges and Risks

Despite its strong market position, Instacart faces several significant challenges:

1. Competitive pressure: Well-funded rivals like Walmart (NYSE: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), DoorDash (NASDAQ: ), and Uber are intensifying competition in the digital grocery space. These competitors often have more flexibility to address affordability issues, potentially outpacing Instacart in market share growth.

2. Advertising revenue risks: Instacart’s reliance on advertising for profitability exposes it to risks from persistent CPG budget pressures and competition. Some analysts suggest that growth expectations for this segment may be overestimated by the market.

3. Affordability concerns: Instacart’s pricing remains higher than some competitors, which could limit its ability to attract and retain price-sensitive customers, especially in an inflationary environment.

4. Market saturation and adoption rates: As the online grocery market matures, Instacart may face challenges in maintaining its high growth rates, particularly if consumer adoption of online grocery shopping slows post-pandemic.

Bear Case

How might increasing competition from well-funded rivals impact Instacart’s market share?

The intensifying competition in the digital grocery space poses a significant threat to Instacart’s market dominance. Companies like Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash, and Uber have substantial resources and established customer bases that they can leverage to expand their grocery delivery services. These competitors often have more flexibility in their pricing strategies and can potentially offer lower prices to consumers, which could erode Instacart’s market share over time.

Moreover, these rivals have diverse business models that allow them to subsidize their grocery delivery services with profits from other segments. This financial flexibility enables them to invest heavily in marketing, technology, and customer acquisition, potentially outpacing Instacart’s growth. As a result, Instacart may find it increasingly challenging to maintain its current market share and could see a gradual decline in its dominant position if it fails to effectively counter these competitive pressures.

What are the risks associated with Instacart’s reliance on advertising revenue for profitability?

Instacart’s growing dependence on advertising revenue for profitability exposes the company to several risks. First, the advertising market, particularly in the CPG sector, is subject to economic fluctuations and budget constraints. Any downturn in CPG advertising spending could significantly impact Instacart’s profitability.

Additionally, as the digital advertising landscape becomes more saturated, Instacart may face challenges in maintaining its ad load and effectiveness. Some analysts have expressed concerns that the company’s advertising growth expectations may be overly optimistic, given the maturing ad load across key categories and potential headwinds in the CPG industry.

Furthermore, relying heavily on advertising revenue could create conflicts between maximizing ad placements and maintaining a positive user experience. If Instacart pushes too aggressively on advertising, it risks alienating customers and potentially driving them to competitors with less intrusive shopping experiences.

Bull Case

How could Instacart’s market leadership and extensive partnerships drive future growth?

Instacart’s dominant position in the US grocery delivery market, with a 70-75% share in third-party delivery, provides a strong foundation for future growth. The company’s extensive network of partnerships with over 85,000 stores across 1,500 retail banners gives it unparalleled reach and scale in the industry. This expansive coverage allows Instacart to offer a wide variety of products and services to consumers, enhancing its value proposition and making it a go-to platform for online grocery shopping.

The company’s market leadership also translates into significant data advantages. With access to vast amounts of consumer shopping data, Instacart can continually refine its algorithms, improve personalization, and enhance the overall customer experience. This data-driven approach could lead to increased customer loyalty, higher order frequencies, and larger basket sizes, all of which contribute to sustained growth.

Moreover, Instacart’s strong relationships with retailers position it well to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards online grocery shopping. As more traditional grocers seek to establish or expand their e-commerce capabilities, Instacart’s proven platform and expertise make it an attractive partner. This could lead to deeper integrations with existing partners and new partnership opportunities, further solidifying Instacart’s market position and driving growth.

What potential does the expansion of Instacart’s advertising business have for improving profitability?

The expansion of Instacart’s advertising business presents a significant opportunity for improving profitability. The company aims to increase its advertising take rate from approximately 2.9% in 2024 to over 4% in the long term, which could substantially boost its revenue and margins.

Instacart’s large and engaged user base makes it an attractive platform for CPG brands looking to reach consumers at the point of purchase. As the company continues to refine its advertising offerings and targeting capabilities, it could capture a larger share of CPG advertising budgets, which are increasingly shifting towards digital channels.

Furthermore, advertising revenue typically comes with higher margins compared to transaction fees, meaning that growth in this segment could disproportionately improve Instacart’s overall profitability. The company’s efforts to expand its retail media network (RMN) inventory and enhance in-store advertising capabilities could open up new revenue streams and further drive profitability.

Additionally, as Instacart’s advertising business matures, it may benefit from economies of scale and improved efficiency, potentially leading to even higher margins over time. This could provide the company with additional resources to invest in technology, customer acquisition, and new product development, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and profitability.

Group like-for-like (LFL) sales rose by just 0.3% for the year, but fell 2.5% in the UK.
BRC chairman Andrew Higginson warned that if US President Donald Trump’s tariffs remain at their current levels, prices are likely to increase.
Investors have been spooked by the uncertainty, with JD Sports’ stock price slumping nearly 11% since early April as fears over the tariff effects mounted.
JD Sports CEO Régis Schultz said: “We have delivered a solid performance in a challenging market, with organic revenue growth of 5.8% for the year.","JD Sports has met full-year profit expectations but cautioned that the year ahead will be challenging due to market volatility and tariff uncertainty.

For the 52 weeks to 1 February 2025, the sportswear giant reported a 5.8% organic sales growth, slightly ahead of guidance, with profit before tax and adjusting items falling within the range of £915m to £935m.

Group like-for-like (LFL) sales rose by just 0.3% for the year, but fell 2.5% in the UK. Europe and Asia Pacific delivered strong performances, with Q4 LFLs up 11.4% and 7.5% in North America.

As a result, JD Sports said it expects FY26 pre-tax profit to be in line with current consensus estimates of £920m, although this excludes any impact from proposed changes to tariffs, which the retailer said were still too uncertain to quantify.

BRC chairman Andrew Higginson warned that if US President Donald Trump’s tariffs remain at their current levels, prices are likely to increase.

Speaking on the Today programme, Higginson commented that it’s “unlikely” shoe production will shift to the US, but noted the outcome “depends on how high the tariffs are and for how long.”

JD Sports, which sources much of its goods from Asia, has been affected by concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported products, especially those made in countries like China and Vietnam.

Investors have been spooked by the uncertainty, with JD Sports’ stock price slumping nearly 11% since early April as fears over the tariff effects mounted.

JD Sports CEO Régis Schultz said: “We have delivered a solid performance in a challenging market, with organic revenue growth of 5.8% for the year. This reflects the continued strength of our multi-channel consumer proposition and our growing international footprint.

“We remain focused on profitable growth and maintaining trading discipline, despite an environment that remains promotional and unpredictable in key markets.

“As we enter FY26, we do so with momentum in our core regions and a clear plan to unlock further scale and efficiency across the business.”

By segment, the retailer’s core JD fascia recorded FY25 organic revenue growth of 7.1%, with sporting goods and outdoor categories also delivering solid gains.

It said recent acquisitions Hibbett and Courir traded in line with expectations, contributing to the 1,533-store increase over the year and supporting total store count growth to 4,850.s.

Looking ahead, JD Sports said its sales are expected to grow in by around 14% in its current financial year as a result of acquisitions and new space, though like-for-likes are expected to dip below FY25 levels.

The company plans to open around 150 new stores in FY26, alongside 100 conversions or relocations and 50 closures, largely in Eastern Europe.",https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shutterstock_1953605767.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 12:20:36.299438

The Washington Post: What Goes Into The Algorithm Behind Machine Learning For Health Care

The human body constantly generates a variety of signals that can be measured from the outside with wearable devices. These bio-signals — which include heart rate, sleep state and blood oxygen levels — can indicate whether someone is having mood swings or be used to diagnose a variety of bodily and brain disorders. It can be relatively cheap to gather a lot of bio-signal data. To teach a machine-learning algorithm to find a relationship between bio-signals and health outcomes, however, you need to teach the algorithm to recognize those health outcomes. That’s where research scientists like myself come in. (Geenjaar, 4/8)

Starbucks has pinpointed the drink as a key player in its plan to evolve the RTD portfolio and appeal to shifting consumer preferences—especially among a younger generation of self-expressive trendsetters. With the RTD market booming, there's certainly no room for blending in.

""RTD is a crucial sector for us to reinforce our coffee leadership position in China,"" says Catrina Xiaoyu Wang, senior manager at Starbucks China. ""As an exciting and disruptive extension to our line, Refreshers is designed to drive penetration, recruiting new users and boosting our ambition to become the most loved RTD coffee brand in the market.""

The rebrand brings a sense of freshness and flair that matches the product's personality. It's aimed squarely at what Marks identifies as 'life autonomists'—Gen Z consumers who embrace individuality, community, and aesthetics and whose drinks are an extension of personal style.

According to Danny Lye, vice president of Marks Greater Asia, the result is ""disruptive and eye-catching,"" with a distinctive visual language that blends elegance, energy, and sensory appeal.

Marks' approach was rooted in local consumer insight and cultural semiotics. The team drew on emerging design trends like expressive abstract patterns, playful illustrations, and vibrant colour cues to build a system that feels premium yet personal.

In other words, this isn't just another pretty bottle—it's a deliberate play on shelf impact and emotional connection, aligning with how China's younger generation navigates the intersection of food, fashion, and self-image.

At the centre of the redesign is a unique bottle structure that feels as good as it looks. Inspired by the texture of fresh fruit and the tactile charm of traditional coffee equipment (notably the iconic Italian Moka pot), the shape delivers both a functional and aesthetic punch.

Design-wise, the label balances familiarity with flair. Key Starbucks RTD equities remain intact, anchoring the product within the broader brand portfolio, but fresh elements elevate the experience. This includes playful hand-drawn typography for flavour names, vibrant colour systems tailored to local preferences, and expressive neck patterns that catch the eye and spark curiosity.

""Together, bottle and graphics deliver an unexpectedly refreshing visual and sensory experience,"" says Lye. ""They mark a significant investment to position the product as a disruptor in RTD beverage, offering excitement and newness in an extremely competitive environment.""

The launch is being rolled out with an e-commerce campaign titled Morning Coffee, Afternoon Refreshers—a neat nod to the product's dual appeal as a midday pick-me-up with a playful twist. It's not just about delivering caffeine; it's about delivering a moment.

This project is a clear example of what Marks does best: combining brand strategy, semiotics, structural design, and storytelling into a cohesive, culturally attuned identity. As the line between lifestyle and beverage continues to blur, Starbucks and Marks are meeting the moment with a bottle that's as expressive as the people holding it.",https://www.creativeboom.com/upload/articles/e4/e4c7c3656d8957d67f97b29991618f22ec3e7adb_800.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:42.864222

NEEDHAM, Mass. – PC shipments during the first quarter of 2025 grew 4.9% from the prior year, with global volumes reaching 63.2 million shipments, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker. Looking ahead to 2025, the PC industry has several tailwinds and headwinds, which make for a challenging outlook and difficult demand planning.

“The market is clearly showing some level of pull-in in the first quarter this year as both vendors and end-users brace for the impact of US tariffs. In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “Evidently, commercial demand remained strong in the first quarter, but the new round of US tariffs announced on April 2nd could have a direct inflationary impact on the PC market that could result in delayed IT spending for the remainder of the year”.

Most of the underlying demand factors for PCs, such as the installed base upgrade ahead of Windows 10 end of support, and demand for on-device AI, remain strong, as illustrated by the volumes shipped in Q1 2025. However, the uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and associated inflationary pressure and global recessionary risks will negatively impact demand for PCs in the following quarters in 2025.

“While many are still unpacking the details from the April 2nd tariff announcement, it’s safe to say most are reevaluating what the following months will look like,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers. “So far, our supply chain checks haven’t shown any drastic shifts, but this isn’t surprising as it’s almost too volatile to make drastic business decisions. Companies are undoubtedly evaluating everything from inventory on hand, capacity to manufacture by location, possible reroute opportunities to lower import tariffs, and for some, their deal discussions with the US administration. When it comes to hardware like PCs and similar devices, we still maintain the view that most (if not all) price increases will get passed directly to the consumer.”

Recent analysis from the independent think tank Ember points out that by 2030, a significant portion of the European fossil gas capacity could be under-utilised, while diverting financial resources away from long-term investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures (6).
In all International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios, the peak demand for fossil gas, including for electricity production, is expected before 2030 (7).
Hence, building new gas plants, whose lifespan ranges from 25 to 40 years, is incoherent with this trend, especially in areas like Europe.
Local communities are warning that new gas-fired power stations pose a risk to people’s health as well as serious local and global environmental impacts, resulting in opposition at many of the planned sites.","Not one of the ten European power companies (3), analyzed for the new Power Transition Tracker, has published a clear plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and seven of the companies intend to carry on burning gas well into the future, including building new gas-fired power stations in Europe, even though the role of gas in Europe must be significantly reduced in the near future.(4)

In total, the seven utilities (EPH, ENGIE, Enel, RWE, PGE, A2A and SSE) plan to build or are already building at least 37 new gas-fired plants, with financial support from major European banks and investors including Barclays, BBVA, Société Générale, ING, NatWest and PKO Bank Polski (5). This will result in more than 25 gigawatts (GW) of new fossil gas capacity.

All but one of these planned plants are in Europe. Recent analysis from the independent think tank Ember points out that by 2030, a significant portion of the European fossil gas capacity could be under-utilised, while diverting financial resources away from long-term investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures (6).

In all International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios, the peak demand for fossil gas, including for electricity production, is expected before 2030 (7). This is especially the case in advanced economies where demand is already decreasing (8). Hence, building new gas plants, whose lifespan ranges from 25 to 40 years, is incoherent with this trend, especially in areas like Europe.

Local communities are warning that new gas-fired power stations pose a risk to people’s health as well as serious local and global environmental impacts, resulting in opposition at many of the planned sites.

EPH is planning to convert a coal-fired unit to gas in Fiume Santo in Sardinia, Italy, generating 560 MW. The project has been delayed due to questions about Sardinia’s transition, including related plans to develop a gas network and build two Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU) for LNG import/export (9).

ENGIE is also facing local opposition to its plans for a new gas plant in Nijmegen in the Netherlands. The company claims the plant will eventually be converted to hydrogen, but campaigners question whether this is viable, given the limited availability of green hydrogen and the efficiency of using hydrogen to generate power (10).",https://reclaimfinance.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Power-transition-Tracker-.png,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:27.580264

While largely focused on the technical side of the Google Cloud offering, several developments speak to how brands and agencies can use AI to power marketing and customer experience applications.

“Consumer expectations are constantly changing, and this is creating pressure, both for market share and margin dynamics in the [retail] industry,” said Carrie Tharp, vice president for global solutions and industries at Google Cloud, in a press briefing in advance of the conference taking place April 9-11.

Along with what Tharp calls “crazy uncontrollables” like the Trump administration’s recently announced tariff plan, marketers must grapple with customer journeys getting longer — the average consumers has 10 touchpoints on their journey to purchase. Those journeys are also feeling more fraught: Two in three consumers delay or avoid purchase decisions when they have too much information. AI could provide a way forward.

“If consumers have confidence in the brand and the product, they are much more likely to recommend that to their customers, so how are we going to apply AI to help this overall pressure dynamic?” the executive asked.

Eight weeks into eight hours

Google Cloud news this week includes that it will add Lyria, its text-to-music model, to Vertex AI, making the platform the only one to offer generative media models across video, image, speech and music. Lyria can help create soundtracks for marketing campaigns, product launches or in-store experiences, as well as enabling the creation of sonic branding, per the company. The ability to quickly create custom music tracks saves on time and the cost of searching for royalty-free music.

Brands are already using Vertex to increase efficiency throughout the marketing process. L'Oréal Groupe is using Vertex’s Veo tool for video generation and the Imagen tool for image generation to speed up the creation of high-quality assets, which is impacting how the company views creativity.

“These models act as powerful creative partners, empowering our teams to experiment with new ideas and respond to the market. We’re expanding our qualitative video and image production across 20 additional countries and languages, all while upholding to our trustworthy AI values,” said Thomas Ménard, manager of AI center enablement at L'Oréal Groupe, in a statement.

Kraft Heinz is also using Veo and Imagen tools as part of its Tastemaker platform, bringing speed and efficiency to creative workflows — doing work that once took eight weeks in only eight hours.

“Implementing Google Cloud AI within our platform that is deeply trained on our brand intelligence, allows innovation and creative teams to rapidly prototype, test and deploy content, transforming how we bring our iconic brands to life,” said Justin Thomas, head of digital experience and growth at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.

Boosting creative ROI

Elsewhere, Google Cloud’s Creative Agents are being used to boost creative teams in media production, marketing, advertising, design and beyond. WPP used agents as part of its Open platform, while Monks.Flow is using Google AI to help localize campaign creative and the Brandtech Group built a generative AI platform, Pencil, to help brands create ads, predict performance and optimize campaigns.

Mondelez, which in 2024 launched a new AI platform supported by Accenture and Publicis Groupe, is looking to notch a 25% ROI using generative AI for content and creative development at brands including Oreo and Cadbury.

“You are seeing many big platforms, retailers and brand, begin to dabble with what this looks like, and we have many products for them to apply,” Google Cloud’s Tharp explained. “We have large consumer packaged goods companies with very high standards and brands are now able to use image generation and video generation to get to truly one-to-one marketing.”

Papa Johns announced last week a partnership with Google Cloud to use Google data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence chatbots in its ordering and delivery processes. The pizza chain is also expected to use AI to create marketing campaigns that can deliver personalized offers, content and timing based on preferences. The Papa Johns partnership speaks to how marketers and related professionals can use a host of Google Cloud tools in tandem.

“Whether you're a merchant, a store associate, a marketer or somebody who works in analytics, we want to make sure we simplify the dynamic of all of these language models, the different agents… you could be interacting with and all of the generative tools, and put that power in your hand in your day-to-day processes,” Tharp said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IyfNe7Qzmm3OQDK5ON506-6epBBGKGQMKgNCzlP-nWg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjUxOTEzMTg3X0x2bExTWTIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-04-09 10:07:01.817449

Overall vacancy rose to 8%, up 70 basis points for the quarter and 130 basis points year-over-year. While leasing activity was strong in Q1, CBRE attributed the increased vacancy rate to an influx of new speculative space in the market.

All of the positive absorption was in the warehouse category as flex absorption was negative 22,000 square feet.

The biggest new tenants for Triad industrial property were SBA Group, a Lithuanian furniture maker that took 500,000 SF of space in a former Gildan building in Mocksville in Davie County, and Lenovo, which is now occupying 200,000 SF at 6550 Judge Adams Road in Whitsett in southeast Guilford County.

Other significant new leasing deals including LeBleu taking 130,492 SF at 228 Quality Drive in Mocksville and Imperial Dade leasing 119,265 SF at 1615 Piedmont Commerce Drive in the PTI Airport submarket.

In addition, two companies renewed leases for large spaces in the PTI Airport submarket, with Mohawk Carpet keeping its 357,126-square-foot space at 6105 Corportate Park Drive and Bernards Furniture Group renewing its 298,954 SF at 5644 Hornaday Drive.

The average asking rate declined moderately to $6.57 in Q1. After 19 consecutive quarters of positive rent growth, the increase in available Class B space has dampened growth.

Geotab Fleet Sustainability Data: Expanding ESG Focus Beyond carbon reduction, Geotab made progress across broader ESG priorities.","Geotab recently released its 2024 Sustainability and Impact Report, offering a detailed view of environmental and social progress across global fleet operations. The report draws from data collected from over four million connected vehicles and the company says it aligns with internationally recognized frameworks. These include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), CDP, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Geotab says the report presents some of its most detailed fleet sustainability data to date.

“We believe in the power of connected transportation to help create a better world,” said Neil Cawse, Geotab Founder and CEO. “Through data and insight, we are helping fleets transition to low-carbon alternatives while improving efficiency and safety.”

Measuring Scopes 1, 2, and 3 Emissions

Geotab’s 2023 carbon inventory totaled 1.15 million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent (MTCO₂e). The company says over 99% of that total comes from Scope 3 emissions. Those include supplier activity, product use and employee commuting.

While company growth led to a slight uptick in overall emissions, Scope 2 emissions fell as Geotab expanded renewable electricity use globally. Geotab adds that Scope 1 emissions—related to building fuel and internal fleet operations—remained minimal. The company reaffirmed its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, with targets validated by SBTi.

Tracking Fleet Electrification

The report outlines rapid growth in Geotab’s EV capabilities. The platform now supports over 500,000 electric vehicles—a 70% year-over-year increase. Collectively, those EVs have traveled more than 700 million miles.

Using its EV Suitability Assessment (EVSA) and other tools, Geotab enables fleets to evaluate electric vehicle readiness, measure operational emissions, and benchmark energy efficiency. Real-world Geotab fleet sustainability data confirms the benefits of electrification, with some fleets reporting near-zero tailpipe emissions.

“We’re no longer asking whether EVs can do the job—we’re demonstrating that they are doing the job,” said Megan Allen, Geotab Senior Vice President, Sales & Marketing. “Fleets are seeing results, and that’s creating momentum for adoption.”

As EV models diversify, more fleets are finding electric solutions viable for a broader range of duty cycles, geographies, and vehicle classes.

Regional and Global Progress

The report details how sustainability adoption varies by region:

North America: Renewable electricity sourcing and public-sector collaboration

Europe: Strong policy-driven EV adoption and fuel cost sensitivity

Other regions: Growth through pilots and infrastructure expansion

Geotab also improved its own environmental performance, with 87% of electricity used in international offices coming from renewable sources in 2023.

Benchmarking, Tools, and Real-World Impact

To support customer progress, Geotab says it provides:

Emissions calculators by vehicle type;

Fleet benchmarking dashboards; and

Analytics for decarbonization planning.

Transparency remains central, with third-party reviews supporting the integrity of ESG and emissions data.

According to the report, these real-world examples help reinforce the practical value of these tools:

Geotab recorded a 39% year-over-year increase in sustainability solution deployments.

California Freight cut idling time, saving $50,000 annually—later reinvested in safety upgrades.

Germany’s DB Regio reduced CO₂ emissions by 1,400 tons and saved hundreds of thousands of liters of diesel with smarter fleet operations.

The change was a resounding success; after modifying the recipe, sales of McDonald's milkshakes increased significantly.
This case shows how a small modification in a product can drastically change sales if you understand what consumers are really looking for.","In the world of fast food, marketing strategies play a crucial role in the evolution of products. McDonald's, one of the largest chains in the world, almost suffered a failure with one of its most popular products. Although the brand is known for its innovations, this time, a small change almost ruined the sale of a highly demanded item.

McDonald's Milkshakes have been a product that many customers consume early in the morning. However, recently, the company experienced an unexpected drop in sales of this product. The brand's initial goal was to make the milkshakes healthier, but this shift was not the most suitable.

The Mistake Behind the ""Healthy"" Milkshake

McDonald's milkshake used to be a popular option for those passing through the Drive-Thru at 7 a.m. in the United States. However, the company decided to improve the recipe and make it more nutritious and juicy, which led to a decrease in sales. ""Fewer people were coming to buy those milkshakes,"" mentioned TikToker @eugeoller, who shared the story of this curious brand failure.

To better understand the drop in sales, McDonald's hired an external consultancy that analyzed consumer behavior. The conclusion was surprising: ""People weren't buying those milkshakes for how nutritious they were or just to have a quick breakfast,"" explained the consultancy. The analysis discovered that customers were hiring the milkshake not only for breakfast but as entertainment during their commute to work.

The Solution: Return to Basics and Improve the Experience

The company decided to give a twist to the milkshake recipe to better adapt to what customers really wanted. Instead of making it healthier, they opted to make it thicker, with lumps and cookie pieces.

This extended the consumption experience, turning it into a ""satisfier and entertainment,"" from McDonald's to work, as described by the consultancy. This new formula allowed customers to enjoy a milkshake that lasted longer during their commute.

The change was a resounding success; after modifying the recipe, sales of McDonald's milkshakes increased significantly. ""This hit the nail on the head and made sales of these milkshakes increase dramatically,"" stated TikToker @eugeoller. This case shows how a small modification in a product can drastically change sales if you understand what consumers are really looking for.

This event highlights an important lesson in the world of marketing: understanding the ""job"" a product has to do for the consumer is key to success. McDonald's managed to capture this need and adapted its product to meet it, resulting in an unexpected increase in sales.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/mtonaje-mcdonalds-mujer-emocionada_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-09 11:11:55.401208

Platforms like Vinted or Wallapop have captured a new generation seeking more affordable and sustainable fashion.
H&M, meanwhile, has incorporated new technologies in its stores and launched more sustainable collections, although its future remains uncertain.","The fast fashion industry is experiencing turbulent times. However, few things can challenge the giant Zara and Amancio Ortega. Although sometimes it seems like the competition is going to overtake them, in the end, they manage to withstand any storm.

The same can't be said for H&M, the latest major brand to experience the consequences of a changing market. The Swedish company, which for years was one of Inditex's main competitors, has announced the closure of 28 stores in Spain. As well as the dismissal of 492 workers.

This restructuring reflects the profound impact of digital transformation, the rise of sustainable fashion, and new consumer habits. For years, H&M contested the leadership of fast fashion with giants like Zara. However, the current landscape is very different.

Amancio Ortega Sees His Competition Closing

In the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded a 30% drop in profits, with losses of 258 million euros. The pressure to reduce costs and adapt to a new commercial era has led the company to make decisions. Recent closures in locations like Elche, Orihuela, and Torrevieja are just a sample of the contraction process the brand is undergoing in Spain.

The factors explaining this crisis are multiple. On one hand, e-commerce has gained ground relentlessly, partly driven by the pandemic. Brands like Inditex have managed to adapt better to this reality, with strategies focused on larger and more digitalized stores.

Meanwhile, H&M has reacted more slowly. On the other hand, rising costs, inflation, and fierce competition from brands like Shein and Temu have further eroded its position. Additionally, the rise of the second-hand market has caused a profound change in consumer behavior.

Platforms like Vinted or Wallapop have captured a new generation seeking more affordable and sustainable fashion. All of this is taking customers away from the large traditional chains. But H&M's case is not isolated.

A New Way to Consume Fashion

Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, representing a 30% drop in the number of retail outlets since 2019. Although spending on fashion grew in 2023, this trend has not been enough to stop the disappearance of physical stores. In response to this situation, major brands have accelerated their digitalization.

Inditex has opted for closing small stores to focus on flagship stores and enhance its online channel. H&M, meanwhile, has incorporated new technologies in its stores and launched more sustainable collections, although its future remains uncertain. The market changes, and with it, giants fall.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-primer-plano-amancio-ortega-conversacion-explosion_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-09 13:18:19.713927

TORONTO, April 9, 2025 /CNW/ - New research from the Canadian Association of Financial Institutions in Insurance (CAFII) and Deloitte reveals that artificial intelligence (AI), advanced analytics, and digital-first experiences are poised to transform the Credit Protection Insurance (CPI) industry in Canada. The study, Exploring Emerging Technology & Gen AI Trends in CPI, outlines how insurers are modernizing underwriting, streamlining claims, and meeting rising consumer expectations for digital engagement—while also facing key barriers to adoption.

""This research underscores the need for the insurance industry to modernize and harness new technologies that deliver faster, more accessible, and more tailored protection for Canadian consumers,"" said Keith Martin, Executive Director of CAFII. ""While AI and automation are improving efficiencies, legacy systems and regulatory complexities remain hurdles. The time is now for strategic investments that put consumer experience and digital accessibility at the forefront.""

Key Findings: A Snapshot of the Future of CPI in Canada

AI-Powered Underwriting is Closing Protection Gaps

AI-driven models are reducing approval times, improving risk assessment, and making insurance more inclusive. More than 60% of insurers say AI will have a high impact on underwriting and claims processing over the next 3-5 years.

Consumers Demand Digital-First, Self-Service Insurance

With more than half of CPI insurers prioritizing investments in digital customer engagement, the industry is shifting toward mobile-first experiences, real-time policy access, and digital education tools. 33% of insurers cite enhancing customer experience as a top priority for tech investment, showing a shift toward more consumer-friendly insurance solutions.

Cloud-Based Technology is Driving Agility and Security

Insurers are embracing cloud computing to enhance security compliance, improve operational efficiencies, and integrate AI-driven insights at scale. 70% of insurers identify cloud-based platforms as a key enabler of future-ready CPI services.

Regulatory Barriers & Legacy Systems Are Slowing Adoption

Despite these advancements, outdated infrastructure and fragmented regulatory policies are delaying modernization efforts across the industry. CPI remains heavily reliant on the broader lending ecosystem, creating complexities in technology adoption. Over 70% of insurers cite legacy technology as the biggest challenge in delivering digital-first solutions.

The Path Forward: Building a Future-Ready Insurance Industry

CAFII's research calls for greater collaboration between insurers, fintechs, and regulators to accelerate innovation, investment in AI, and adoption of cloud-based platforms.

By embracing ecosystem partnerships and modernizing digital engagement, Canada's CPI industry has a unique opportunity to lead in financial protection innovation—ensuring Canadians have more seamless, secure, and customized insurance solutions in an evolving financial landscape.

Also on Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders that the levies are likely to ""increase inflation"" on both foreign and domestic goods, and raised concerns over what their impact will be on America's economic alliances.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/04/1280/720/gettyimages-2209004870.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-04-09 13:18:43.004872

The tech has been brought in to do the tedious work of scanning the books of thousands of acclaimed authors to pinpoint any Coke references. From there, WPP has come to a deceptively old-fashioned campaign that majors on a typewriter. A page of monochrome text is reproduced with the words “Coca-Cola” brought to life in a contrasting, colourful red logo.

Islam EIDessouky, global vice president creative strategy and content at Coca-Cola, said: “Coca-Cola’s presence in classic literature is a testament to its enduring cultural impact. This campaign is the embodiment of our Real Magic ethos, celebrating those magical moments in fiction where Coca-Cola is a familiar presence in timeless stories.”

Rafael Pitanguy, deputy global CCO at VML, said: “Coca-Cola has always been more than a beverage – it’s a cultural icon that naturally finds its way into the stories we love. With “Classic” we’re honouring that legacy by bringing its literary presence to life in a way that feels both nostalgic and fresh.”

WPP might have lost Coca-Cola’s media business to Publicis, but creatively it’s looking strong. They have shown a refreshing bravery when it comes to new tech and, as you’d expect, the results are mixed. The global “Masterpiece” campaign was a success, whereas the AI Christmas spot was not (at least it wasn’t with the ad community – customers may well have loved it).

This latest campaign is simple but true. If we go back to the days before we were all worrying about HFSS foods, Coca-Cola does own a place in culture, so why not turn it to their advantage? The books covered include The Shining by Stephen King, Extreme Metaphors by JG Ballard and A House for Mr Biswas by VS Naipaul.

Nostalgic and fresh at the same time. Plus it’s good to see authors as influencers.

“PC shipments experienced a surge in Q1 2025, driven by vendors accelerating deliveries to the US in anticipation of initial tariff announcements,” said Ishan Dutt, Principal Analyst at Canalys, now part of Omdia.
Following several quarters of year-on-year declines, Dell achieved 3% growth, shipping 9.5 million units in Q1.
Asus rounded out the top five rankings with 9% growth and 4.0 million units shipped.
About Canalys Canalys, now part of Omdia, is a leading global technology market analyst firm with a distinct channel focus.","According to the latest data from Canalys, now part of Omdia, total shipments of desktops, notebooks and workstations grew 9.4% to 62.7 million units in Q1 2025. Notebook (including mobile workstations) shipments hit 49.4 million units, up 10% compared to a year ago. Shipments of desktops (including desktop workstations) rose 8% to 13.3 million units. Q1 volumes were boosted by OEMs ramping up shipments to the US in anticipation of the first round of the Trump administration’s tariff announcements. As the next round of higher tariffs on more countries goes into effect, both direct and indirect impacts threaten global PC market recovery and Windows 10 End of Support induced momentum for the remainder of the year.

“PC shipments experienced a surge in Q1 2025, driven by vendors accelerating deliveries to the US in anticipation of initial tariff announcements,” said Ishan Dutt, Principal Analyst at Canalys, now part of Omdia. Lenovo and HP grew shipments to the US in Q1 by around 20% and 13%, respectively. “This preemptive strategy allowed manufacturers and the channel to stock up ahead of potential cost increases, boosting sell-in shipments despite otherwise stable end-user demand,” added Dutt. “Although similar steps are being taken regarding the broader tariffs set to kick in on 9 April 2025, subsequent quarters this year are likely to see a slowdown as inventory levels normalize and customers face higher prices.”

The impact of tariffs on consumer demand is expected to be greater, as purchasing a more expensive PC will need to be prioritized against other spending categories also facing price increases. Businesses, especially SMBs, will also face some pressure that could slow down momentum for the critical transition away from Windows 10 ahead of the October 2025 End-of-Support (EOS) date. “A Canalys (now part of Omdia) March poll of channel partners who are familiar with SMB PC refresh plans revealed that 14% say their customers are not aware of Windows 10 EoS and a further 21% say their customers are aware but have no plans to upgrade,” said Dutt. “For customers in these situations, the delay in planning means they are likely to face a higher cost environment when the time comes to refresh their PC fleets.”

From a production perspective, major OEMs already began supply chain diversification during Trump’s first term and are expected to continue moving away from China towards Vietnam, Thailand, and India, despite these countries also facing the imposition of tariffs. By the end of 2025, most major PC vendors are expected to have completed the shift of US-bound shipments out of China, aiming to enhance supply chain resilience and mitigate the impact of tariffs. For example, in their latest earnings call, HP CEO Enrique Lores stated that 90% of the company’s products sold in the US would be made outside of China by the end of this year. “Although these major manufacturing countries have been targeted with tariffs, their rates remain relatively competitive compared to China’s,” said Ben Yeh, Senior Analyst at Canalys, now part of Omdia. “Moreover, these countries have shown a willingness to negotiate, raising the possibility that the tariffs may eventually be reduced or waived, while China has responded swiftly with a new round of reciprocal tariffs. As a result, production relocation plans are still ongoing and are unlikely to change significantly before further implementation details are announced.”

In Q1 2025, Lenovo maintained its lead in the global PC market, shipping 15.2 million notebooks and desktops and achieving strong growth of 11%. Second-placed HP grew its shipments 6% annually, hitting 12.8 million units. Following several quarters of year-on-year declines, Dell achieved 3% growth, shipping 9.5 million units in Q1. Apple secured fourth place with strong shipment growth of 22%, shipping 6.5 million units and capturing 10.4% market share. Asus rounded out the top five rankings with 9% growth and 4.0 million units shipped.

Applying this same test, the court held that the defendants’ DVD replication processes used the patented technology and that outsourcing production did not absolve the defendants of liability.

The three interconnected suits concerned the infringement of Philips’ patent 218255, which was crucial to EFM+ coding in DVD systems and integral to the standardisation of DVD production.

Case background

Pearl Engineering – owned by Sukesh Behl – had obtained a licence from Philips in 2005 but later claimed that it was signed under duress. Despite repeated notices, Pearl defaulted on its obligations between 2005 and 2010 by failing to submit sales reports and pay royalties. Philips terminated the licence in 2010, but Pearl continued to manufacture DVDs and thus infringed Philips’ rights. Other defendants were also found to have similarly defaulted.

The defendants argued that there was no infringement, since the EFM+ encoding was outsourced to third parties. They also filed counterclaims challenging the patent’s validity, claiming:

non-disclosure of counterpart foreign applications under Section 8 of the Patents Act;

lack of novelty due to prior art;

non-patentability of the subject matter under Section 3; and

insufficiency in disclosure.

They contended that Philips delayed filing the suit until 2012 despite having been aware of the infringement since 2005.

The Delhi High Court’s decision

The court found no deliberate suppression under Section 8 and attributed errors to the prosecuting agent. It held that the patent was valid, rejecting the defendants’ prior art and patentability arguments. The court further ruled that the defendants had failed to prove that the patent was not essential to DVD technology, affirming its status as an SEP.

In evaluating infringement, patent claims 1 to 11 were found to pertain to a method of modulation, coding or compression (namely, EFM+ coding), while claim 12 covered the tangible storage medium holding such modulated signals. Therefore, any storage medium containing signals encoded via EFM+ would infringe the SEP. To assess whether the defendants’ replication process did in fact use the patented technology, the court referred to the division bench’s judgment in Intex Technologies v Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, which discussed the test of indirect infringement (2023). Applying this same test, the court held that the defendants’ DVD replication processes used the patented technology and that outsourcing production did not absolve the defendants of liability.

Calculation of damages

Although Philips’ patent lapsed in 2015 – rendering an injunction moot – the court proceeded to assess damages. It considered:

the nature of the invention;

Philips’ standard royalty rates;

the scale and duration of infringement;

the defendants’ unwillingness to negotiate; and

the financial impact on Philips.

As established by the UK Supreme Court in Unwired Planet (2020) and the Delhi High Court in Xiaomi v Ericsson (2014), the court concluded that FRAND rates serve as the most appropriate basis for calculating damages in SEP infringement cases.

Damages were thus calculated based on Philips’ standard royalty rate for the suit patent, which was US$0.03 per unit. Philips’ evidence supported this rate. The court also found the defendants to be unwilling licensees that were acting in bad faith. Their prolonged infringement prompted the court to award interest at 12% per annum on the total damages calculated from the suit’s filing date until payment, along with aggravated damages.

The court thus issued the following instructions:

Pearl Engineering and Sukesh Behl to pay US$750,000 + 12% interest.

Siddharth Optical to pay US$195,000 + 12% interest.

Powercube Infotech to pay US$1.5 million + 12% interest.

In addition, all three parties were liable to pay aggravated damages of US$115,804. The court also granted full litigation costs to Philips, acknowledging its ordeal due to the defendants’ delaying tactics and the extension of the litigation until the patent had lapsed.

Though the delay in adjudication has attracted criticism (the litigation having outlived both the patent and the DVD industry), this judgment is detailed and well reasoned. It aligns with recent SEP decisions from Indian courts and serves as a cautionary tale for unwilling licensees.",https://d2qu5xmcgmzxnb.cloudfront.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,N,,2025-04-09 12:23:00.250977

The San Francisco-based company said its guidance for the financial year 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors.

Levi sees organic revenue growth, which excludes items such as currency impact and divestments, growing 3.5% to 4.5% this year. Shares rose 2.3% in extended New York trading.

Since US President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on April 2, the stock declined 19%.

Chief financial officer Harmit Singh said in an interview it’s “difficult to forecast or plan at this stage” for the tariffs’ impact on consumers. The company created a group to analyse the tariffs while it focuses on issues it can control such as its relationships with vendors and the cost base for its products.

Chief executive officer Michelle Gass said the company is approaching the topic of tariffs with “urgency, but not being overly reactive”.

Levi is one of the first retailers to report earnings after Trump unveiled the tariffs last week. The announcement has roiled world markets, hitting apparel companies especially hard.

The company said it sources about 5% of its goods in the United States from Mexico, a mid-single digit from Vietnam and 1% from China.

It works with 130 facilities in China, 50 in Vietnam, 37 in Bangladesh and 36 in Sri Lanka, according to a company website listing partners in its supply chain. Gass said Levi sources from 28 countries.

“We’re doing our homework,” she added, without offering specifics on the measures the company is taking to counteract the tariffs.

If the company needs to raise prices it would be “surgical”, Gass said, and focused on new products that have resonated with shoppers.

Consumers are gravitating towards more premium products, Gass added during the company’s call with analysts on Monday. — Bloomberg",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/04/09/3255386.jpeg,N,,2025-04-09 14:11:34.738295

For the event, Starbucks has also introduced its latest “R&D team member”, Xionglinger (熊灵儿), a bear mascot that doesn’t look much like a “Bearista” but more like Disney’s LinaBell.

Starbucks has been heavy on activations in China this year. From its Snoopy and Lululemon collaborations to its “partner”-centric ESG campaign, the American chain is eager to appeal to Chinese coffee lovers in the face of fierce local competition from Luckin and Cotti Coffee.

Investors are pleased with the EPS beat and reaffirmation of guidance, especially following recent guidance reductions.","Levi Strauss (LEVI, Financial) initially saw gains after reporting a substantial EPS beat for Q1, despite in-line revenues. While Q2 guidance showed higher revenue expectations, EPS was slightly below forecasts. Importantly, LEVI reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which has significantly boosted investor confidence. Last quarter, LEVI had lowered its FY25 guidance, so maintaining it amid tariff and macroeconomic challenges is a positive surprise.

LEVI has reclassified its Dockers segment as discontinued operations while exploring a sale. This reclassification complicates comparisons to consensus estimates. However, LEVI surpassed expectations in sales, margins, and EPS, driven by its strategic momentum. A notable growth factor has been the popularity of loose and baggy fits, now comprising about 15% of its bottoms portfolio.

The company is making strides in becoming a Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) brand, with DTC sales growing 12% organically, driven by client growth, new openings, and e-commerce performance. In Q1, DTC accounted for 52% of global sales. LEVI sees significant growth potential in e-commerce, currently at 12% of revenues. The Wholesale business also grew 5% organically, with strong US performance.

Historically known for men's jeans, LEVI has expanded its offerings, particularly for women, with the women's segment growing double digits over the past two quarters and now representing 38% of revenues. The recent women's Cinch Baggy launch went viral on TikTok, boosting sales.

Regarding tariffs, LEVI is still assessing potential impacts, given the recent announcements. The company is planning mitigation strategies, though its full-year outlook remains unchanged, with minimal anticipated Q2 margin impact as most spring and early summer products are already in the US.

LEVI has made progress in reducing expenses, aiding margins and providing resilience against tariff pressures. It sources from 28 countries, with 20 supplying to the US. LEVI believes it has pricing power, with nearly 60% of revenue generated outside the US.

Overall, this was a strong quarter for LEVI. Investors are pleased with the EPS beat and reaffirmation of guidance, especially following recent guidance reductions. However, the newly announced tariffs remain a variable, with potential impacts to be evaluated as the year progresses.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C000026W9.png?20,N,,2025-04-09 12:22:19.463079

The US Federal Reserve has signalled a potential pause in interest rate hikes, which could stabilize fixed-income yields and benefit life insurers’ investment portfolios.
On the positive side, increased awareness of climate and cyber risks are expected to drive further growth in specialty insurance lines.”","PICC Property and Casualty and Assicurazioni Generali shares surge 40%

Elevance Health and Cigna Group lose over 15%

Berkshire Hathaway retains top spot

The aggregate market capitalization (MCap) of the top 25 global insurers grew 17% to $3.5 trillion year-on-year (YoY) during the first quarter (Q1) ended on 31 March 2025. Most of the stocks recorded a sharp growth in Q1, benefiting from the higher premium pricing amid inflationary trends, improved investment income driven by elevated interest rates, and favorable underwriting performance due to fewer large-scale catastrophic events in the period, according to GlobalData, a leading data analytics and research company.

Murthy Grandhi, Company Profiles Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The global insurance industry showed signs of recovery in early 2024, with property and casualty insurers implementing premium increases to counter inflation and rising natural disaster claims, while life insurers continued adapting to shifting interest rate environments. The sector accelerated digital transformation efforts through AI and automation investments, expanded parametric insurance offerings for climate risks, and focused on customer experience improvements.”

PICC Property and Casualty

PICC P&C, the largest non-life insurance company in mainland China, shares registered a remarkable 40.5% growth in market value during the period, driven by strong FY2024 results on the back of strategic optimization of its motor vehicle insurance business structure with 38.8% market share in household motor vehicle insurance, coupled with accelerated growth in non-motor vehicle insurance segments and enhanced operational efficiency through technology-enabled expense management.

Assicurazioni Generali

Generali’s excellent 2024 results exceeded financial targets and completed the “Lifetime Partner 24” strategic plan through consistent organic growth and successful business integrations, positioning the company to pursue its new “Lifetime Partner 27” plan focusing on earnings growth, cash generation, and increased shareholder returns while leveraging AI capabilities to address evolving customer needs. Consequently, the company’s market valuation also rose by 39.5%, reaching $55.1 billion by the end of Q1 2025.

Grandhi continues: “Berkshire Hathaway witnessed a 25.7% increase in market value attributed to its strong investment portfolio performance, particularly in energy and infrastructure assets, and resilient insurance underwriting results across GEICO and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Furthermore, strategic investment decisions by Warren Buffett, and investor confidence in the company’s substantial cash reserves perpetuated the stock’s upward trajectory, affirming Berkshire Hathaway’s status as a coveted asset.”

Elevance Health and The Cigna Group saw sharp YoY declines of -18.6% and -17.0%, respectively. This downturn was largely influenced by declining enrolment in individual and group health plans, elevated medical loss ratios, and ongoing antitrust scrutiny affecting sentiment. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) also fell 15.4% due to underwhelming policy growth, weak equity market returns in India and limited foreign institutional investment.

Grandhi concludes: “Looking ahead to Q2 2025, the global insurance industry faces a nuanced outlook. The US Federal Reserve has signalled a potential pause in interest rate hikes, which could stabilize fixed-income yields and benefit life insurers’ investment portfolios. However, geopolitical developments—such as recent tariff escalations between the US and China—may pressure global trade insurance demand and raise claims risk, particularly in marine and credit insurance lines.

“Moreover, inflationary pressures in Europe and selective tightening in Asian economies could compress margins, though they also prompt upward repricing, supporting premium growth. On the positive side, increased awareness of climate and cyber risks are expected to drive further growth in specialty insurance lines.”",https://www.globaldata.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PR20536.png,N,,2025-04-09 10:06:50.137248

“The market is clearly showing some level of pull-in in the first quarter this year as both vendors and end-users brace for the impact of US tariffs. In a first quarter still relatively untouched by tariffs, the entire ecosystem attempted to accelerate the pace of deliveries to avoid the first round of US tariffs and expected volatility for the remainder of the year,” says Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.

“Evidently, commercial demand remained strong in the first quarter, but the new round of US tariffs announced on April 2nd could have a direct inflationary impact on the PC market that could result in delayed IT spending for the remainder of the year.”

Most of the underlying demand factors for PCs, such as the installed base upgrade ahead of Windows 10 end of support, and demand for on-device AI, remain strong, as illustrated by the volumes shipped in Q1 2025.

Trump's latest trade measures, which came into force as of 5 a.m. London time, include a 20% tariff on the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan and a 49% levy on Cambodia.

China responded to Trump's tariff policies by hiking its levies on U.S. imports to 84%, with the duties set to take effect from April 10.

Shares of French car parts supplier Valeo traded down 7.1% on Wednesday, tumbling toward the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.

Germany's Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW fell around 2%, with the latter notching a fresh 52-week low.

In Asia, Japan's Nissan and Toyota fell 7% and 2.6%, respectively.

Trump's ""reciprocal"" trade measures will be applied separately and not on top of existing U.S. auto tariffs, according to S&P Global.

The U.S. implemented a 25% charge on all foreign cars imported into the country last Thursday. The White House said it also intends to place tariffs on some auto parts no later than May 3.

Analysts warn that German car manufacturers are likely to be the most exposed to the U.S. trade measures.

""The tariffs are a blow for especially the German car makers which export hundreds of thousands of units to the US annually (749,000 in 2024) and produce many cars in the US itself which require European parts,"" Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC in emailed comments.

""It's hard to work around the tariffs, and they seem to stay at least a while, so they need to deal with it and will have to reconsider product offerings, pricing and manufacturing footprints,"" he added.

An escalating trade war is expected to have a profound impact on the global car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.

Arkansas lawmakers advance bill that could potentially eliminate CVS in the Natural State

Tuesday, lawmakers in Arkansas advanced a bill that would essentially eliminate a popular pharmacy chain in the Natural State. The Arkansas Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee heard House Bill 1150 in Little Rock on Tuesday. The bill's sponsors say it aims to prohibit a pharmacy benefits manager, also known as a PBM, from obtaining certain pharmacy permits. CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefits manager, owned by CVS Health, which owns and operates CVS Pharmacies. ""I want to be clear,"" Rep. Jeremiah Moore said. ""House Bill 1150 does not force pharmacy closures. It forces companies that are a PBM to either choose between being a pharmacy and a drug provider or choosing to be a pharmacy benefits manager."" Sponsors say the bill simply prevents a company from being both a provider and a benefits manager. Supporters also say it would make prescriptions less expensive. After hearing from both sides, the Senate Insurance and Commerce Committee passed the bill. ""And I fully expect that we'll be put our best foot forward in the Senate tomorrow and Lord willing, we'll pass House Bill 150 and the governor will sign it,"" Moore said. CVS Health is pushing back against the bill and sent a statement to 40/29 News. ""House Bill 1150 would cripple pharmacy care access and affordability in Arkansas. It endangers Arkansans by eliminating access to vital community pharmacies, eroding patient safety, and making prescription drugs more expensive. It will cost hundreds of jobs and raise health care costs by millions of dollars per year. A vote for HB 1150 is a vote to create health care chaos for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities.""A CVS staffer spoke to state lawmakers on Tuesday. ""We're deeply embedded in the fabric of the communities we serve,"" district leader for CVS Pharmacy Ashley Ellis said. ""Providing care and guidance to 340,000 Arkansans who rely on us every year. This bill doesn't just threaten our livelihoods, it threatens the health and well-being of our patients.""The bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, if it receives the full support of state lawmakers. Supporters say that would allow enough time for arrangements to be made between providers and patients.

ID19,H&M,2025-04-09 08:51:11+00:00,newwavemagazine,"As H&M bets on AI, we speak with one of the photographer's they're trying to replace",Henry Tuppen,,,,,https://www.newwavemagazine.com/single-post/as-h-m-bets-on-ai-we-speak-with-one-of-the-photographer-s-they-re-trying-to-replace,"We talked about how she got her start, what keeps her going, and where she sees fashion photography heading.
RS: Fashion photography is all about expressing a creative vision through the clothes and the style.
RS: It’s definitely interesting.
RS: It’s all about networking, social media, and word of mouth.
RS: It’s fast-paced and competitive, but if you love creativity and learning, it’s a great field to be in.","Fashion, at its core, is a group project. Strip away the gloss of runways and retail, and what you’re left with is a living, breathing ecosystem powered by people - stylists, producers, photographers, set designers, assistants - each adding something to the final frame. The longer I’ve spent in this industry, the more I’ve realised that it’s the collaborations, not the clothes, that stay with you.

During our AW25 coverage at New Wave, we were pulling together a team for Paris Fashion Week - (fast-paced, overwhelming, but always worth it), and I reached out to Raphaele Sohier, a photographer whose work I’d been following for a while. There’s a rawness to her images that feels rare in the algorithm-optimised landscape of runway photography. She has a way of injecting intimacy and edge into something that can often be so formulaic.

The week came and went in a blur, as fashion weeks tend to do, but Raphaele’s work stuck with me. Her eye brought personality, warmth, a human pulse; vital to our coverage. It was the first time we worked together, and it wasn't the last.

As we all try to make sense of AI-generated models and the slow, creeping automation of creative work (H&M’s recent announcement comes to mind), I’ve been thinking a lot about the value of human connection in fashion. The best part of this job isn’t the front-row seat - it’s building something real with other people.

So I sat down with Raphaele to get a closer look at her world. We talked about how she got her start, what keeps her going, and where she sees fashion photography heading. If you’re curious about the gears turning behind the camera, this conversation is a good place to start…

NW: How did you get into photography?

RS: I started messing around with a camera when I was younger because my dad had one. I didn’t think much of it, but I loved having it with me. When I hit high school, I started charging a little bit for photos, but basketball and school were my main focus back then, so photography was more of a hobby for a while.

NW: Who/what are your main inspirations for your work?

RS: There are a few photographers I really admire, like Elizabeta Parodina with her crazy use of colour, Aidan Zamiri, and Gabriel Moses. But I also get a lot of inspiration from everyday life - the little moments you catch in the world around you that make you think.

NW: How long have you been a photographer?

RS: I’ve been doing it professionally for over two years, but it’s been a part of my life for much longer. Photography is what really fills the creative space for me, and I can see myself doing this for the long haul.

NW: What makes shooting for fashion different to other photography work?

RS: Fashion photography is all about expressing a creative vision through the clothes and the style. It’s not just about snapping a moment - it’s about conveying a feeling or idea. For me, the artistic side is key: lighting, composition, and how the model and setting come together. It's more about telling a story than just selling something.

NW: How do you feel about the recent announcement that H&M will be starting to use AI models? How do you think this will affect photographers?

RS: It’s definitely interesting. It is going to change things, but I don’t think AI will ever replace real human creativity in photography. People will still want to work with other people. It’s a little scary to see how fast things are evolving, but I think there will always be a place for the human touch in the creative process. There might be a shift, but I’m hopeful things will balance out.

NW: Are there any particular campaigns you are especially proud of?

RS: One that stands out for me was working with Vogue Arabia. That was a huge moment and really pushed me to aim higher. Also, working on a project with a Montreal-based team was special - it felt like a real collaboration.

NW: Do you have any tips for people trying to get into the industry?

RS: Just stay true to yourself. It’s about pushing yourself to get better, not just in your work but in life too. You have to be in the right mental space to create something that truly resonates with people.

NW: What are the hardest parts about working in the industry?

RS: Staying consistent is tough, and there’s this feeling of never fully being satisfied with your work. You’re always moving to the next thing, and sometimes you forget to appreciate what you’ve already achieved. That can definitely lead to burnout, and I think a lot of artists feel that.

NW: And what are the best parts?

RS: The best part is definitely working with other creatives who have the same passion and mindset as you. There’s something really inspiring about collaborating with like-minded people.

NW: What is the process of shooting like?

RS: It all starts with the concept - whether it’s something the client wants or an idea I’ve created. Then I gather the team - stylist, makeup artist, models - and we all get on the same page. On the day, it’s about setting up lighting, adjusting the camera, and making sure we get the right shot. People don’t realise how important lighting is in photography.

I remember starting out with a flashlight as my main light source, and while it worked, my current style needs lighting pushed to another level. My favourite part is definitely post-production though - that’s where I really get to bring everything together, refining the images, tweaking colours, and just experimenting. It’s a lot of trial and error, but I love that process.

NW: What other work goes into setting up a shoot?

RS: A lot of prep goes into it. You need to scout locations, figure out logistics, and talk through everything with the team. Organizing outfits with the creative director is key to making sure it all flows. Creative direction is also super important - it’s about making sure everything, from makeup to styling, works together as part of a bigger story.

NW: What does your average day look like when you’re on a shoot and when you are not but still working?

RS: On shoot days, I’m up early, going over the creative direction, and sketching out lighting ideas. Lighting can really change depending on skin tones, clothing, and the backdrop, so I do a lot of prep before we start. When I’m not shooting, I’m editing photos, sending emails, updating my portfolio, and keeping up with admin stuff. But I also try to take time to rest. If I don’t, I notice it affects my creativity. I love making mood boards and finding new sources of inspiration, too. Pinterest is great, but I’m exploring other platforms now to expand my ideas.

NW: Are there other roles that you can do to help you get into a career in photography?

RS: Definitely. Assisting photographers is a great way to learn and see how the pros work. Production roles are also a good way to understand what goes into a shoot. I actually worked in experiential production before jumping into photography again. That’s where I met my mentor, who was the photographer for a shoot we produced. He really helped me understand gear, what’s worth investing in, and shared a ton of valuable knowledge.

NW: What would you be doing if you weren’t a photographer?

RS: I’d probably be in something related to health. Kinesiology has always interested me - I even started a certificate in it. I think it comes from my time playing basketball when I was younger, always getting injured and spending time with my kinesiologist. I really admired their work.

RS: It’s all about networking, social media, and word of mouth. I reach out to potential clients, pitch my ideas, and collaborate with other creatives. In the beginning, you have to hustle to get your foot in the door, but eventually, it leads to working with your dream clients.

RS: It’s fast-paced and competitive, but if you love creativity and learning, it’s a great field to be in. The industry is always changing, so you have to be adaptable. Keep pushing and growing, and there’s always room for more.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/87e592_dab37f0fd0f84afbbfaf09be00b0eb02~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_813,h_1000,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/87e592_dab37f0fd0f84afbbfaf09be00b0eb02~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-04-09 07:00:03.638676

Gass took over the helm in 2024 as the struggling retailer announced a multiyear global productivity initiative to turn around the business and boost profitability.
However, Gass said the company’s supply chain “is more agile today than it ever has been” and that it “pivots” all the time.
“We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term,” Gass said.
Business executives have warned of the potential impact tariffs could have on the U.S. economy.","Levi Strauss & Co. CEO Michelle Gass said that any price hikes the company makes due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs would be “surgical.”

Gass, on an earnings call Monday, told analysts that the situation around tariffs is “very new” and “fluid” and that the company is just “getting our arms around it.”

She stopped short of specifying what those price increases would look like, saying “as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it will be very surgical,” Gass said during the call.

Gass took over the helm in 2024 as the struggling retailer announced a multiyear global productivity initiative to turn around the business and boost profitability.

Under the initiative, called Project Fuel, the retailer plans to optimize its operating model and structure, redesign business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs while simplifying processes across the organization. It has since laid off dozens of workers out of its California office, and warned that more could come.

With tariffs adding to its woes, Gass told analysts Monday that the company has assembled a task force to assess “the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate,” which could include “structural changes.”

The company sources from 28 countries, 20 of which are imported into the U.S. However, Gass said the company’s supply chain “is more agile today than it ever has been” and that it “pivots” all the time.

“We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term,” Gass said.

Business executives have warned of the potential impact tariffs could have on the U.S. economy.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Monday that the stock market could see declines deepen due to uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession.

Also on Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders that the levies are likely to “increase inflation” on both foreign and domestic goods, and raised concerns over what their impact will be on America’s economic alliances.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-cbbak7fti-1744165113575.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744150729&w=1024,N,,2025-04-09 13:18:48.296130

Marcella joins from Johnson & Johnson Innovation and is an accomplished leader with extensive experience in immuno-oncology, precision medicine, and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs).

The financing will enable the completion of a Phase 1B clinical trial of its lead tumour antigen-coated oncolytic virus candidate, PeptiCRAd-1, in Germany, Italy, and Australia.

At Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Marcella was responsible for sourcing and advancing external innovation opportunities across oncology, immunology, rare diseases, and ATMPs. Her role included identifying new assets, engaging in external partnerships, and policy development to drive innovation in life sciences.

Prior to J&J Innovation, Marcella held key roles at Janssen’s Immunology Medical Affairs Department, where she supported the medical engagement, clinical feasibility, and launch strategies for therapies such as ustekinumab, guselkumab, golimumab, and sirukumab.

This tale of two steel plants in undivided Visakhapatnam district has become a topic of heated discussion in the two Telugu States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
The steel plant's first phase is proposed with an investment of Rs55,964 crore to produce 7.3 million tonnes by January, 2029.
The second phase is envisaged with Rs80,000 crore to produce 20.5 million tonnes by 2033.
When RINL faced fund crunch, the Visakhapatnam Port Authority (then known as Visakhapatnam Port Trust) had come forward to develop it as a satellite port by entering into a joint venture with RINL and the State Government.","Visakhapatnam: It's a tale of two major steel plants with contrasting stories. While one is battling for a hand-to-mouth existence, another, yet to be grounded, is being showered a slew of favours even though it is at a conceptual stage.

This tale of two steel plants in undivided Visakhapatnam district has become a topic of heated discussion in the two Telugu States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, is a result of a prolonged people's movement under the 'Visakha Ukku Andhrula Hakku' banner claiming the lives of 32 people in police firing in November, 1966. It does not have captive mines gaining the reputation as the only major steel manufacturer in India without owning iron ore and coal mines and coughing up a heavy amount towards sourcing the raw material.

Another steel plant, proposed with a production capacity of 17.8 million tonnes in two phases with an investment of Rs1.35 lakh crore by ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AMNS) India at Rajayyapeta in Anakapalli district, about 70 km from here, has been granted permission as well as land at the same place to develop and own a captive port at a recent meeting of State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

The captive port's first phase is envisaged with 20.5 million tonnes and an investment of Rs5,816 crore. The steel plant's first phase is proposed with an investment of Rs55,964 crore to produce 7.3 million tonnes by January, 2029. The second phase is envisaged with Rs80,000 crore to produce 20.5 million tonnes by 2033. Incidentally, the site allotted to AMNS was earlier sanctioned for a captive port by Anrak Aluminium Limited (AAL), which set up a refinery near Makavarapalem but could not get clearance for mining of bauxite mines in the tribal areas due to opposition over violation of Samata Judgement given by Supreme Court on July 11, 1997 in the Samta Vs State of Andhra Pradesh and others. The Samata Judgement pertains to rights of tribals over the minerals in the scheduled areas as per the Regulation 1/70 of Land Transfer (Prohibition) Act.

Ironically, RINL popularly known as Vizag Steel, had plans to develop a captive port at Gangavaram on its own land to handle raw material imports and exports and save an estimated Rs1,000 crore per annum towards logistics. When RINL faced fund crunch, the Visakhapatnam Port Authority (then known as Visakhapatnam Port Trust) had come forward to develop it as a satellite port by entering into a joint venture with RINL and the State Government.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/04/09/1960838-steel.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 04:04:20.909198

The company plans to close its Ochsenfurt milk production facility in the fourth quarter of 2026.

Management stated that this decision – made despite recognising the dedication of the employees and the long tradition of the factory – is deemed necessary, to ensure long-term competitiveness in the German-speaking region.

The production will be reinforced at the Fulda site, under its ‘Renew Danone’ initiative, wherein significant investment is planned, the company added.

Operational Challenges

The decision to close the Ochsenfurt facility follows several operational challenges.

Production volumes at the facility have not grown as expected, with current utilisation at only half the level recorded in 2019.

Changes in consumer behaviour and production costs considerably above the average of other Danone plants in Europe have further impacted the site’s economic viability.

Danone believes that these factors necessitate the closure of the plant, to offset persistent unprofitability, resulting from low utilisation and high costs.

The Fulda site, employing nearly 600 staff members and specialising in products such as infant formula and medical nutrition, will be the focus of future investment and strategy, the company added.

Support Measures

The management has committed to minimising the impact on employees and the local community.

Richard Trechman, managing director of Danone DACH, stated, “In recent years, we have grown in the German-speaking region in an extremely challenging environment and are strongly positioned for the future. I am very proud of what we have achieved as a team.”

Trechman further noted that, although the decision is regrettable, efforts will be made to reassign as many affected employees as possible to positions at the Fulda site.

Danone will introduce specific retraining and upskilling programmes and collaborate with the regional Federal Employment Agency and local companies to facilitate the transition of personnel.

For employees who cannot be re-employed within the organisation, Danone plans to negotiate a fair social plan with the Works Council, taking measures such as early retirement and pension-bridging into consideration.

Additionally, the company announced that it will engage with political stakeholders and regional partners to ensure that the closure does not have significant adverse effects on Ochsenfurt and its surrounding region.",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA1XFxcLzEwMTQwOTE1XFxcL0Rhbm9uZV83MTAwODI2Ml9tLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC9pbWcucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiN2U3MDRlOTk3ZDg5N2RiMGFlMjczZTY0ZWMxYzZhNGQ2ZWE1MjM3MiJ9/danone-restructures-production-in-germany-with-planned-closure-of-milk-factory.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 08:03:35.974032

HB1150 would prevent PBMs from owning pharmacies. PBMs, like CVS Health, serve as the middlemen that negotiate drug prices from companies and pharmacies.

Ashley Ellis, a district leader for CVS Health, a PBM that also operates pharmacies, said she would lose her job if the bill passes, closing 23 CVS pharmacies.

“We stand for not only our jobs, but also for the patient access and affordability for their prescriptions,” Ellis said.

John Vinson with the Arkansas Pharmacists’ Association said the bill creates a more competitive market.

While he is sympathetic to the situation, he said 65 local pharmacies have already been closing because of a loss of profit due to PBM price-setting.

“We have also had many members, hundreds of members, lose jobs over the last 10 years,” Vinson said. “The Federal Trade Commission had information that 10% of the independent pharmacies in the country have closed by these anti-competitive acts by PBMs.”

Vinson said PBMs can’t be both the price setter and the price taker.

Lucille Accetta with CVS Health believes there is a fair open market for patients to choose which pharmacies they want to use.

“All pharmacies that are in the network, that they ascribe to the PBMs, they receive higher compensation in their fee structure, so it’s open to any patient to go to any pharmacy,” Acetta said. “There is no steerage to go to our pharmacies.”

The bill’s language doesn’t force PBMs out of Arkansas, but it does force them to choose between being a PBM or being a pharmacy.

“This bill being signed into law would take away my job and the jobs of hundreds of people across Arkansas, it’s going to take away access to care,” Ellis said.

“We really, really appreciate all of our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians and the care they deliver, and we’re confident with a competitive market, currently the market is anti-competitive, but with the passage of this bill to improve competition, we think it’s pro-business, pro-competition and pro-patient,” Vinson said.

People against this bill say it’s going to decrease access to pharmacies, however, Vinson said there is other legislation to expand access.

The bill is now heading to the full Senate after passing in a Senate committee.",https://www.kark.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2025/04/snapshot-52.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-04-09 10:06:28.313635

This can be accomplished by speaking in terms of business risk, not just technical vulnerabilities.
What trends are you watching most closely when it comes to the future of cyber risk at the business level?","In this Help Net Security interview, Kevin Serafin, CISO at Ecolab, discusses aligning security strategy with long-term business goals, building strong partnerships across the organization, and approaching third-party risk with agility.

How do you define cyber risk within your organization’s overall enterprise risk framework?

At Ecolab, we don’t approach cyber risk in isolation. Instead, it’s positioned as an integral component of our overall enterprise risk management framework. We define cyber risk as the potential for loss or harm related to technical infrastructure, use of technology, or management of information and, generally, we evaluate risk in a few different ways.

First, we look at operational risks which includes risks that could disrupt our ability to deliver products or services including system outages, data corruption, or impact to critical infrastructure that could affect business continuity. Second, we look at financial risks which include potential monetary losses from cyber incidents such as fraud, regulatory fines, remediation costs, or revenue impacts from service disruptions. The final prong in our framework is reputational risk.

We view these are risks that that might be more difficult to quantify but could ultimately have an outsized impact such as an incident that erodes customer trust, devalues our brand, and could even create longer-term market disadvantages.

How do you ensure cybersecurity strategy aligns with your organization’s core mission and long-term business goals?

Around the world, everything we do is rooted in our more than 100-year history helping customers drive growth through operational efficiencies while conserving natural resources. It’s our north star and core to who we are. By ensuring our cybersecurity strategy is aligned with our mission helps us deliver on key business goals – both within our own organization and for our customers. It’s foundational to delivering a successful cybersecurity program.

As Ecolab’s CISO, I chair a steering committee that regularly convenes a cross-functional group of executives including our Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), General Counsel and key business leaders. Together, we discuss how our cyber initiatives can most effectively support the company’s strategic business objectives.

We’ve been sure to position the security team as consultative partners, rather than gatekeepers. We’re at the table to help find solutions not stifle new ideas. When new business initiatives are proposed, we participate from inception, collaborating on solutions that meet business needs while managing the risk appropriately.

This partnership mentality has transformed the conversations from “Can we do this securely?” to “How can we do this securely?”. The difference is subtle but important – it positions security as an enabler of innovation rather than a barrier.

How do you strike the right balance between enforcing security standards and enabling business agility with third parties?

To get this balance right, we’ve evolved from a binary “approved/denied” mentality to a more nuanced risk-based framework that considers both security requirements as well as business value. We’ve implemented a tiered assessment program that scales the assessment according to risk exposure. Critical suppliers handling sensitive data or business process undergo comprehensive assessments, while lower-risk providers may encounter a more streamlined review. This prevents unnecessary friction for business-critical relationships while allowing us to focus on reducing risk to the organization. We have also standardized our security requirements across our suppliers to create clear expectations that suppliers understand from the start.

For strategic partnerships, we’ve adopted a continuous monitoring approach rather than point-in-time assessments. This real-time visibility allows us to quickly reassess changes in a supplier’s risk profile and react accordingly. To do this we blend our own internal monitoring with various cyber risk intelligence services to provide that dynamic view of our supplier cybersecurity posture.

What has been your biggest takeaway about embedding cybersecurity into enterprise strategy?

As cybersecurity professionals, we can help shift some of the more challenging legacy perceptions of the function. It requires demonstrating how cybersecurity is more than a cost center – instead, it’s a driver of tangible business value.

Moving beyond compliance driven security to risk informed business enablement. This can be accomplished by speaking in terms of business risk, not just technical vulnerabilities. When security is positioned as an accelerator of digital transformation rather than a roadblock, it gains the strategic importance and resource support needed for optimized effectiveness. That doesn’t happen overnight, it requires intentional change management and consistent demonstration of how security investments directly support business objectives, protect revenue, maintain customer trust and create competitive differentiation.

What trends are you watching most closely when it comes to the future of cyber risk at the business level?

The global regulatory landscape continues to change rapidly. It’s something we’ve adapted to by tracking much more consistency and it’s sure to remain top of mind. This highly fluid external environment demands a shift towards continuous monitoring and a much more comprehensive compliance management program. We must be ready to adapt quickly as new laws come into play as well as ensuring our suppliers are compliant where relevant.",https://img.helpnetsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/08092511/kevin_serafin-2-ecolab.webp,N,,2025-04-09 04:05:08.252996

Those who have been scouring shelves for deep discounts have been underwhelmed, according to social media.

But that’s about to change for those in the Toronto area, as the company has revealed plans to offer deeply discounted goods at its warehouse in northern Etobicoke — at 160 Carrier Dr. — starting Thursday.

There are thousands of deals to ready to be shopped, a spokesperson told The Toronto Sun in a statement, adding bargain hunters can expect “heavily reduced” prices on furniture, mattresses, kitchen essentials and home decor, apparel, handbags, kids’ toys and other items.

The discounts are said to be up to 60% off top brand-name items. There will even be select HBC stripes items up for grabs, though selection is limited.

The warehouse will be open for business on Thursdays to Sundays until everything is sold (with the exception of April 18-20).

All products are sold as is, the company noted, and no cash — only credit and debit cards — will be accepted.

Last month, Canada’s oldest retailer announced that all but six of its locations in Canada will remain open after filing for creditor protection.

However, the financially troubled company’s restructuring proposal was rejected by an Ontario court, increasing the likelihood that lenders may seek to push the company into receivership.

Retail experts say HBC’s looming demise as a national presence would be a “historic loss” but not surprising, given the retailer’s inability to draw customers into stores.

That said, the billionaire owner of three B.C. shopping malls has declared her intent to purchase the ailing Hudson’s Bay department store chain, outlining her plan in a series of videos posted on a Chinese social network, the Vancouver Sun‘s Michael John Lo reported.

The stakes were raised even higher in the lead up, as retaliatory sparring between Beijing and the US prompted Trump to ratchet China’s tariffs up to a staggering 104 per cent. While the administration appears open to negotiations, no country has successfully bartered their tariffs down to zero yet, and reciprocal tariffs from China and the EU were set to go into effect as of Tuesday.

The situation is volatile, with questions remaining right up until midnight. How long they’ll last is unclear; that uncertainty has thrown global stock markets into disarray. After a brief rally on Tuesday morning on the notion of negotiations, the S&P 500, the Dow and Nasdaq all shed earlier gains, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.7 per cent, the Dow tumbling 300 points and Nasdaq falling 2.4 per cent as of market close.

New US tariffs throw fashion’s supply chain into turmoil

Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs could reshape the fashion industry as we know it. Here’s what’s at stake.

“What’s even more concerning than the direct impact of tariffs is the broader effect on the overall economy and consumer confidence. Even ultra-high-net-worth individuals often gauge their wealth based on stock market performance, and this uncertainty has a ripple effect that extends beyond the tariffs themselves,” says Claudia D’Arpizio, senior partner and global head of fashion and luxury at Bain & Company.

US fashion brands are facing down the prospect of increasing prices and lost profits. For luxury fashion brands – many of which are still trying to regroup from a sector-wide slowdown in 2024 – the impact could be the difference between a recovery year and another in the red.

At the start of the year, analysts predicted that growth would return to the luxury sector by the second half of 2025, growing by approximately 5 per cent this year, with green shoots emerging from a post-election US, a rallying Europe and emerging markets like the Middle East. Now, according to Reuters, one Wall Street analyst is predicting global luxury goods sales could fall by as much as 2 per cent this year. Analyst firms like Bain have not yet published new forecasts, but the outlook is darkening.

“The forecasts are for sales growth to slow. Higher prices may well push up sales values, but they will compress volumes as people buy less,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “It’s not just about prices, it is also about the confidence to buy and, on this front, consumers are uncertain and uneasy. That is not good for spending, including on luxury.”

Immediate impacts

The sweeping nature of the tariffs have ensured that no country is left untouched, except for Russia and North Korea (while Canada and Mexico were left off the list of tariffs announced 2 April, previous tariffs of 25 per cent were already levied against most goods from the countries). The ripple effect across fashion depends on where companies are located and where they source from and manufacture: European luxury brands count on the high-spending US consumer as a top market; now, any goods sent to the US will be taxed 20 per cent for the European Union and 10 per cent for the United Kingdom.

US fashion brands that manufacture goods in Asian countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia have had to stomach the idea of double-digit tariffs on each country, which will eat into margins and likely force most brands to pass on additional costs to consumers. But in comparison to China’s latest triple-digit tariff, these duties may look like a bargain.

Already, before the most recent round of tariffs went into effect, duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico were causing price increases for apparel items sold in the US in the fourth quarter, and rising through Q1, according to Fflur Roberts, head of luxury goods at Euromonitor International, a data analytics company.

In a note sent on 4 April, HSBC estimated that soft luxury companies with big retail networks would likely raise prices by a relatively modest 3 to 6 per cent, while hard luxury prices would likely rise by the high single digits, as Switzerland tariffs sit at 32 per cent.

For luxury goods, a $300 increase on a $5,000 handbag may not make or break the decision to buy, but analysts say it’s a fine line. “Many factors are at play here. After two years of price hikes and significant inflation on luxury brands iconic products, even a modest 5 price increase could affect consumer sentiment,” says D’Arpizio.

Meanwhile, fast fashion brands (especially China-based Shein and Temu, which will see the de minimis shipping exemption for packages under $800 disappears in May) may fare better by remaining the least expensive option as all prices go up. Mid-tier brands that rely on manufacturing and sourcing partners globally, and especially in Asia, could bear the biggest brunt. US executives have put the estimated increases at roughly 15 per cent per item for items sourced from Asian manufacturing countries.

Brands can take steps like “renegotiating with suppliers, taking out costs in other areas of the business, and exploring price rises, and maybe absorbing some of the costs by taking a hit on margins,” says Saunders. “Price rises are somewhat easier for luxury as there is less price sensitivity, but volumes are already under pressure in the sector and some middle-income consumers have been deterred by a series of very sharp price increases, so this still needs to be executed with care.”

On the marketing front, brands are ramping up focus on storytelling that emphasises value, says Jhara Valentini, founder of Valentini Media Group, whose clients include Watches of Switzerland Group, which includes Rolex, Cartier and Patek. “Long term, we’re evolving both creative and media strategies to reinforce value storytelling, promote tariff-insulated inventory, and build trust across every touchpoint. We’re also putting greater emphasis on customer lifetime value—ensuring that retention, upsell opportunities, and post-purchase experiences are working harder, so we’re not relying solely on new customer acquisition in a cost-sensitive environment.”

Also determining how hard companies will be hit is where they are financially at the outset. “If retailers were already teetering at the edge, they are a lot more concerned right now,” says Deborah Weinswig, founder and CEO of Coresight Research.

Tariffs are top of mind as brands begin reporting quarterly earnings. “As we enter this period, we are coming from a place of strength,” Levi’s CEO Michelle Gass told investors during the company’s earnings call for Q1 2025 on Monday. Sales rose 3 per cent for the quarter. “We have momentum. The brand has never been stronger and we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate.” Gass said that any price increases will be “very surgical”.

Hiking up costs

Customers have begun reporting getting hit with hefty taxes and fees when accepting deliveries since tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico have gone into effect. With more tariffs now enacted, this could become commonplace if customers shop with retailers abroad.

Caitlin Burke, a stylist in New York, received a package that she assumes was a PR gift, sent from a distribution centre in Canada. Ahead of delivery, she received an email from UPS saying that the amount due upon receipt was $458.51 for fees and taxes. She’s not alone. Drew Michael Scott, an interior designer with 1.4 million followers on Instagram as @LoneFoxHome, posted a Reel showing a US Postal Service notice on his door saying that he owed more than $2,600 to get a Canadian-sent package delivered. A TikTok user says she was charged $345 to pick up an Canada-based Ssense package from USPS.

It’s not just brands impacted by tariffs: shipping partners from UPS, USPS, DHL and Fedex all incur import taxes and customs charges to ship packages into the US from abroad. Customers can decline payment and send packages back, but that can cause companies and distributors to deny future shipments. This could have an immediate impact on customers shopping with international retailers.

Customers could also start to see price changes on retail sales floors as soon as this week, even on goods already delivered to the US. Weinswig says that, in conversations with retailers, some have begun re-pricing items on sales floors to reflect higher prices. Others are investing in digital signage to be able to change pricing dynamically depending on how the tariffs play out.

Industry responses

If tariffs stick for an extended period of time, analysts say the US will go into a recession. This would spell bad news for international luxury brands who had looked to the US as fertile ground for growth – particularly as the economic slump in China continues. But analysts aren’t counting on that happening, predicting that negotiations and arrangements will be made in the coming days or weeks. According to the Trump administration, 70 countries have expressed interest in bargaining.

“While the new tariffs have shocked, they are not likely the end of the story,” says Saunders. “There will be negotiations and shifts. There will also be possible escalations as retaliation comes into play. This is not a settled state. It is a very dynamic situation which makes it hard for luxury brands to plan.”

The entire saga could prompt a reassessment of fashion and luxury’s supply chains, analysts say.

“When we consider the luxury and fashion markets outside of the US, it’s worth noting that protectionism was already on the rise, and it’s only likely to increase in the short to medium term on the back of the new trade deals and tariffs,” says Roberts, referring to limiting imports in order to boost domestic industries. “We may see a growing trend of ‘luxury localism’ or patriotic consumption among consumers. This could lead to a preference for British, French or Italian heritage brands that are mainly manufactured in these local markets or regions as expressions of national pride, craftsmanship and in a quasi-response to de-globalisation.”

That reinforcement of heritage also applies to marketing strategies. “Storytelling will step back into the spotlight in a big way,” says Valentini. “As pricing becomes more sensitive, brand purpose will act as the safety net. We’ll likely see a shift from performance-only messaging to richer emotional storytelling – rooted in craftsmanship, heritage, and meaning.”

Weinswig says that a silver lining out of this could be more communication between companies and employees, retailers and vendors, and brands and customers. There are a lot of inefficiencies in fashion’s supply chain, she notes, and the pandemic was going to be a galvanising event to change how the industry worked – but that never panned out.

“Every loophole that was there has gotten plugged, so that the industry as a whole has to come to the table and make it right. It’s forcing brands to rethink their approaches, put more focus on heritage and what they stand for,” says Weinswig, who says this realignment could prompt changes in suppliers and materials. “This is in some ways a positive because we have an opportunity to remind ourselves what we stand for and why we do things the way we do.”

D’Arpizio agrees. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, luxury brands excelled at listening to and engaging with their customers from a communications and marketing perspective. They must now continue this approach and invest in these efforts moving forward,”

Like the pandemic, that doesn’t mean this won’t be without pain, Weinswig adds.

“The industry is incredibly stressed. Nobody slept very much in the last five days. But at the same time there is a sort of excitement of being able to figure out a new way of working.”

“From a behavioral point of view, Levi’s is heavily tapping into the nostalgia effect with these reworkings of its famous ads from the past – in Pool Hall, shot-for-shot in some instances.
Clothing retailers such as Levi’s are facing a potential hike in costs as many import their products or fabric from abroad.
“We do believe that ... especially given the health of the brand, there is pricing power there,” she said.
Gass boldly declared in its last market update that it would become a billion-dollar brand.","According to Levi Strauss & Co’s latest earnings update, the company generated $1.53bn in sales for the first quarter, up 3% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis versus Q1 2024. The results exclude approximately $67m of net revenues from the company’s Dockers brand, which has been reclassified as discontinued operations as the company progresses with its sale. The Levi’s brand specifically was up 8% globally on an organic basis.

“While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. Since launching Reiimagine in September of 2024, the campaign has generated more than 4.3bn impressions and more than $65m in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our markets,” chief executive Michelle Gass said on a call with analysts.

A tie-up with the Bob Dylan biopic ‘A Complete Unknown’ starring Timothée Chalamet saw it launch a limited edition collection featuring Dylan's wardrobe staples. “This example is how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future, it’s further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage,” Gass said.

Thanks to both pieces of work, she said it gained market share for its men’s and women’s divisions in the quarter and recruited younger fans to the brand, growing share with the 18 to 30-year old demographic. Its women’s business has grown double digits over the last few quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues.

“The Levi's brand has never been stronger,” she said.

“Levi’s is staying true to its rebellious spirit and ability to tap into the current cultural context and how that context challenges gender roles and representation, once again turning the gender narrative and ideas of what is culturally appropriate on its head,” wrote Dorina DAmbrosio, founder and creative director at The Behaviours Agency, for The Drum at the time of Pool Hall’s release.

“From a behavioral point of view, Levi’s is heavily tapping into the nostalgia effect with these reworkings of its famous ads from the past – in Pool Hall, shot-for-shot in some instances. This behavioral bias explains our tendency to reminisce about the past in a positive light that leaves us wanting to spend money now. Coupled with the power of long-term consistency, this strategy has the potential to drive immediate sales.”

Sir John Hegarty, the brains behind the much-loved original ‘Laundrette’ ad, wrote in The Drum that he was “buoyed” to see the Beyoncé remake and that it demonstrated that “great ideas have more longevity than marketers realize.”

Tariffs

For all the winning talk about Beyoncé’s brand-building power, the elephant in the room during the earnings call was the looming impact of President Trump’s tariffs.

Finance chief Harmit Singh said it needed to “see where the dust settles” to accurately asses the impact, having avoided any direct blows this quarter. Clothing retailers such as Levi’s are facing a potential hike in costs as many import their products or fabric from abroad. In its 2024 annual report, Levi’s said it sourced products from manufacturers located in approximately 28 countries around the world, with no more than 30% sourced from any single country. Less than 1% was directly sourced from China (facing tariffs as high as 50%), according to Gass.

For now, it is still in the process of “scenario planning.” The chief exec said it was looking at working with suppliers to save money but raising prices wasn’t off the table. Thanks to Beyonce, customers might be amenable to it.

“We do believe that ... especially given the health of the brand, there is pricing power there,” she said. “But if we do anything, it’ll be very surgical.”

Another cause for optimism for the business is its Beyond Yoga brand, which was acquired by Levi’s in 2021 to take it into the lucrative athleisure market.

Gass boldly declared in its last market update that it would become a billion-dollar brand. She said it was up 10% in Q1 as it continues to focus on brand-building initiatives.",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/screenshot_2025-04-08_154701.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-04-09 09:03:47.272847

One of my members called this 'tariff hell,' said Bob Kirke, executive director of the Canadian Apparel Federation.

Retail groups in the U.S. have similarly warned that tariffs on Asian countries, where most American clothing is manufactured, will mean a steep uptick in prices ahead of the back-to-school season (new window).

While the Canadian apparel sector wasn't targeted directly by the tariffs, many companies headquartered here make their products overseas and sell to customers south of the border.

Canadian retail giants like Aritzia, Lululemon and Gildan saw their stock tumble (new window) after the tariffs were announced last week by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Access to the U.S. market is critical for brands in this country if they hope to grow past a certain point, says Emma May, founder of the Calgary-based womenswear brand Sophie Grace.

The U.S. market's amazing, it's huge, said May, who has customers on both sides of the border. We solve the same problem for the U.S. customer that we solve for a Canadian customer and there are 10 [times as many] of them.

But May is starting to reconsider some of her U.S. expansion plans.

Her clothes are made in China and warehoused in Canada, where they are shipped to U.S. e-commerce customers. On top of an additional 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods (new window) imposed last week, the White House has also said a previous exemption, that allowed small orders from China into the U.S. without tariffs, is closing (new window).

Maybe the U.S. market is just not something we can go at because our products will end up being just far too expensive for that customer, said May.

It's unlikely the U.S. will allow loopholes for Chinese-made products that make a pit stop in Canada before being sold in the U.S., says trade lawyer John Boscariol.

The Trump administration is trying to close up any loophole or potential exemption, said Boscariol, a partner with McCarthy Tetrault in Toronto.

And while clothing is a prime example, Boscariol says many Canadian businesses are likely dealing with the same problem.

Whether you're in clothing, apparel items, toys, whatever... whether that's China, Vietnam or any other country in Asia that's now been targeted with very significant tariffs, you're going to be impacted by this in terms of your access to the U.S. market.

Why not change factories?

Jeremy Oldland, co-owner of the Montreal kids clothing company Hatley, manufactures his products in China and India. He supplies pint-sized rain boots, pajamas and jackets to department stores, boutiques and e-commerce customers south of the border.

U.S. sales make up about half his revenue, says Oldland, and he expects that imposing a new surcharge on all those orders will spur a wave of cancellations.

We're going to sell less product. It's going to hurt any way you do it, he said. And yet shifting supply chains out of Asia to North America would be difficult.

We don't have the tradesmanship, the craftsmanship, we don't have the printing techniques, we don't have a lot of things [in Canada].

GraphicsThe full list of Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs (new window)

Aritzia, Canadian Tire, Groupe Dynamite among Canadian retailers shifting production outside China (new window)

Kirke, with the apparel federation, says the new tariffs are hitting the industry particularly hard because they seem to come out of left field.

In recent years, growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China have prompted some larger retailers to start shifting production (new window) outside of that country, a move that was also driven in part by reports of forced labour in China's Xinjiang region (new window).

But now, the U.S. is also going after smaller manufacturing hubs like Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where companies had previously been trying to diversify their production.

That's a hard, hard thing to deal with, said Kirke.

Kirke says he is glad that the U.S. tariffs don't hit Canadian-made products, though this is a relatively small portion of the total industry.

The hope, he says, is that Trump will change course and back down on his tariff policy.

As for May, with the brand Sophie Grace, she hopes to continue growing her business — but with an emphasis on customers north of the border.

We will obviously be looking to retrench in the Canadian market and then also explore other markets like Australia and Europe, she said.","https://images.radio-canada.ca/q_auto,w_635/v1/ici-info/16x9/sophie-grace-founder-and-ceo-emma.png",N,,2025-04-09 06:01:00.294401

Previously Sarig co-founded and led e-commerce tech company Aterian, until 2023.
Sarig and Kahan’s emphasis on agentic AI matches the marketing industry’s current obsession with the tech.
”Agentic AI tools carry the potential to help agencies realize their vision for generative AI to increase productivity,” said Greene.
Agentic AI, Sarig said, would enable agency staffers to make decisions about client search and retail media investments faster.","It’s the latest top AI position created by an agency group in recent months. Last week, IPG’s crosstown rival Stagwell appointed IBM and Microsoft veteran John Kahan as its chief AI officer (CAIO), while Monks (formerly Media.Monks) recently made founding exec Wesley ter Haar, already the challenger group’s tech pointman, its own CAIO.

Speaking to Digiday, Sarig said his ambition was to create an AI “backbone” throughout IPG’s agency portfolio, with a particular focus on agentic applications of the tech. Previously Sarig co-founded and led e-commerce tech company Aterian, until 2023.

Agency groups have historically struggled to attract and retain top tech talent. Before AI specialists, agencies and tech giants competed to pull in data scientists, for example. According to Jeriad Zoghby, IPG’s head of commerce strategy, the holding company offered Sarig his new position following a stint consulting with the holding company, as a means of keeping him in the building. “We created the role basically to put him in place,” he said.

AI chiefs are becoming table stakes at companies competing for the kinds of big ticket accounts that make or break balance sheets. They’ve been enlisted variously as figureheads for client appeal, boardroom lieutenants driving internal change, or group-wide visionaries.

Stagwell’s Kahan said AI technology would be key for Stagwell to meet its new goal of increasing its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to $1 billion by 2030. “You don’t do that with people. You do that with technology,” he said.

According Gartner analyst Nicole Greene, “the surge in appointing ‘head of AI’ roles across agencies reflects the industry’s need to bring a holistic approach to AI.”

The positions held by Sarig and Kahan are designed to “spearhead AI initiatives … ensuring that agencies remain competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape,” she added.

Despite the grand titles, Sarig and Kahan will function day to day as ministers without portfolio within their respective agencies. Kahan’s role is a strategic one attached to the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, its counterpart to IPG’s Axciom or Publicis Groupe’s CoreAI units. He’ll initially lead the division until its longtime CEO Elspeth Rollert returns from maternity leave, and then focus on advising and guiding the group’s AI approach. AI agents and agentic systems are among his early priorities.

“If I’m successful, I enable our agencies to do more with less,” Kahan added.

Sarig and Kahan’s emphasis on agentic AI matches the marketing industry’s current obsession with the tech. ”Agentic AI tools carry the potential to help agencies realize their vision for generative AI to increase productivity,” said Greene.

In IPG’s case, the role is married to a practical focus on commerce. Sarig is set to operate across its agency roster, but for now is working closely with performance media shop Kinesso on a food and beverage brand and a personal care advertiser (he declined to name the clients).

In Sarig’s case, IPG’s tasked him with leading projects applying AI tech to clients’ e-commerce strategies, while integrating Intelligence Node, an e-commerce data company acquired in December, into its day-to-day marketing apparatus.

The company is able to capture vast troves of data about a brand’s e-commerce presence, that of its competitors, and user behavior on the web, Sarig said. It collects so much data that analysing and effectively using it to optimize a client’s approach would be impractical without machine assistance.

“The only way they’re going to deal with that scale is with agentic systems,” said Zoghby.

Agentic AI, Sarig said, would enable agency staffers to make decisions about client search and retail media investments faster. “The ability to have eyes on the market and make decisions about your performance in real time,” he said, “as opposed to in the rear view mirror, [is] going to change the game in my opinion.”",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/manufactured-ai-digiday.gif,N,,2025-04-09 08:04:11.491718

President Trump to hike tariffs on China

The backstory:

President Trump on Monday announced plans to raise tariffs on China to 104% beginning on Wednesday.

The 50% increase marks a dramatic escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China.

Trump has already imposed 20% tariffs on China in February for fentanyl trafficking. He then announced a separate 34% tariff on the country last week.

Why it matters:

Best Buy relies on China for nearly 60% of the products it sells. Even before the announcement of new tariffs, Best Buy’s stock price dropped sharply in the first week of April, falling by nearly 19% in a three-day span.

Concerns over tariffs

What they're saying:

In its annual report to federal regulators filed on Feb. 1, Best Buy executives expressed concerns that higher tariffs, saying they, ""could have a material adverse impact on our business.""

In the report, the company said new tariffs ""could increase costs, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact the availability of underlying technology critical to our operations.""

During an earnings call a month later, executives again raised the issue of tariffs, mentioning the word more than two dozen times.

Corie Barry, the CEO, said new tariffs would make price hikes ""highly likely.""

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Higher tariffs likely mean higher prices, threat of layoffs

Expert opinion:

""Best Buy might not be able to pass along all of this to consumers, and so they might reduce some of their margins or some of their profits and that results in lower shareholder values – i.e., their stock goes down – or they might have to lay people off,"" said Tyler Schipper, an economist at the University of St. Thomas. ""The bottom line is that if you’re going into a Best Buy, and they’ve imported these products after Wednesday, they’re going to be more expensive.’

What's next:

The new tariffs on China take effect at midnight on Wednesday.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/04/1280/720/vlcsnap-2025-04-08-19h49m24s975.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-04-09 01:22:38.323173
ID28,Nike,2025-04-09 02:32:50+00:00,NBC News,"Sneaker designers, retailers and collectors brace for Trump's tariffs - NBC News",Curtis Bunn,,,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/sneaker-companies-tariffs-china-vietnam-taiwan-rcna200104,"But the Trump administration’s tariffs have raised the cost of importing goods from many countries, including China, to the United States.
“Small businesses like mine have to pay these tariffs, and it’s not a small thing.
So there’s no way to see this as something that’s good — for anybody.” The sneaker industry is a $70 billion-a-year enterprise.
A reporter asked Trump on Monday whether the American public’s “pain threshold” could handle the impact of his tariffs.
It’s unnecessary.” He said multiplying the tariffs by the number of shoes he has manufactured “adds up to a big number.","Devlin Carter created his luxury sneaker company, SIA Collective, six years ago and built it into a multimillion-dollar brand by providing fashionable, high-quality footwear manufactured mostly in China. But the Trump administration’s tariffs have raised the cost of importing goods from many countries, including China, to the United States.

And Carter is incensed.

“These are ridiculous tariffs that make no sense,” Carter said. “Small businesses like mine have to pay these tariffs, and it’s not a small thing. It’s a lot. So there’s no way to see this as something that’s good — for anybody.”

The sneaker industry is a $70 billion-a-year enterprise. And with almost no sneakers manufactured in America, the latest tariffs Trump has imposed have the industry — and the global economy — reeling, generating a ripple effect that puts the future of many small sneaker companies in jeopardy, Carter said.

“And it’s all unnecessary,” he said.

It’s not just the independent producers like Carter who are figuring out what to do next. Even sneaker behemoth Nike faces challenges, as most of its goods are produced in Vietnam, which was hit with a 46% tariff, and Taiwan, with a 32% tariff on goods sent to the United States.

Economist Peter Schiff said on X last week that it would cost Oregon-based Nike more to build production plants in the United States than it would to pay the tariffs. “The result will be fewer sneakers sold in the U.S. at much higher prices,” he said.

A reporter asked Trump on Monday whether the American public’s “pain threshold” could handle the impact of his tariffs. “I think your question is so stupid,” Trump told the reporter. “I don’t want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

The tariffs threaten economic stability in general and especially small-business owners like Carter, who relies heavily on shipments from countries like China, where 90% of his shoes are produced. His shoes go for an average of around $220 a pair, he said.

“Say I pay $100 to have a pair of shoes made in China,” he said. “With the tariffs, that shoe now costs $150 or more [to make]. And it shouldn’t. It’s unnecessary.”

He said multiplying the tariffs by the number of shoes he has manufactured “adds up to a big number. So what do you do? Most pass the difference, the increase, along to the customer. Even if you split the increase, it still can become a burden to the customer, because I know that with all the other stuff he has done — like gutting the federal government — there is consumer fear out there.”

And that fear could result in a decrease in sneaker sales, Carter said. He was able to ship more than $2 million in sneakers before the tariffs were imposed.

“People buy my shoes because they like them, but it’s a luxury item,” he said. “I don’t know how many of my supporters feel like they’re about to lose their job. They could be thinking: ‘I need to put this toward groceries. I think we’re going into a recession, so I’m not spending money.’ If you feel like your job is shaky and the economy is shaky, your way of life is shaky, you go into survival mode. And in survival mode most people don’t spend. And that comes back to hurt the small-business owner.”

Earl West, a confirmed sneakerhead, has collected more than 1,800 pairs of athletic shoes, which he stores in his home near Atlanta. That number is likely to rise much more slowly than in recent years, West said, because of the tariff-induced price increases.

“That pair of $180 sneakers is going to cost me $250 now,” he said. “So I have to be very selective on what I’m going to buy and when, because I can’t afford to spend $250 on a pair of sneakers every other week — as a collector, that’s what we do. We’re not, we’re not buying to sell.”

West mapped out his planned sneaker purchases for each year. The tariffs have upset that schedule.

“In some cases, I’m just going to do without the shoes,” he said. West often purchased in the United Kingdom, Germany and Hong Kong. “But they are all under tariffs, so now my effort in getting that shoe from over there may be severely hampered, because now I’m not going to go to the U.K. or wherever, because it’s going to cost me. Instead of $60 to ship it to me, it’s going to cost me $120 to get it here — plus the cost of the shoe. And that’s just too much.”

Sneaker resellers are taking a hit, too, West said.

“Think about it: As a reseller, you have to buy a $150 shoe at a higher rate than it’s worth. And then you have to sell it even higher to make money,” he said. “That’s going to be a problem.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250407-sneaker-store-LA-aa-522-57a780.jpg",N,,2025-04-09 03:51:45.384521

The overall Greater Cincinnati grocery market increased by 3% to $8.7 billion.
The 10 supermarkets with the largest Greater Cincinnati grocery market share","Kroger Co. continues to dominate Greater Cincinnati’s grocery scene even as its market share has dipped in the past year.

Downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR), the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, generated a 50% share of grocery sales in Greater Cincinnati over the past year through March, according to newly released annual data from Tampa, Fla.-based retail data provider Chain Store Guide.

That gives Kroger an enormous lead over Walmart, which ranks second with a 17.2% share.

Meijer is third at 8.1%.

Kroger’s local market share dipped from 50.1% a year ago, according to Chain Store Guide’s data. Slight declines were common among this year’s top players. Still, Kroger’s 0.14 percentage-point drop was the biggest among the top 10. Five of the top 10 experienced small declines. All but Kroger's were less than 0.1 percentage points.

Meijer, whose share inched up to 8.11% from 8.07% a year ago, was one of four store operators in the top 10 to gain local market share, although none rose as much as 0.1 percentage points. One held steady.

Part of the reason for the slight declines: The Trader Joe’s store in Crestview Hills is included in Chain Store Guide’s local market calculations for the first time this year. That lowered shares for other stores a bit. Trader Joe's, which has two locations in the region, showed up in the 11th spot, with a 1.05% market share.

Kroger’s total local grocery sales rose 2.3% to $4.35 billion, according to Chain Store Guide’s data. It was at $4.25 billion last year. And it achieved that growth despite its local store count declining by one, to 70 Greater Cincinnati locations.

The overall Greater Cincinnati grocery market increased by 3% to $8.7 billion.

Analyst: Results proof of Kroger's strong brand loyalty locally

Kroger is doing the right things in Greater Cincinnati and elsewhere to hold a strong market share position, James Lewis, senior equity analyst at downtown-based Bartlett Wealth Management, told me.

“Kroger’s dominance locally indicates consumer loyalty is possibly strengthening,” Lewis said. “The value proposition Kroger is offering is resonating with shoppers as management’s digital strategy is playing out. In short, execution as well as acceptance is high.”

The trend of slight declines in market share among the top companies isn’t surprising, Lewis said. They reflect intense competition and a broader lack of customer loyalty.

“Competition is coming from various retailer outlets like warehouses, online retailers, dollar stores, supercenters and European grocers (like Aldi),” Lewis said. “In addition, consumers base their decisions on price as well as convenience.”

The key to the Greater Cincinnati grocery industry is unit sales and dollar sales, both of which rose for the top local players, Burt Flickinger III, a veteran retail consultant who is managing director of New York-based retail and consumer industry consulting firm Strategic Resource Group, told me.

“Shoppers are shifting from fast food to grocery,” Flickinger said. “They (supermarket operators) are building a strong private label and value program to prepare for more competition. Private label is going to be a key weapon in that war, and Kroger and Costco have built the best private label.”

Next year's Greater Cincinnati market share numbers could look different as Publix comes on the scene. The Florida-based chain opened its first local store March 26 and plans at least four more in Northern Kentucky.

Market share has been a hot-button issue for Kroger Co. in the past year as it tried, and ultimately failed, to get its $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. Inc. approved by regulators. That deal was rejected on antitrust grounds based on concerns the combined company would hold too much market share and reduce competition in many markets.

But that wasn’t a factor in Greater Cincinnati. Albertsons has no stores in the region.

Kroger is aiming to further boost its market share, both locally and across its 2,721-store operation in 35 states, by opening more stores this year.

Kroger plans to invest $130 million in Greater Cincinnati in 2025 in opening three new stores and four fuel centers, renovating 16 stores and making maintenance and energy upgrades at numerous locations, Kroger Cincinnati/Dayton Market President Ann Reed said last week in a news release.

That’s far more than the $86 million it invested last year and more than four times the $30 million it invested in local stores in 2023, Kroger spokeswoman Jenifer Moore told me.

Kroger began accelerating new store openings across the company last year and will continue that this year, interim Chief Financial Officer Todd Foley said on the company’s conference call to discuss earnings March 6. It completed 29 major store projects last year and plans to do another 30 this year.

In the previous three or four years, Kroger spent much of its extra capital to invest in expanding its digital operations. Although it’s continuing to invest in that area, it has reached a point where it can go back to investing in more in stores, Foley said. Kroger finds that its most loyal and profitable customers engage with it both digitally and in stores.

“I also think having that additional physical footprint is a great lever for us to drive our share,” Foley said.

Harmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer at Levi Strauss, said during the call that the company has already imported to the U.S. most of the product it needs for the spring and early summer.","Levi Strauss & Co. said it saw better-than-expected financial results in the first quarter as it continued to increase its focus on the direct-to-consumer (D2C) business.

At the end of the quarter, the D2C business accounted for 52% of the apparel company’s total global net revenues, according to a Monday (April 7) earnings release.

That figure was up 2 percentage points from a year earlier and, as it accounted for more than half of revenues, marked a milestone in the company’s transformation into “a D2C-first company,” Michelle Gass, president and CEO of Levi Strauss, said Monday during a quarterly earnings call.

“Direct-to-consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings and strong eCom performance,” Gass said.

The shift to D2C will result in “more productive and profitable doors,” Gass said, adding that the company expects to build several hundred more stores in the future.

Levi Strauss aims to have D2C account for 55% of its business over the longer term, even as it expands its wholesale business as well, she said.

The wholesale business was up 5% during the quarter, driven by door expansion, more space at existing stores and a wider lifestyle assortment.

“Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, U.S. department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was 10 years ago,” Gass said.

In another change, Levi Strauss announced in the earnings release that it reclassified its Dockers business as “discontinued operations” in the first quarter. The company disclosed during the fourth quarter that it plans to sell the Dockers business, and it said in the Monday earnings release that it aims to complete a sale during the current fiscal year.

Asked about the impact of tariffs, Gass said during the call that Levi Strauss is well positioned to navigate this challenge because almost 60% of its revenue is generated outside the U.S. and it has an “agile global supply chain” and deep vendor relationships.

Harmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer at Levi Strauss, said during the call that the company has already imported to the U.S. most of the product it needs for the spring and early summer.

Singh added that in terms of share of product imported into the U.S., China accounts for 1%; Mexico, 5%; and Vietnam, mid- to high-single digits.

Gass said during the call: “I’d say our supply chain is more agile today than it ever has been. We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long term.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levi-Strauss-4.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 23:02:29.434654

Costco initially developed a wide range of names for its private labels across categories.
We decided we need to get one name.” A single private label may be more appropriate for the warehouse club model supported by membership fees and limited assortments.
Costco offers around 4,000 items in-store in contrast to 140,000 offered at other major retailers, according to Sinegal.
With only one or two brands per category, adding private labels created a fierce negotiating tool for Costco.","As Kirkland Signature marks its 30th anniversary, the private label has become a powerhouse, accounting for a third of Costco’s annual revenue — surpassing even industry giants like Procter & Gamble and Kraft Heinz. Given its success, why haven’t more retailers consolidated their store brands under a single name?

According to a videoed case study from the Wall Street Journal exploring Kirkland’s success, the only other major retailer employing a similar strategy is rival Sam’s Club, which consolidated its 20 proprietary brands into Member’s Mark in 2017.

WSJ’s case study pointed out that using a single name went against best practices at the time, illustrated by Sears’ success in hard lines with Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard but also the continued use of multiple labels across grocers, department stores, home improvement, and other channels.

Having multiple private labels enables retailers to tailor names to categories, such as Target’s use of Good & Gather for food & beverages, All in Motion for activewear, Cat & Jack for children’s apparel, and Brightroom for home organization.

One risk is that a bad experience with the brand in one category may cause the consumer to lose trust in the brand across categories. Claudine Adamo, Costco’s EVP and COO of merchandising, said in the video, “If they don’t trust the brand in the golf ball, they don’t trust the mixed nuts.”

The motivation to develop its own private label offering came after Jim Sinegal, co-founder and former CEO, read a 1991 Forbes article that showed Europeans were increasingly buying products manufactured directly by stores. At the time, national brands were increasing prices despite costs coming down to meet Wall Street’s demands for growth.

Costco’s move was designed to preserve margins. With its focus on value, Costco caps its markups at 14% for outside brands and 15% for store brands.

Costco initially developed a wide range of names for its private labels across categories. The decision to consolidate all of Costco’s private labels under the Kirkland name came after Sinegal found a warehouse manager who didn’t know a legal tablet the retailer was selling under the Pinnacle name came from Costco.

Sinegal said, “It was like a bell. Hell, if we don’t understand within the organization what we’re doing with our label, how are the customers going to? We decided we need to get one name.”

A single private label may be more appropriate for the warehouse club model supported by membership fees and limited assortments. Costco offers around 4,000 items in-store in contrast to 140,000 offered at other major retailers, according to Sinegal.

With only one or two brands per category, adding private labels created a fierce negotiating tool for Costco. National brands may be forced to reduce prices or upgrade the quality of their offering or be kicked off Costco’s shelves.

Sarah George, SVP of food merchandising, said in the video, “I think the limited-SKU environment is a very misunderstood or under-understood secret of a lot of things about Costco, including private label.”",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Kirkland-Signature-kasasagiproductions@yahoo.com-Depositphotos.com_-scaled-e1744157981726-1024x645.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 22:10:53.567491

Vietnam vital Vietnam has developed specialised factories producing everything from high-tech running shoes to track suits.","[LONDON/NEW YORK] Clothing and accessories retailers across the US are delaying orders and freezing hiring ahead of tariff hikes that take effect on Wednesday (Apr 9) on products imported from Vietnam and China.

These businesses, much like Nike and Lululemon, face an impossible choice: offset the cost of tariffs by raising prices by some 40 per cent – potentially cratering sales – or absorb the cost increase and further strain already-thin profit margins.

Unlike their bigger rivals, however, the smaller clothing and shoemakers lack vast supply chains, making them highly dependent on Vietnam and China.

Ian Rosenberger, CEO of Day Owl, a six-year-old New York company that makes backpacks in Vietnam, has paused future orders. Unless there’s a deal to significantly lower Vietnamese tariffs, Rosenberger estimates Day Owl has 30 days before it folds.

But with a production cycle of about 100 days, waiting much longer risks missing the crucial back-to-school shopping season. “The damage is already significant enough to be an existential threat,” he said, adding that his seven employees have been asking if they should prepare to be out of a job.

Rosenberger said tariffs would increase his duty to US$22 from from US$5, prompting him to increase the price of his top-end bag to US$212 from from US$155.

Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America – whose members include Nike, Walmart, Skechers, and Deckers – calculated that a US$155 running shoe made in Vietnam would have to be marked up to US$220 in US stores to offset the 46 per cent tariff.

Vietnam vital

Vietnam has developed specialised factories producing everything from high-tech running shoes to track suits. It is the second-biggest source of clothes and shoes imported to the US after China, and a key manufacturing hub for Nike, Adidas and others.

Vietnam has asked for a 45-day delay in the imposition of US tariffs, and said it would buy more American goods, after Trump and Vietnamese leader To Lam agreed on Friday to discuss a deal to remove the levies.

Nike shares have dropped 14 per cent since markets closed on Apr 2, the day Trump announced tariffs, while Adidas shares lost 16 per cent, Puma shares are down 18 per cent, and North Face-owner VF Corp shares fell 31 per cent.

These big companies work with factories around the world, providing them with some negotiating clout to split tariff costs with suppliers. VF Corp is “well diversified across our supply chain to manage tariffs,” a spokesman said.

Small businesses, such as Seattle, Washington-based women’s running brand Oiselle, have less capacity to absorb the cost, and fewer resources to plan alternatives.

Arielle Knutson, CEO of Oiselle, has asked her 14 full-time employees to work on two or three tariff contingency plans, on top of their usual jobs.

Oiselle, which sources leggings, sports bras and running tops from Vietnam, has delayed spring 2026 orders that would ordinarily be going out now.

Ordering the right amount of product – and not being stuck with too much cash tied up in inventory – is key. “It’s an almost impossible needle to thread,” Knutson said.

Ketchum, Idaho-based outerwear brand Wild Rye sources ski jackets and mountain biking pants from suppliers in China, which will be subject to an additional 34 per cent tariff starting Wednesday.

“This is going to create a huge amount of strain on the business,” said founder Cassie Abel. She has frozen hiring and any raises for her 11 employees, and said the business would have to absorb part of the tariff increase to avoid hiking prices by 40 per cent.

Day Owl, Oiselle, and Wild Rye said they had previously tried to produce domestically but quality was poor, so moving production to the US is not practical.

The space effect: It’s too soon to predict any direct impact on the space industry, which is set up to be highly regulated around specific, slow moving government regulations.
“In the aerospace industry, costs get passed along into the marketspace…Is the market going to bear that cost increase?
New kids on the block: Startups could bear the brunt of the harm of rising costs of parts induced by tariffs, according to Dodd.
Firms are also eager to understand in which country parts are manufactured—and where there are vulnerabilities to tariffs.","The weeks-long will they, won’t they on tariffs was finally answered last week when the Trump administration imposed 10% baseline tariffs on all goods imported to the US.

More details: The White House imposed higher tariffs on dozens of trading partners, including a 34% tariff on China (on top of an earlier 20% markup) and a 20% fee on the European Union.

Nations are continuing to implement retaliatory tariffs in response. On Friday, China announced its own 34% tariff on goods imported from the US would begin on April 10. That action sent the stock market into a tumble.

The space effect: It’s too soon to predict any direct impact on the space industry, which is set up to be highly regulated around specific, slow moving government regulations. That’s at odds with the discussion about tariffs, which have been happening for just a couple of months.

“In the aerospace industry, costs get passed along into the marketspace…Is the market going to bear that cost increase? Right now, it’s a lot of philosophical kinds of uncertainty,” said Ed Dodd, VP of business development at Cofactr, a procurement and logistics management startup. “We’re 60 days into the tariff discussion. The industry is not set up to move that fast.”

Defense programs are already largely required to rely on domestically made parts. However, supply chains are deep and many companies work with nations such as Canada and Europe—long-time trusted partners of the US that now face tariffs.

New kids on the block: Startups could bear the brunt of the harm of rising costs of parts induced by tariffs, according to Dodd. While legacy primes can absorb these costs into cost-plus contracts with government customers, startups generally work with the government under fixed-price contracts.

“They’re going to be faced with a choice. They either complete the contract on a loss…or back out of the contract,” Dodd said of startups. “In the government world, past performance is king…If I back out of a contract, will I get the next one?”

The good news: The certainty loving aerospace industry can now at least begin to plan for the tariffs, which have been on-again, off-again for much of Trump’s presidency.

“Instability is a nightmare. If you don’t know what’s happening, you can’t plan, you can’t execute,” Phillip Gulley, Cofactr’s cofounder and chief strategy officer, told Payload. “Feeling the pain and making the change, even if that pain is horrible, is actionable.”

Gulley also said companies are more open to meeting with new vendors to keep their options open. Firms are also eager to understand in which country parts are manufactured—and where there are vulnerabilities to tariffs.

Doom and gloom: What’s the worst that could happen? “Existential threat,” according to Gulley.

He spelled out a series of events that could lead to big trouble for the US industrial base—and for America’s competitiveness in space and national security more broadly.

A company’s costs of production go up.

The company raises its prices for its hardware.

The customer (largely the government, in this sector) refuses to pay the higher price.

The company stops making its product.

“There’s a threshold where the business model for this very direct product doesn’t work anymore,” he said. “It’s an existential threat and the company goes away.”",https://payloadspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/inauguration-day-article-1140x684-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 22:11:02.569368

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Levi Strauss & Company First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call for the period ending March 2, 2025. All parties will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session, at which time instructions will follow. This conference call is being recorded and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without written permission from the company. This conference call is being broadcast over the Internet, and a replay of the webcast will be accessible for one quarter on the company’s website at levistrauss.com. I would now like to hand the call over to Aida Orphan, Vice President of Investor Relations at Levi Strauss & Company.

Aida Orphan: Thank you for joining us on the call today to discuss the results for our first quarter fiscal 2025. Joining me on today’s call are Michelle Gass, our President and CEO; and Harmit Singh, our Chief Financial and Growth Officer. We have posted complete Q1 financial results in our earnings release on the IR section of our website investors.levistrauss.com. The link to the webcast of today’s conference call can also be found on our site. We’d like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Please review our filings with the SEC, in particular the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 1, 2024 and MD&A section of our recently filed Form 10-Q for the factors that could cause our results to differ.

Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today and we assume no obligation to update any of these statements. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure are included in today’s press release. Reconciliation of non-GAAP forward-looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures, however, cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items, including but not limited to, the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, newly imposed U.S. tariffs and any additional response to non-U.S. tariffs or additional U.S. tariffs and any future restructuring related severance and any other charges.

This call is being webcast on our IR website and a replay of this call will be available on the website shortly. Please note that Michelle and Harmit will be referencing organic net revenues or constant currency numbers unless otherwise noted, and the information provided is based on continuing operations, which excludes $76 million of net revenues related to Docker. Today’s call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I’d like to turn over the call to Michelle.

Michelle Gass: Thank you, and welcome everyone to today’s call. I’m pleased to share that 2025 is off to a strong start, and our shift to becoming a DTC first company is driving both strategic and financial value. In Q1, we exceeded expectations across sales, margins and EPS, driven by the momentum of our strategies. We again achieved high single-digit organic net revenue growth, up 9%. Direct-to-Consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings, and strong e-com performance. Our wholesale business delivered another quarter of positive growth, up 5%. Our U.S. business further accelerated, up 8%, while international was strong as well, up 9%, and we extended our market leadership with share gains across both women’s and men.

I am proud we were able to deliver these strong results while fundamentally changing the way we work as part of our hard pivot towards becoming a best-in-class omnichannel retailer. Given last week’s tariff announcement, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment. However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times. As an iconic brand with more than 170 years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality, and that’s what Levi’s has always stood for. Today, almost 60% of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. We have scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty.

I’ll now walk you through highlights from the quarter in the context of our strategy. Note that all numbers that Harmit and I will reference are on an organic basis and exclude Dockers, which as you saw in our release, has been moved to discontinued operations as we explore a sale of the brand. Let’s start with our first strategy being brand-led. The Levi’s brand was up 8% for the quarter and continues to reach new levels of strength all over the world. While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. You can see that through our partnership with the most influential artist of our generation, Beyonce. Since launching REIIMAGINE in September of 2024, the campaign has generated more than 4.3 billion impressions and more than $65 million in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our markets.

As another proof point in our ongoing efforts to drive brand heat, this last quarter, the Levi’s brand was featured in A Complete Unknown, a highly celebrated biopic of Bob Dylan starring Timothee Chalamet. Bob Dylan, known for his love of Levi’s, has shaped and defined culture across many decades. To commemorate the film’s release, we launched a limited-edition collection featuring some of Bob Dylan’s wardrobe staples. This example of how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future is further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage. We are also partnering with authentic, locally influential icons to drive brand heat and anchor the brand at the center of culture across the globe. Earlier this month, we expanded our partnership in India with Punjabi Superstar Diljit Dosanjh and launched a new campaign in Germany with Stefanie Giesinger, strengthening our appeal with consumers in both of these important markets.

And as a testament to the strength of the Levi’s brand, we gained market share in men’s and women’s in the quarter, further solidifying our number one position in denim across both categories. And consistent with our strategy to recruit younger fans to the brand, we also grew share with our 18 to 30 year-old target consumer demographic. These consumers transacted a higher AUR and purchased more frequently than our average consumer. Moving to product. While our history is built on jeans, our future will be built around lifestyle, always rooted in denim. For most of our history, we’ve been known as a men’s jeans business, but to achieve our bold aspirations, we need to be more. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly expanded our head-to-toe offering, especially with women, while maintaining our dominance with men.

This enables us to further expand our already large total addressable market. And as a result, women’s continue to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues. Tops represents more than 20% of our business, which has more than doubled over the last 10 years. Inspired by denim lifestyle, newer categories such as dresses, skirts, and outerwear continue to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the business. And while we’re the leader in jeans, our portfolio beyond denim bottoms now comprises 35% of our total sales. As we diversify our product portfolio, we also remain laser-focused on our core Levi’s bottoms business. And in Q1, bottoms were up 9%, driven by strength in both men’s and women’s.

The continued success we’ve achieved in bottoms is attributable to our fit diversification strategy. We have a style for everyone, for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15% of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Cinch Baggy available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volumes surpassing 200 million. And with men, we’ve been focused on expanding this trend through new fit launches like the 568 Loose Straight and the 578 Baggy. While there is so much fuzz around the Loose and Baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20% of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses.

We continue to infuse innovation and newness into these styles with a robust pipeline of new fits, finishes and fabrics. Our men’s Classic 511 Slim Fit is a great example now offered across a range of fabrics, washes and colors as well as part of our new tech series earning us more space in this closet. As part of our denim lifestyle strategy, tops remain a key growth category for us. And in the quarter, tops grew 7%. We’re seeing stronger growth in our Direct-to-Consumer channel up low double-digits where we offer our broadest assortment. There is a long runway for growth in our tops business and the strong demand we’re seeing in our DTC channel give us great confidence that this will scale to be a meaningful part of our business over-time.

Our pipeline of newness and innovation remains robust, and I’m confident this will continue to drive impact and resonate with our fans. We continue to see an opportunity to further premiumize the brand with the global launch of the Levi’s Blue Tab collection. Introduced in Asia earlier this year, Blue Tab paired our iconic Levi’s aesthetics with the quality and sensibility of Japanese craftsmanship. Our most elevated expression of denim leadership to-date, the collection features iconic denim staples along with new tops, skirts, and outerwear. And building on the success of our lightweight denim collection, we’re excited to introduce our newest innovation, linen and Denim, combining the authentic feel of blue jeans with soft light linen. Now shifting to our strategy to be DTC-first.

Our global Direct-to-Consumer business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, up 12% and posting its 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp. AURs in the channel were up mid-single-digits as customers are gravitating to more premium products as well as an intentional reduction in promotion in our stores. DTC productivity actions, including improving the front-of-house consumer experience and back-of-house efficiency are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel. I speak firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team. Our stores today reflect a more robust head-to-toe offering compared to when we were mainly a men’s denim bottoms destination, and we’re now showcasing a broader denim lifestyle assortment through top dresses, outerwear skirts in both denim and non-denim bottoms.

Our inventory levels are healthier with better in-stock availability and we’re equipping our stylist with enhanced product knowledge and improved selling techniques. The results of all of this work are more productive and profitable doors, increasing our conviction that we can build several hundred more stores in the future. And we are on that path today. In Q1, we continued executing our retail expansion plans. Notable openings include Rome, on Via Cola di Rienzo, one of the most renowned shopping streets in Italy and continued expansion across Mexico and India as we grow our retail footprint in these important markets. We have abundant opportunity to increase our DTC presence in major markets all around the world, including here in the U.S..

Our efforts to accelerate our performance in our e-commerce business are working, with the channel up 16% in Q1 on top of 13% in the prior year. Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our e-comm channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience. We have upgraded the content on our site with higher quality imagery that focuses on our lifestyle assortment and enhanced storytelling. We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our product in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for the U.S. e-comm business rising to its highest level ever.

Today, comprising just 12% of our total company net revenues, we believe that e-commerce represents another significant engine for growth. DTC ended the quarter at 52% of total global net revenues, up 2 points to last year, accounting for over half of our total revenue, a milestone as we transform into a DTC-first company. We are also encouraged by the performance in our global wholesale channel, up 5%, driven by strong growth in the U.S.. U.S. wholesale exceeded our expectations in the quarter, up 9%, in part driven by door expansion and more space with our broadened lifestyle assortment. Our Levi’s women’s business was a particular bright spot, up 17%. Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, U.S. department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was 10 years ago.

Signature, our value brand, also grew this quarter, up 19%, driven by strength in our seasonal fit. And as we look to the balance of the year, we remain prudent as respect to global wholesale. We continue to expect the channel to be flat for the full year on an organic basis, and this continues to be an important profitable channel for us. Now turning to our third strategy, powering the portfolio. Our international business represents close to 60% of our total business today, up 9% in Q1, driven by growth in Mexico, the UK, France, and Germany. International growth remains an important opportunity for us long-term and we continue to believe that we are underpenetrated. Beyond Yoga was up 10% in Q1. We are continuing to focus on brand-building initiatives to drive awareness and profitable growth.

Customers are responding to our broadened assortment of color waves and styles as well as new products like our LuxeFleece collection, expanded outerwear assortment and our lifestyle status trouser. And comp sales in our small but growing network of stores were positive for the quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We recognize that the environment around us continues to have uncertainty and we’re focused on the things we can control. Our first quarter performance demonstrates how our transformation into a best-in-class lifestyle retailer is accelerating both the top-line and the bottom-line. Our key strategies are being brand-led, DTC-first and powering our portfolio, along with our efforts to rewire our company to be faster and more consumer-obsessed are working and are gaining momentum.

Our team is focused on executing with excellence and I’m grateful to our employees around the globe for their commitment to the change underway and for their unwavering dedication to consistently deliver for our fans. I am confident we have the right foundation to capture the opportunity ahead and deliver profitable long-term growth for all of our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Harmit to provide financial overview of the quarter and our expectations for the year. Harmit?

Harmit Singh: Thank you, Michelle. We have started the year with momentum. Our financial results were better-than-expected and our transformation to a DTC-first lifestyle business is making real progress. As you saw in this morning’s press release, Dockers has been reclassified to discontinued operations. As you will notice, while Dockers was a positive contributor to sales, our gross and operating margin structure is higher, excluding Dockers, thereby improving the structural economics and profitability of our remaining business. Our focus on structural economics is reflected in the fact that net revenues, margins, expenses, and EPS were all better-than-expected. While global wholesale net revenues were up for the second consecutive quarter, our Direct-to-Consumer business continues to lead our growth with net revenues up 12% as we consistently execute the three things that matter most in this channel, what I call a trifecta, positive comp sales, opening high-performing stores and growing e-commerce profitably.

Besides the double-digit top-line growth, our Direct-to-Consumer EBIT margins grew 500 basis points in the quarter, contributing to the company’s overall margin expansion. This is helping drive sustainable sequential progression across our P&L. Q1 ’25 organic net revenues accelerated to 9% versus flat in Q1 ’23 and ’24. Gross margin was a record at 62.1% this quarter versus 58.2% in Q1 ’24 and 56.5% in Q1 ’23. Given our expense discipline in Q1, we were also able to leverage adjusted SG&A margin by 70 basis points, all of which drove 400 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion to 13.4% versus 9.4% in Q1 ’24 and 11.5% in Q1 ’23. Now turning to a brief review of our results. 9% top-line growth was driven by better-than-expected performance in both Direct-to-Consumer and wholesale channels.

Two-third of the growth was driven by units and a third by higher AURs. Turning to margins, we continue to see expansion in both our gross and operating margins. Gross margin for Q1 was 62.1% of net revenues, a new record. Gross margin expanded 330 basis points relative to last year, driven primarily by the continued benefit of lower product costs, favorable channel and brand mix and higher full price selling. Adjusted SG&A expenses in the quarter were up 2% versus prior year to $744 million from higher distribution expenses, driven by a transition to a hybrid 3PL structure. We were pleased to see our adjusted SG&A rate of 48.7% improve after last quarter’s elevated levels, leveraging 70 basis points versus prior year. Gross profit dollars growth outpaced the adjusted SG&A dollar increase, delivering a flow-through of 84%, driving adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 400 basis points to 13.4%.

Adjusted diluted EPS came in at $0.38, well ahead of our expectations and up 52% to prior year. We ended the quarter with reported inventory dollars up 7% to the prior year. We feel comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory and have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for quarter two. In the quarter, as planned, we closed 21 net stores as a system. However, this consists of 30 new-store openings, primarily full price Levi’s brand stores, and 51 closures, which were mostly underperforming franchisee stores in China. Our disciplined fleet review process ensures that the doors we are opening are productive and only the most profitable with the highest return opportunity remain open. In the quarter, we returned $81 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which were up 12% to prior year.

In quarter two, we have declared a dividend of $0.13 per share, an increase of 8% versus prior year. Now, let’s review the key highlights by segment. The Americas net revenues were up 11%, fueled by double-digit growth across both Direct-to-Consumer and wholesale. In the U.S., net revenues were up 8%, driven by high single-digit growth in both channels. Our business in Mexico was up 6% from increased traffic in our stores as well as e-commerce growth. For the segment, strong gross margin and SG&A leverage led to operating margin of 21.7%, improving 370 basis points to prior year. Europe was positive for the third consecutive quarter. Net revenues were up 3% in Q1, led by double-digit growth in key markets like the UK and Germany. Direct-to-Consumer continued to accelerate this quarter, up 11%, supported by comp stores, e-commerce and more full price sales.

While wholesale shipping was down in the quarter, given the transition of our distribution center in Germany, we expect wholesale in this segment to return to growth in quarter two and have strong pre-book orders, up mid to high single-digits for spring and summer. Gross margin expansion drove operating margin to leverage 120 basis points versus prior year to 25.6%. Asia net revenues increased 10% compared to prior year. Direct-to-Consumer net revenues were up 14%, led by double-digit growth in key markets like Japan, Korea, and Turkey. Our South Asia, Middle-East and Africa business, which includes India, was also up double-digits this quarter as improved in-store retail experiences drove higher UPT and better conversion rates in addition to growth in wholesale.

This quarter, our China business was flat to prior year, and we continue to have modest expectations in ’25 as our work to reset this market is underway. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 200 basis points to last year from stronger gross margins. Now, turning to our full year and quarter two guidance. We had a strong first quarter with broad-based strength across segments, channels and categories, delivering a notable beat for the quarter, and we saw solid trends continue through March. However, as you all know, there were changes to the tariff structure announced a few days ago. Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies.

We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs. Our Q2 outlook remains consistent with our internal plan. The impacts of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in the U.S.. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year. For quarter two, we expect organic net revenue growth from continued operations of 3.5% to 4.5%. This excludes approximately 2 points of foreign exchange headwind and 1.5 points attributable to the exit of Denizen and our footwear business, which implies being flat to up 1% for the quarter on a reported basis.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 basis points to 100 basis points, and adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of 5.5% to 6%. This translates to an adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $0.11 to $0.13, which includes around $0.03 headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate versus prior year. With this expectation, our profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, up approximately 20% versus H1 ’24. In closing, I will leave you with three thoughts. First, while the tariffs announced last week pose a significant challenge for us and the industry, our business and our brands have endured for 170 years, proving our resilience. Today, the Levi’s brand is stronger than ever with diversified global revenue, solid margin structure, agile sourcing base with deep vendor relationships and a strong balance sheet.

We are well positioned to manage through this uncertain time. Second, we delivered strong first quarter results and we’re starting the year with momentum. Our new products are resonating and driving market share gains. We have a robust product pipeline that will fuel growth in our denim and non-denim business for the rest of ’25 and beyond. We are making incredible progress on growing the Direct-to-Consumer channel to a longer-term goal of 55% of our business while also growing wholesale. Third, we are both transforming our business while delivering strong financial results and improving our structural economics as we continue on our path to becoming a $10 billion company with 15% operating margins. I will now open up the line for Q&A.

Q&A Session

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Your line is open, Laurent.

Laurent Vasilescu: Good afternoon, Michelle and Harmit. Thanks for taking our question. With tariffs front and center on everyone’s mind, can you provide a percentage breakdown of sourcing by key countries for the investors on this call? What are your suppliers saying about providing potential concessions? And then on passing some of the tariffs down the value chain, how much — when do you think you can raise pricing? Thank you very much.

Michelle Gass: Yes. Hi, Laurent. Thanks for the question. So, let me just take a step back for a minute and obviously the news on tariffs is very new. It’s fluid. This was just a couple of days ago, and I think we, like the industry, are getting our arms around it. I would say that as we enter this period, we are coming from a place of strength. We have momentum on the business. The brand has never been stronger and we’ve had — we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we are — we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate. And you’ve named a couple of them, but I’d first start with the structural changes, cost structure that we can make. As part of our transformation initiatives, as you know, we’ve made significant progress.

You see it again in Q1 with margin expansion. So we will look there first on how we can accelerate further margin and cost opportunities. Point number two is, yes, we will work with all of our stakeholders, that includes our vendors, it includes our customers as we assess and look at what opportunities we have. As it relates to our vendors, I mean, we’ve got long, deep relationships with many suppliers around the world. We source from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that we source into the U.S., I’ll speak to some of the countries in a moment. So that is definitely an area that we’re investigating, but we’re in the very early days on that, Laurent. So I’d say more to follow. And then similarly, on pricing. As we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand that there is pricing power there.

But if we do anything, it will be very surgical. As you saw even this past quarter, our average unit retailer AURs were up again. So the consumer is actually increasing price as they buy up into more premium product. So that’s an opportunity. We’ve also been pulling back, especially in our DTC channel and some promotion. We had more full-price selling. So that whole area is an opportunity. So I would just say more to come. But really we’re looking at those three areas, the cost structure, kind of the end-to-end stakeholder and supply-chain and then surgical pricing. And then specific to the supply-chain, as I said, we have a global long tenured on supply-chain. We source from over 28 countries. And the places that we source from are the places you’d expect from the industry.

Some of the key countries for us in no particular order are places like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, that — those I’d say, our top vendors. But it’s broad. And our — I’d say our supply-chain is more agile today than it ever has been. We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term.

Harmit Singh: And I think what we’ve disclosed, Laurent, into the U.S. from China approximately 1%, into the U.S. from Mexico approximately 5% and from Vietnam in the mid to high single digits into the U.S..

Laurent Vasilescu: Very helpful. Thank you very much for your thoughts.

Michelle Gass: Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey of — from the Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead, Dana.

Dana Telsey: Hi, everyone. Nice to see the progress. As you think about inventory levels, Harmit, how are you planning inventory levels going forward on wholesale orders? What are you seeing from the accounts? And Michelle, given the Beyonce campaign and some of the other activations and collaborations, women’s business, men’s business, how are you thinking of the denim market growing and what should we be looking at given the linen and denim and new things coming and how you’re thinking about pricing? Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Dana, a couple of things. Inventory at the end of Q1 was up 7%. The composition of the inventory is healthy. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for the U.S., we have products for spring and summer. And so that’s why we gave a guidance on quarter two. The other thing is, our quarter two includes March and the trends in March are stronger than how we exited February. So that’s a perspective on that business. We’ve been prudent in inventory planning. As we think about the year, as you think about inventory, the three things and now the fourth that we’re keeping in mind that was getting product in for spring and summer, largely because the tariff clouds were — there was an overhang even a couple of months ago.

The second for Europe is Red Sea disruption and the third was generally our thinking about the year. So being very prudent. As a reminder for everybody, we sell a lot of coal, right? So, a lot of our product is seasonless and we can carry it through seasons. And our balance sheet is fairly strong. We talked about the cash position at the end of the quarter and the access to liquidity. So we are in a good spot in a lot of ways. But we’ve been prudent. To your question about wholesale orders, global wholesale was up 5%, U.S. wholesale was up 9% organically. This was the second quarter where we have seen both global wholesale and U.S. wholesale up. And, so as we think and as we are understanding right now, there’s been no change to orders in from wholesale customers.

Inventory or trade inventory is very similar to 2019 levels. Just now, let me shed a little bit of a perspective on wholesale in Europe. Wholesale in Europe was down in quarter one. Essentially, as I said, because we are ramping up our distribution center, we expect wholesale to return to growth in quarter two. The best indication of wholesale demand in Europe is pre-book, which for spring and summer is positive and for fall is positive right now. And I think the second question, Michelle, as she asked you about the denim category?

Michelle Gass: Yes. So, Dana, thanks for the question. And I think to echo what we said in our remarks, we’re really pleased with the start of the year and the Levi’s brand has never been stronger. So, the Levi’s brand was up 8% in the quarter. And I think to your question, we’re seeing gains in both men and women, both in market share and in equity. So specific to the Beyonce campaign, 4.3 billion press impressions, more than $65 million in media value alone. But I think importantly, it’s having — it’s creating a nice tailwind to everything else that we’re doing. Specific to as we think about our transformation, we must preserve and drive the leadership position in men’s. But our intention has been to accelerate with women’s because we’re under shared there.

Women’s is now 38% of our business. Q1 was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Like I said, we are now firmly in the number one position market share in the U.S. and we’re growing that, which is really exciting. Women’s was up 12% overall across all channels and geographies. And then if you look at DTC, which is really the leading indicator, up 16% in the quarter and really delivering on that head-to-toe lifestyle. So as we pivot from jeans to becoming DTC, becoming head-to-toe, we’re seeing that in our DTC results up 12% and we’re seeing that in women’s and in lifestyle. So like I said, women is up 16% in both bottoms and tops growing. The team is really nailing it in terms of driving trends and fashion fits. Diversifying the fit opportunities to strength and losing value continues, but our core remains strong.

Western Wear continues to trend, the list goes on. But even in times like these, when it’s turbulent, we’re going to lean-in and please our fans with delivering the highest quality product at the great value and deliver that innovation.

Dana Telsey: Thank you.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Dana.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Matthew.

Matthew Boss: Great. Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Matt.

Harmit Singh: Thank you.

Matthew Boss: So, Michelle, could you elaborate on key drivers of the 9% organic growth, maybe consumer demand and market share trends that you’re seeing in the Americas? And, Harmit, if you could maybe speak to the cadence of gross margin in the second quarter relative to the back-half?

Harmit Singh: Sure.

Michelle Gass: Right, so I can start. I mean one of the things, Matt, that we’re really proud of the team’s efforts this quarter is really across the board, we saw strength. So if you take our geographies as an example, so our total organic revenue is up 9%. We saw strength in the Americas, in Europe and in Asia and Beyond Yoga, I would say as well as that carries forward another quarter of double-digit growth. The channels, both channels were positive, DTC up 12%, 12th quarter of positive growth, I can speak to that in a moment as well as our wholesale business up 5%. And I’d say its particular strength in U.S. wholesale. And then if I really double-click under DTC because that, the 9%, clearly the 12% is what’s fueling the majority of that.

It’s now 52% of our business. As you know, our long-term goal that we’ve put out there is to be at least 55%. So we’re making great progress. But if you think about DTC and look at some of the KPIs, the key metrics there, as it relates to our owned and operated stores, positive comp sales, we saw positive traffic. We saw positive conversion and we saw positive AURs. E-commerce up 16%, again, positive traffic, conversion and AURs. And so when you think about this, the growth is healthy and it’s sustainable. We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about two-thirds of the business and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up a third. So, this, as we look at the trends, we feel like it’s sustainable and it’s all coming off of the back of our key strategies.

When we say DTC-first, denim lifestyle winning with women, we’re seeing that across the board. And then your second part of your question was around market share. And as I think I mentioned even in my earlier remarks, we’re really pleased to see the growth we are seeing there. Both men’s and women’s grew market share in the U.S. this past quarter. Number one in both positions across both genders. And the other piece that we’re seeing nice momentum and growth is growing market share with you — that 18 to 30 year-old target customer as well as the premium consumer. So, there’s just a lot to like and a lot of momentum we’re seeing across all of our segments of the business.

Harmit Singh: And, Matt, to your question of gross margin, which to me is a great indicator of what the brand is doing, record gross margins in quarter one at 62.1%. So I think the best way to think about it is, half is driven by product costs, which are not truly just trade vendor negotiations. As part of our transformation efforts, we’ll — we’re taking a hard look at SKUs, we’ve reduced our SKUs. We’re taking a hard look at assortments that are not as productive as well as our newer innovations are great margins. So that’s one piece of it. And the other half, I would say, is a combination of mix, which is higher women’s, higher DTC, higher international, higher full-price selling that Michelle referred to, there’s a real focus given that our products are hitting home, we drive higher full-price selling and we had favorable FX given our hedging strategy.

Similar in — for Q2. So Q2 reflected margins will be up 80 basis points to 100 basis points, again driven by this. And a full year basis, 100 basis points. To your question about cadence, first half versus second half, the first half is really strong. The second half because our margin structure was very strong a year ago, the second half will be muted, still up, but, much lower than the first half. And, obviously, we are focused on driving more full-price selling. It’s something that is difficult to predict. That’s why we can — we continue to beat margins, I mean, and the other reason that’s driving higher margin is the wonderful DTC business is higher gross margin.

Matthew Boss: Great color. Best of luck.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Matt.

Harmit Singh: Thank you, Matt.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead, Jay.

Jay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Maybe just on the guidance for Q2. Can you give us a sense of that organic net revenue growth, how you see that by region?

Harmit Singh: Yeah. So similar, Jay, I would say, the U.S. low to mid-single-digit as you think about Q2. Europe, probably mid-single-digit, with one difference, wholesale should return to growth given what I indicated in Asia, again, mid-single-digit. If you think of channels, DTC, I would say high single-digit and global wholesale, flat to slightly up is the general thinking at this stage.

Jay Sole: Got it. All right. Great. Thank you so much.

Harmit Singh: Thank you, Jay.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Ike.

Ike Boruchow: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Harmit, I think two for you. Just can you walk us through the expense deleverage that looks to be implied in the 2Q after getting some pretty good leverage in 1Q and then it looks like the back-half should go back to kind of getting nice leverage to flattish. Just what exactly are the spending dynamics kind of taking place in the second quarter? And then bigger picture for you, it sounds like there’s no revenue issues for the business at all right now, but at least over the past couple of weeks, it might be helpful. Could you talk about the brand overseas? I think there’s some growing narrative about anti-American response to U.S. brands that there is a risk to what’s going on geopolitically. Would love to hear if you’re seeing any of that or if there’s any noteworthy developments that you’ve come across in the past couple of weeks? Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Right. So, Ike, I’ll try and do this in a speedrun. Right now, international business is fairly strong. We are not seeing any impact internationally. From our perspective, we’ve been here for a long, long time. Internationally, as a business, we’ve been around for over 80 years. So we’re not seeing it. We’re entrenched with the local consumers connecting really well and our new product offers that Michelle referred to are generally doing well. To your question about the quarter two guidance, so quarter two, just as a reminder, is largely — is our lowest volume quarter just from the seasonality. First quarter has a December holiday, third quarter has back-to-school and the fourth quarter has the beginning of holidays, the second quarter.

So seasonally it’s the lowest quarter. In terms of SG&A increase, the first quarter was up 2%. We expect the second-quarter to be up 3%. SGA — SG&A as a rate is in the mid-50s. It was around under 50. We still expect SG&A for the year to be around 50%. And this is prior to any actions that we take as Michelle referred to mitigate actions on tariff, et cetera. And the EPS decline relative to last year is primarily driven by the foreign exchange and higher tax. Even though foreign exchange rates have improved a little from the last quarter, they’re very volatile. They go up and down. And so our perspective is FX and higher tax will probably impact EPS adversely by about $0.03. But structurally, the business is in good standing. Gross margins, we expect to be up and organic rate to be up 3.5%, 4%.

Think of our reported revenue, reported revenue in quarter two, I said is flat to slightly up. And so that’s what the deleverage in terms of EBIT percentage.

Michelle Gass: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Harmit saying is just you think about the whole year, we’re obviously, think about our strategy is to drive the top-line. We’ll get some leverage there and drive margin expansion, both in gross margin over the year and in EBIT margin. And as you know we saw progress from 2024 over 2023, and we’ve guided the year to see another level of expansion there as well. All of this, of course, does not yet reflect the tariffs.

Ike Boruchow: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Ike.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Nardone of BofA. Please go ahead, Chris.

Chris Nardone: Great guys. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups. First on U.S. wholesale, can you just clarify whether your guidance is implying positive or negative growth for the remainder of this year? And then, looking out, it sounds like you benefited from expanding into some newer wholesale distribution points in the first quarter. How big is this opportunity over the medium term? And do you need growth in U.S. wholesale to reach your medium-term EBIT margin targets?

Harmit Singh: So, Chris, we’ve had two great quarters on wholesale. U.S. and the team, big shout-out to them. They’ve delivered U.S. wholesale growth in the first two quarters. I indicated, I think in the earlier question, Q2 globally, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly up. Our expectation in U.S. wholesale right now, we continue to be prudent. And so we think a flat number is a good number at this stage. Obviously, if we’re another quarter under the belt, we’ll talk about the full year from that perspective. On the distribution, you are right. Our opportunities on distribution in the U.S. is primarily around the categories we are growing DTC. We think we have an opportunity in women’s. We think we have an opportunity on tops.

And as you know, after the exit of Denizen and Target, we are working with our customers, in this case Target, to try and grow our Levi’s business and that’s making a difference. So as we think about opportunities of distribution and wholesale, there are opportunities around the company, especially as we grow the categories and both gender, women and men’s as Michelle referred to and the different categories as we pivot to a denim lifestyle company.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Please go ahead, Oliver.

Oliver Chen: Hi, thanks, Michelle and Harmit. In the past, what are your thoughts around frameworks around pricing and also when you look at tariffs in the past, what percentage did you absorb versus share with customers in different ways? And as we look forward, if you — if pricing has been something that you’ve adjusted in the past recently in terms of being — prices being too high. So would you take lower margins in terms of offering the consumer a good value? I know there’s a very dynamic situation here with tariffs and inflation.

Michelle Gass: Yes, Oliver, I’ll take that. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think the word you just said is that, it’s very appropriate, which is it is very dynamic right now. I mean, we’re literally in this, this whole situation is just a couple of days old, as you know. And I think as both Harmit and I mentioned, we’ve got a really talented team right now who is dissecting the problem and looking at all the levers that we have to address the issue, one of — two of which you just hit on, which is we will work with our vendors, with our customers to understand the best way forward. And then pricing is a potential lever, I would say. As we think about it, we will very much think about any pricing if we do take pricing very surgically.

Number one, one of the things we’ve seen our consumer do is they’re actually driving price up. You saw our AURs again this quarter increase as they gravitate to more premium products. So we expect that to continue. There could be more pricing power in our more premium products. So we’ll look at that. Promotions, we have been surgically pulling back more in DTC, I would say, on promotions and achieving more full-price selling. So that is something that we’re going to example — that we’re going to examine. We can test pricing in our DTC channel. That’s something that we can more easily do and understand the elasticity. We have recent experience, for example, in Mexico, where we successfully took some price adjustments based on the tariffs there.

And then what I would say overall, as we think about the Levi’s brand, we address today a broad range of price points. If you start at the core of our products, we’re at a very accessible price point in that $40, $50 range. Then we do compete in the value segment with Signature, that’s largely offered in some of the mass channels that’s doing really well. We were up 19% this quarter. And then we go high-end all the way from like, I’ll call it our Tier 2, which is in our mainline storage. You’re seeing more and more on that of e-comm, that’s where we’re in the $90, $100 range. And then even upwards of $200, $300 with Tier 1 and our new Blue Tab. So I share that in the spirit of we have a lot to work with here to determine what is going to be our right path forward, but it’s going to be really important for us to be super sensitive to the consumer and make sure that we’re on the right path.

Oliver Chen: Okay. And, Harmit, can you get inventory faster like now in order to address what’s happening or what happened with the inventory you have on-hand relative to the win and the methodology for inventory valuation that we should know about with timing of prices relative to the cost of goods sold?

Harmit Singh: Yeah. I mean, Oliver, we are looking at all options right now. I’m sure a lot of our partners and vendors have been called. And so we’re looking at options. We have been able to successfully air freight in the past when we were chasing product. The fact that we have inventory for spring and summer is a good indication. We’re also working on a faster go-to-market calendar, especially for the newer products. So, we’re doing everything that we can within our means. And to your question about cost accounting and depending on where tariffs, it totally depends where tariffs settle. It’s such a fluid situation and so we’re working through it.

Oliver Chen: Okay. Thanks. Best regards.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Oliver.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead, Paul.

Paul Lejuez: Hey, thanks, guys. Can you tell me how you’re thinking about the various macro backdrops of the major regions that you operate in and also how you’re looking at the competitive landscape currently? If you’re seeing any changes in terms of promotions either increasing or decreasing and just sort of what is the backdrop that you’re thinking about by your major regions? Thanks.

Harmit Singh: Yeah. So the good news, Paul, is Q1 is a good indication of the momentum in the brand. The growth was broad-based. All regions were up. Europe was up only 3%, but on an organic basis, but because that was driven by the ramp-up in our distribution center. And so as we think across the world, you know, Europe third consecutive quarter of growth, U.S. fifth consecutive quarter of growth, Mexico, second consecutive quarter of growth, Asia up double-digits. So generally, the momentum is strong from that perspective being global and 60% international, I think will make a difference at least from that perspective. Consumer generally resilient across the world. They’re responding to our new products. Our products offer great value as Michelle referenced. So we’re feeling generally good from that perspective.

Paul Lejuez: Any changes on the promotional front that you’re seeing?

Harmit Singh: Yeah. And promotions, actually, we are tightening promotions. I mean, that’s why the focus on full-price sales, you can see it in margins. So we’re not necessarily going the other way at this stage because the consumer is not giving us a reason for a change. And because inventories are generally in a good spot, there’s no reason to push that down faster or push price down faster.

Paul Lejuez: Great. Thanks, Harmit. Good luck.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Paul.

Operator: [Technical Difficulty] comes from Brooke Roach of [Technical Difficulty]

Brooke Roach: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your playbook should the macro-environment worsen? What’s the cost structure of your business today? How much is fixed versus variable? And how much additional SG&A leverage can you drive this year to offset higher product costs if the macro-environment worsens materially? Thank you.

Harmit Singh: It’s all being planned right now, Brooke. I think the best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is 2020 and ’21, which was COVID. At that point, our view was fixed and variable, I’d say between 65 and 70 fixed, the rest variable and variable had also ad incentives are variable, for example, but the last thing you want to touch, especially when there’s so much momentum in the brand, I’ll put it there. I think as you think about our stores, very similar cost structure, but even then, we actually grew our store base. We kept adding stores. And so we’re thinking through it. We’re putting everything on the table right now as we think through the three levers, which is cost initiatives without compromising the long-term stakeholder management discussions, which is customers and our vendor partners.

And the third is pricing options or initiatives. And so we are looking at all options Brooke. And then we have an international business that’s very strong, right, that could also be — we can drive some momentum there to offset some softness, if any, in the U.S..

Brooke Roach: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh: Thank you.

Michelle Gass: Thank you, Brooke.

Michelle Gass: Okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining our call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.",https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/15195219/LEVI-insidermonkey-1697413935300.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 01:22:45.411308

In a major move to strengthen its position in data-driven marketing, WPP has announced the acquisition of InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform known for enabling privacy-centric data integration. The acquisition is part of WPP’s broader strategy to deepen its investments in AI and enhance the targeting precision available to its clients.

Founded in 2015, InfoSum has gained recognition for its cross-cloud infrastructure that allows businesses to securely connect and activate data across multiple platforms without compromising privacy. While financial detail of the deal were not disclosed, the acquisition signals a clear intention by WPP to shift further into a first-party data-driven future.

Through this acquisition, WPP will now gain access to InfoSum’s expansive ecosystem, spanning data from global media companies like Netflix and Samsung Ads, along with retailers and identity partners. This will provide a strong foundation for clients to train AI models, refine targeting strategies, and extract richer marketing insights in real-time.

According to WPP CEO Mark Read, the deal marks a significant milestone in the company’s tech-forward evolution. “Bringing InfoSum into WPP is a major step forward for our data capabilities and the results we can deliver for our clients,” he said. “It allows clients to stay in complete control of their first-party data, while also giving them access to vastly greater quantities of high-quality, privacy-complaint data.”

InfoSum will now operate under GroupM, WPP’s media investment division, and its technology will be integrated into WPP Open, the holding company’s propriety AI-powered operating system. This collaboration is expected to enhance interoperability and unlock more value from existing and emerging data streams across the marketing landscape.

The move also comes at a time when marketers are under increasing pressure to pivot from third-party cookies and identity-based targeting, especially following data privacy reforms such as Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency and broader shifts in regulatory environments. InfoSum’s infrastructure offers an alternative, enabling brands to build custom data partnerships without sharing raw data.

Brian Lesser, GroupM CEO and former CEO of InfoSum, emphasized the long-term vision: “This isn’t just about enhancing identity resolution, it’s about unlocking a new era where data collaboration fuels smarter AI models, better audience insights, and greater campaign impact.”

InfoSum’s CEO, Lauren Wetzel, will continue to lead the company and also take on the role of Chief Solutions Officer at GroupM, where she will work on cross-functional innovations that leverage InfoSum’s tech to create solution tailored for both WPP and GroupM clients.

As WPP works to regain its competitive edge and drive innovation in a rapidly changing media landscape, this acquisition reflects a calculated step towards future-proofing its offerings with scalable, privacy-first solutions.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-1.png,N,,2025-04-08 22:10:42.526806

Even a little store like Economy Candy.
For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.
“If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.” Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp.
But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.","NEW YORK — Economy Candy’s shelves brim with sweets from around the world – gummies from Germany, lollipops from Spain, chocolates from Japan and a panoply of candies from across the U.S.

Standing amid it all, columns of bright jellybeans to his left and exotic Kit Kats to his right, owner Mitchell Cohen is quick with his assessment of how many of this shop’s 2,000-plus items are affected by the historic round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.

“I think all of them,” Cohen says at his store on New York's Lower East Side.

Few corners of the American economy are untouched, directly or indirectly, by the sweeping tariffs being imposed by Trump. Even a little store like Economy Candy.

Cohen had just begun to feel a barrage of inflation-driven price increases from suppliers ease when the tariff threats arrived. For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.

“I think it’s gonna be another round of this hyperinflation on some items,” says 39-year-old Cohen. “If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.”

Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp. Its name is emblazoned on a sign in a vintage, blaring red script, and crossing below its green-and-white striped awning, past the bins of Smarties, butterscotches and Lemonheads in the front window, an indecipherable sweetness fills the air, oldies music sounds overhead and customers mill around stacks of candy bars they forgot still existed.

It represents just a blip in the country’s $54 billion candy industry. But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.

Candy and gum prices are up about 34% from five years ago and 89% from 2005, according to Consumer Price Index data. Price, according to the National Confectioners Association, has become the top factor in consumers’ candy purchase decisions, outweighing a buyer's mood.

About a third of Economy Candy’s products are imported, crowded on shelves and tables near the store’s rear. There aren’t just “more German Haribo varieties than the Haribo store in Germany,” as Cohen claims, but gummies the brand makes in France, Austria and Britain.

They have every Milka bar they can find in Switzerland, every type of Leone hard candies that Italy churns out and as many exotic Kit Kats from Japan as they can fit.

On products like these, the tariffs’ toll is obvious.

Pistachio Snickers bars are from India, now subject to 26% tariffs, while passion fruit mousse Snickers are from Portugal, now under the 20% European Union levies.

But even an American-made Snickers isn’t immune.

While the bars may roll off conveyors in Texas, they rely on ingredients from around the globe. Sourcemap, which tracks supply chains, says Snickers bars include chocolate from Guyana and sugar from Brazil and are wrapped in packaging from Canada. All are now subjected to varying levels of tariffs.

“There’s a lot of ingredients in there that have to come from other countries,” says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade. “Unless you’re talking about something very simple from your local farmers market, almost every product relies on ingredients from elsewhere. Those indirect costs are really what’s going to drive up prices.”

The story repeats with American candies across the store – the boxes of Nerds and bags of Sugar Babies and rolls of Smarties are all inextricably tied to the global supply chain.

A table teeming with those domestic delicacies takes center stage near Economy Candy’s entrance. Cohen took over the store from his parents, who took it over from their parents before. He got his first haircut in the store. He was behind the register as a child. He took his wife by on their first date.

As a kid, everything on the store’s centerpiece table of American treats cost 59 cents. By 2020, the price was $1.29, but customers who bought a whole box paid a discounted rate of $1 per piece.

Now, Cohen can’t even get them wholesale at that price.

Today, he sells the items on the table for $1.59. Cohen calls the selection a “loss leader” but thinks it's important to showcase his store's affordability. Once the tariffs are fully implemented, he’s not sure he’ll be able to put off price increases.

“When your margins are coming down and your dollar doesn’t go as far at the end of the day, you really start to feel it,” he says. “But I don’t want anyone to come into Economy Candy and not think that it’s economical.”

The biggest-ticket implications of the tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention – the thousands of dollars a car’s price tag may grow, the tens of thousands that disappear from a retirement account in a single day. But here among the root beer barrels and licorice strands, you're reminded that small-dollar items are affected too, and so are the families selling them.

At its birth, the business Cohen’s grandfather started focused on shoe and hat repairs. But in the wake of the Great Depression, when few in a neighborhood of crowded tenements had money for such fixes, the business pivoted.

Candy, once relegated to a cart out front, took over the store.

In the 88 years since, business hasn't always been Chuckles and Zagnuts. The Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away and had sales sagging and the pandemic closed the store and forced it to pivot to online sales.

If tariffs upend things, Cohen isn’t sure how he might adapt again. He sells products that aren’t made in America and he sells American products made with ingredients from across the globe. He had just been making headway on beginning international sales, but the web of tariff rules may make it impossible.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/7b/27b747ea-d91a-53f6-bf60-1b0bcb448df0/67f519bb89718.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-04-08 22:10:48.200964

ID5,AXA,2025-04-08 23:36:26+00:00,impact.economist.com,Deepfake Fraud: How Organisations Can Protect Against This Emerging Cyber Threat,Not Available,,,,,https://impact.economist.com/projects/deepfake-fraud,"They just have to do something that causes its share price to fall,” explains Ms Chia.
Companies need to plan for deepfake risk mitigation, according to Vanessa Leemans, AXA XL’s head of cyber, UK & Lloyd’s.
“The question is not how fast you run, but how fast you run relative to attackers,” Ms Chia advises.
Ms Chia believes that the perpetrators of many types of fraud will start to use deepfakes.
The emergence of deepfake fraud could herald a period where adversaries run faster than defenders, who must play catch-up.","In early 2024, a Hong Kong-based employee of the UK engineering firm Arup transferred a total of US$25m to five separate bank accounts, before discovering that they had fallen victim to an elaborate fraud. The employee had been duped into making the payments as a result of a conference call in which all other participants, including someone purporting to be the company’s chief financial officer, were deepfakes — their voices and likenesses had been digitally cloned and manipulated with AI by fraudsters.

Although the scam heralded a new frontier in crime, Michelle Chia, chief underwriting officer for cyber, Americas, at AXA XL Insurance, a leading provider of insurance for businesses worldwide and part of the global insurance group AXA, stresses that this was an old crime committed with new technology. “Employees often receive emails purporting to be from their CEOs, requesting they move money into a bank account, which the vast majority have learned to ignore. This fraud was the same type of crime, but rather than email, it was conducted via a video call employing new techniques that capitalise on a lack of vigilance caused by perceived technological limitations. What is worrying is that deepfakes are now more realistic — and harder to detect — and that is only going to get worse,” says Ms Chia.

Deepfakes are not limited to impacting an organisation financially; they can also be used to destroy reputations. For example, deepfakes can be employed to imitate a company’s CEO saying bad things about their products, organisations or competitors. What is worse, reputational attacks can be carried out without breaching a company’s firewall.

“Fake news is a powerful weapon that adversaries can monetise without compromising an organisation’s multi-factor authentication controls. They just have to do something that causes its share price to fall,” explains Ms Chia.

Companies need to plan for deepfake risk mitigation, according to Vanessa Leemans, AXA XL’s head of cyber, UK & Lloyd’s. “Organisations can better prepare themselves before, during and after a deepfake attack, so they are better able to identify deepfakes, understand how to respond to a deepfake attack, and how to recover. But they must create and test these plans now,” she warns.

Employees are a vital part of the identification process. Most organisations have in place training to combat phishing emails. Ms Leemans recommends that this training should also include deepfakes. “If all employees are trained to detect and report deepfakes, an organisation broadens the protective net it can cast.”

The same practices in general cybersecurity also apply to managing deepfake exposure. Zero-trust user validation processes are especially useful to prevent deepfake video calls. Multi-factor authentication to access a video call stops adversaries in their tracks.

Although software is an important tool in the fight against deepfakes, it cannot prevent all deepfake attacks, especially reputational attacks. Ms Leemans explains that a deepfake attack is like any other PR threat. “Organisations must develop a clear, concise message about what has happened, and quickly share the company's position to nip it in the bud.”

While deepfakes are becoming harder to spot, their future impact remains uncertain. As with other cybersecurity risks, attackers and defenders are on a constant treadmill. When defenders improve their detection methods, adversaries improve their deepfakes. “The question is not how fast you run, but how fast you run relative to attackers,” Ms Chia advises. “Sometimes defenders will be winning. Other times, it will be the attackers. One is always chasing the other. It's an arms race.”

It is almost impossible to anticipate what the next fraud trend will be, so the best organisations can do is to proactively manage risk. However, even the best-designed programmes cannot mitigate risk entirely. This is where insurers like AXA XL step in.

Ms Chia believes that the perpetrators of many types of fraud will start to use deepfakes. She cites the example of the recent, eye-catching incident that targeted a luxury food retailer, where fraudsters used fake credentials to steal £300,000 worth of product. This is just the type of fraud that deepfakes could make more convincing. “We offer crime policies to cover this type of loss. The question is whether a firm has taken appropriate precautions to make sure they have identified where they might suffer financial loss, and how they manage that. The insurance industry works hard to keep up with the evolving risks our clients face, and provide the risk transfer our clients need.”

But, as her colleague Ms Leemans is keen to point out, insurers do not just provide a risk transfer service. AXA XL monitors what happens across a broad portfolio and identifies new trends as they occur. As a consequence, they can recommend to their partners on the most appropriate risk mitigation factors and controls to help them to reduce their risk exposure. “In the face of rising risk from deepfakes, cyber insurers play an important role by sharing insights to help organisations improve their risk awareness and protect themselves from these evolving risks,” she explains.

(Reuters) -CVS Health on Tuesday tapped former UPS executive Brian Newman for the role of finance chief, as new CEO David Joyner strengthens management ranks in his bid to turn around the company.

After taking the helm in October, Joyner laid out cost-cutting plans and named a new insurance head to help the company navigate one of the most challenging periods in its six-decade history.

CVS, which has faced financial struggles and investor pressure in the past few years, missed its earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024.

""A major piece of the CVS stock recovery story revolves around restoring management credibility,"" said James Harlow, senior vice president at CVS investor Novare Capital Management. He said bringing in an outsider with major company experience as CFO was a positive step in that direction.

CVS Health shares rose over 8% and were also boosted by bigger-than-expected increase in the U.S. government's reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage plans in 2026 that lifted shares across the sector.

Newman, who played a major role in guiding United Parcel Service through the COVID-19 pandemic, stepped down as CFO last year to focus on his health. The 56-year-old executive spent about three decades with PepsiCo in numerous finance leadership roles before joining UPS in 2019.

He replaces Thomas Cowhey as CFO and will receive a base salary of $1 million. Cowhey will become a strategic adviser to Joyner, effective May 12, after little over a year as CFO.

CVS expects its 2025 financial results ""will meet or exceed"" its previously issued forecast. Harlow said this indicated that ""the management has a better handle"" on the business.

CVS had said in February that it expects to earn an annual adjusted profit of between $5.75 and $6.00 per share. Analysts expect an annual per share profit of $5.91, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Embracing the rise of social commerce, Best Buy has begun inviting influencers to join its “new curated shopping experience,” a program in which creators earn commissions from tech products they sell to Best Buy customers via digital storefronts.

Customers can find creators’ personal “Storefronts” on creators.bestbuy.com, where creators are able to present collections of their favorite Best Buy products to customers, with links to their social media accounts.

According to the retailer, this “one-stop shop” highlights tech items already featured in their social media content and allows creators to earn a commission on sales referred through the storefront. There is no commission cap.

The program -- powered by marketing platform Impact.com -- has launched with three popular tech influencers, including Linus Sebastian (of Linus Tech Tips), who has over 16 million YouTube subscribers and 8 billion total video views, as well as tech reviewer Judner Aura (UrAvgConsumer), and Jenna Ezarik, a tech and lifestyle creator.

Through creator recommendations, Best Buy hopes storefronts collections will help customers seek out products with more confidence and ease. For example, if a customer is looking for products related to their wellness routines, a health and fitness influencer's storefront will suggest specific products they’ve already featured in their videos.

The creator program is another way to persuade influencers to showcase more Best Buy products across social media platforms, as the company competes with retailers like Amazon and Walmart, who have also launched influencer programs.

Benefit of Levi Strauss international sales amid tariffs Gass also mentioned that Levi Strauss international sales represent “close to 60%” of the retailer’s total business.
She added that Levi Strauss has “scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty.” Levi’s ecommerce sales In Q1, Levi’s grew ecommerce sales 16% year over year.
That follows 13% ecommerce sales growth in the prior Q1.
Ecommerce sales comprise 12% of total Levi Strauss net revenue.","Levi Strauss & Co., known for its denim brand Levi’s, continued its ecommerce sales growth momentum in its fiscal Q1, which ended March 2.

Levi Strauss reported $1.49 billion in Q1 total net revenue, with Levi’s accounting for the vast majority, at $1.43 billion in the quarter. Remaining revenue came from its Levi Strauss Signature ($56.5 million) and Denizen brands ($2.3 million). The retailer said its financial results were “better than expected.”

Levi Strauss direct-to-consumer sales, which include ecommerce, accounted for 52% of total global net revenue. President and CEO Michelle Gass called that “a milestone as we transform into a DTC-first company” in the retailer’s April 7 earnings call with investors. Meanwhile, Levi Strauss’ wholesale channel grew 5%, which she attributed to strong growth in the U.S. (up 9%).

The retailer’s portfolio “beyond denim bottoms” now comprises 35% of total sales, Gass added. Still, sales of the retailer’s bottoms grew 9% year over year in Q1.

Levi Strauss is also exploring the sale of its Dockers brand, which it has classified under “discontinued operations.” Chief financial and growth officer Harmit Singh said that although Dockers positively contributed to sales, the retailer’s gross and operating margin structure is higher excluding the Dockers brand. A sale of the Dockers brand would improve “the structural economics and profitability” of Levi Strauss business, Singh said.

Benefit of Levi Strauss international sales amid tariffs

Gass also mentioned that Levi Strauss international sales represent “close to 60%” of the retailer’s total business. That’s up 9% year over year in its fiscal Q1. She attributed the growth to sales in Mexico (up 6% as a result of increased store traffic and ecommerce), France, Germany and the U.K.

Since the announcement of a new tariff structure on what President Donald Trump referred to as “Liberation Day,” the U.S. administration has again made changes to its tariff structure.

“Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain,” Singh said. “We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.”

He said although the tariffs announced on “Liberation Day” pose “a significant challenge for us and the industry,” Levi Strauss has shown its resilience as a 170-year-old company. As far as inventory planning goes, Singh said the retailer’s is healthy. He cited “Red Sea disruption” as a result of Yemeni Houthi attacks on cargo ships as affecting year-over-year inventory changes.

“Given last week’s tariff announcement, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment,” Gass said. “However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times.”

In the U.S., Levi Strauss net revenue grew 8% in Q1.

She added that Levi Strauss has “scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty.”

Levi’s ecommerce sales

In Q1, Levi’s grew ecommerce sales 16% year over year. That follows 13% ecommerce sales growth in the prior Q1.

Ecommerce sales comprise 12% of total Levi Strauss net revenue. Gass told investors that the channel represents a “significant engine for growth.”

Levi Strauss is No. 156 in the Top 2000 Database. The Top 2000 ranks North America’s online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales.

“Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our e-comm channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience,” Gass said.

Among its changes, Gass said, Levi’s has upgraded the content on its site with higher-quality imagery. It has also featured more videos on its product detail pages.

Singh said Levi Strauss consistently executes on what he calls a trifecta:

Positive comparable sales

Opening high-performing stores

Growing ecommerce profitably

That came from increased traffic, conversion, and average unit retail (AUR), Gass said.

“The growth is healthy and it’s sustainable,” Gass said. “We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about two-thirds of the business and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up a third.”

By absorbing hundreds of skilled Liberians into its workforce, ArcelorMittal Liberia is directly contributing to national development through job creation, technical training, and the reduction of dependency.
AML Chief Executive Officer Michiel Veandermerwe thanked the management of the AML training Academy, and said ""your team, hats off to you... who made this possible from a higher level in the company?
Speaking earlier at the event, Mr. Anthony P. Kochen, ArcelorMittal Liberia's Chief Operating Officer, praised the graduates and underlined the company's high expectations.
The AML Training Academy, located in Yekepa, has become a national benchmark in technical and vocational education, producing world-class technicians, artisans, and operators.","Yekepa — ArcelorMittal Liberia, the country's largest foreign investor, has ushered in a new generation of local talent into its mining operations, formally recognizing 236 young Liberians who have completed intensive training and are now fully employed by the company.

It was a spirited and emotionally charged ceremony on Friday, as the company celebrated 128 graduates of the ArcelorMittal Liberia Training Academy (AMLTA) and 108 Process Operator Learners (POL), whose successful transition from trainees to full-time employees marked a major step in the localization of Liberia's mining and industrial workforce.

The event, held in Yekepa, was attended by senior AML executives and headlined by a surprise appearance from Mr. Kleber Silva, ArcelorMittal's Global Vice President and Chief Executive Officer for Mining, who flew in from the company's headquarters to personally welcome the new employees and affirm the company's long-term commitment to Liberia.

""This is not just a job. It is the beginning of a lifelong journey to transform your lives, transform this company, and help transform this country,"" Mr. Silva said, his voice firm but inspired. ""What you have achieved is not ordinary. You are now a part of something bigger--a mining operation that is respected around the world.""

Mr. Silva described Liberia as having one of the talents in the world, including the young people who have stepped up to help transform the country.

""He encouraged the young workers to be proud of their achievement but remain humble, focused, and safety-conscious.

""Mining is not just about extracting ore. It's about building nations. It's about dignity of labor. It's about service. And what you've learned here, discipline, teamwork, excellence will not only make you better workers, it will make you better citizens,"" Silva added.

""This is just the beginning,"" he said. ""Each day, a dream comes true. And together, with safety, passion, and pride, we will build something that will serve Liberia, serve its people, and inspire the world. You are not just operators, you are builders of a better future.""

As the crowd erupted in applause, the newly inducted employees stood tall not only as ArcelorMittal's newest recruits but as a rising generation of skilled Liberians determined to take their rightful place in shaping the nation's future.

For the new employees, this moment represents more than a career move, it is a life-changing opportunity. Many come from rural communities with limited job prospects, and their employment opens doors to financial stability, skill advancement, and long-term career development.

The employment of 236 young Liberians also holds broader socio-economic implications. Each new hire means a new household with income, new children who can stay in school, and new possibilities for the next generation. This ripple effect of opportunity cannot be overstated.

Moreover, this initiative plays a key role in reversing the trend of youth unemployment, which remains a major development challenge in Liberia. By absorbing hundreds of skilled Liberians into its workforce, ArcelorMittal Liberia is directly contributing to national development through job creation, technical training, and the reduction of dependency.

AML Chief Executive Officer Michiel Veandermerwe thanked the management of the AML training Academy, and said ""your team, hats off to you... who made this possible from a higher level in the company? I think this is very, very special, not only in Liberia, but in the industry.

He added ""It's very rare that you find this kind of investment in the industry, as Rebecca says. And it's really well appreciated. And it gives me a warm feeling in my heart when I see our people appreciate this so much"".

""So, well done, ladies and gents. We're immensely proud of you. And this is only the beginning"".

""Let's go and start that concentrator and do it and get it going. This is the beginning of a great future for all of you. Thank you for your hard work."", added

COO Kochen: ""You Are Trained. You Are Ready.""

Speaking earlier at the event, Mr. Anthony P. Kochen, ArcelorMittal Liberia's Chief Operating Officer, praised the graduates and underlined the company's high expectations.

""When I look around this room, I don't just see workers--I see the future of our operations and the future of this country,"" Kochen said. ""You are not only skilled and certified; you are ready to take responsibility for one of the most ambitious mining projects on this continent.""

Kochen emphasized the importance of teamwork, safety, and trust.

""Our operation cannot grow without your skill and your commitment. We are giving you the best, and in return, you are giving us your best. That's the partnership we want to build,"" he noted.

He recounted the enthusiastic feedback already coming in from AML teams working with the new recruits on-site.

""Some of you have already started contributing in the concentrator, and the reports have been outstanding. People are talking about your energy, your discipline, your passion. It's really fantastic. You're proving that Liberians can deliver excellence in any environment,"" Kochen added.

The employment of these 236 Liberians is directly linked to AML's Phase II Expansion Project, a multi-billion-dollar investment that includes the construction of a state-of-the-art iron ore concentrator and expansion of rail and port infrastructure. The project is expected to increase AML's production capacity and generate more employment opportunities in both direct and indirect roles.

The new employees will play a vital role in the construction and commissioning phases of the concentrator, a core part of AML's value addition strategy that will shift iron ore processing from raw material export to higher-value exports, retaining more benefits within Liberia.

The AML Training Academy, located in Yekepa, has become a national benchmark in technical and vocational education, producing world-class technicians, artisans, and operators. Many of the new hires were trained on internationally benchmarked curricula and are now positioned to pursue long-term careers in mining, engineering, mechanics, and operations.

For the families of the new employees, the moment was nothing short of historic. For the country, it's a tangible demonstration of how foreign direct investment, when properly aligned with national goals, can build local human capacity and transform natural resource wealth into shared prosperity.",https://cdn.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,N,,2025-04-09 04:04:25.671153

Travellers face economic uncertainty

US tariffs up almost three times

While the lowest oil prices in four years may translate into lower jet fuel costs for airlines, slower economic growth in Europe and Asia could dampen international travel demand for Gulf carriers, analysts say.

At Dubai’s Emirates, for example, jet fuel represented the company’s largest single cost in its fiscal year to March 31, 2024 – AED34.2 billion ($9.3 billion) or one-third of its total operating expenses – at a time when oil prices were hitting $90 per barrel and above.

Since last week, however, the price of benchmark Brent crude has plunged almost 15 percent from $75 per barrel to $64 per barrel, amid concerns that Donald Trump’s global tariff war could prompt a global recession.

Around the world stock markets have crashed on lower expected corporate profits.

“Gulf carriers especially benefit here, as fuel efficiency gains bolster long-haul competitiveness,” said Linus Bauer, managing director of Singapore-based aviation consultancy BAA & Partners.

This could be offset by rising costs and inflation, linked to higher tariffs, sustained interest rates and lower consumer confidence, dampening demand for international travel.

“A prolonged trade war or inflationary pressures could stifle outbound travel from price-sensitive markets in Asia,” Bauer said.

East Asia and Australasia made up more than a quarter of Emirates’ revenue in its last fiscal year, and West Asia and the Indian Ocean region another 10 percent.

Even as early as February, data from the International Air Transport Association suggested a slowdown in passenger demand growth, from 10 percent year on year in January to 3 percent in February.

US policy rattles Middle East aviation industry

Middle East fails to escape Trump’s tariffs

US tariffs render Middle East trade deals worthless, say analysts

That was before Trump announced on April 2 a near tripling in US effective tariff rates from 9 percent to 25 percent, the highest in more than a century.

The effective tariff rate – which is tariffs as a percentage of total US imports, taking into account different rates on different products and on different countries – was 2.5 percent before Trump’s election.

“While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,” Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve said on April 4.

The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth, Powell said.",https://www.agbi.com/tachyon/2025/04/refuelling-plane.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 06:01:07.897526

The committee passed House Bill 1150 by Rep. Jeremiah Moore, R-Clarendon, and Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, by a voice vote. Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, voted no.

The bill passed the House on April 3 by a count of 89-4, with three not voting and four voting present. The bill now heads to the full Senate.

Pharmacy benefit managers manage prescription drug benefits for health insurers and other payers. By processing drug claims, they effectively set the rates at which pharmacies are reimbursed for their services, as well as provide the reimbursements.

The four largest PBMs control 70% of the market, according to the American Medical Association. CVS Health controls 21.3%, OptumRx controls 20.8%, Express Scripts controls 17.1%, and Prime Therapeutics controls 10.3%.

They also are “vertically integrated” in that they operate their own retail establishments that compete against the independent pharmacies they reimburse. CVS operates 23 pharmacies in Arkansas.

THE DEBATE FOR AND AGAINST

Hammer told the committee that PBMs are steering patients to their out-of-state pharmacies while inflating prices. He said the bill “simply says you can’t be a PBM that both sets the price for themselves and their competition.”

John Vinson, Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO, said Arkansas has had a net loss of 65 pharmacies in Arkansas as a result of PBMs’ anti-competitive practices. A pharmacy in Pine Bluff closed last week.

Greg Reybold with the American Pharmacy Cooperative, which represents more than 80 Arkansas independent pharmacies, said a Mississippi audit found one PBM had paid its pharmacies more than competitors in 75,000 claims.

“I would go so far as to say that today, Arkansas is the center of the pharmacy universe, because you guys are on the verge of pushing forward a solution that will be comprehensive, and it will be complete,” he said.

Irvin expressed frustration that the Legislature has tried in the past to address the issue, saying the state cannot fix what the policymakers at the federal level will not fix. She said the government is picking winners and losers and shutting out competition.

Randy Zook, president and CEO of the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce, testified in opposition to the bill, saying lawmakers have passed legislation to regulate PBMs, and if there is a problem, the law needs to be enforced. He said vertical integration is common and often used by large organizations, and the bill’s purpose was to remove competition from the marketplace.

He said consumers may like the convenience of mail order pharmacies or of shopping at a particular location.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, expressed surprise that the chamber would side with the “oligarchs,” arguing the Arkansas Constitution says monopolies “are contrary to the genius of a republic.” Sen. Reginald Murdock, D-Marianna, said pharmacy patients are not as free to choose another provider as they are to choose a fast food restaurant.

CVS Pharmacy District Leader Ashley Ellis, a pharmacist and Greenbrier resident, testified she would lose her job if the bill passes, as would hundreds of her colleagues. She said passing the bill would reduce options for patients.

“We are not just professionals behind the counter,” she said. “We are your neighbors, friends and family members. We are deeply embedded in the fabric of the communities we serve, providing care and guidance to 340,000 Arkansans who rely on us every year.”

In his closing remarks, Hammer expressed sympathy for those who might lose their job. However, he said he also has sympathy for those who have already lost their job.

His district had a CVS that closed suddenly and another large local pharmacy that closed because of cash flow issues. Local pharmacies along with Walgreens, Walmart and Harps Foods Stores picked up the slack. Furthermore, local pharmacies invest in their communities, he said.

Senators could consider HB 1150 as early as Wednesday in the full Senate. If approved, it would go to Gov. Sarah Sanders for signature or veto.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pillbottle-medicine.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 18:07:57.468537

In APAC, the Philippines and Indonesia led in gaming app install and session growth.
The Philippines saw a 4% increase in installs and 9% in sessions, while Indonesia recorded 21% growth in installs and 6% in sessions.

Mobile game installs in the region rose 4% YoY in 2024, despite a 3% dip in sessions, signaling opportunities for marketers to refine retention strategies and maximize long-term player engagement.

“Despite market shifts, mobile gaming in APAC remains on a strong growth trajectory,” said April Tayson, Regional Vice President for INSEAU at Adjust. “As mobile-first adoption accelerates, it’s developers and marketers focusing on long-term player engagement — rather than short-term gains — who will be best positioned to thrive. Leveraging the power of AI-driven personalization and hybrid monetization, to name a few, will be key in building sustainable success in this dynamic industry.”

Globally, the report highlights a mixed outlook. While LATAM (+8% installs, +7% sessions) and MENA (+10% installs, +5% sessions) saw strong momentum, North America (-11% installs, -14% sessions) and Europe (-1% installs, -6% sessions) faced engagement challenges, underscoring the need for strategic adaptation.

Gaming sessions and installs increase globally, with the Philippines and Indonesia at the forefront of APAC

Adjust data shows that in 2024, hyper casual games led global installs (27%) but accounted for only 11% of sessions, highlighting high churn. In contrast, action games, with just 10% of installs, drove 21% of sessions and the longest average playtime (45.15 mins), indicating strong retention. Strategy apps saw the highest YoY install growth (+83%), while casino (+32%) and arcade (+23%) apps led in session growth, reflecting high engagement.

In APAC, the Philippines and Indonesia led in gaming app install and session growth. The Philippines saw a 4% increase in installs and 9% in sessions, while Indonesia recorded 21% growth in installs and 6% in sessions. Meanwhile, other markets showed mixed results: India saw a 2% rise in installs but a 1% drop in sessions, while Vietnam experienced a slight 0.3% uptick in installs but a sharp 18% decline in sessions.

In terms of regional session lengths, APAC had a slight increase with users logging in 34.84 minutes per session in 2024 compared to 34.32 minutes in 2023, and longer than the global average of 30.75 minutes per session. Indonesia recorded the longest gaming sessions in 2024, at an average of 44.31 minutes, with the Philippines (43.4) and Singapore (39.14) following closely. Thailand and South Korea remained strong – both exceeding 35 minutes.

ATT opt-in rates are seeing incremental growth globally, especially APAC

Gaming App Tracking Transparency (ATT) opt-in rates increased slightly in Q1 of 2025 to 40% from 38% in the same quarter of 2024. Big contributors to this growth are attributed to India (from 43% to 44.2%), Indonesia (from 54.2% to 58.6%), Malaysia (from 46.9% to 51.9%), Philippines (from 41.6% to 47.4%), Singapore (from 26% to 29%) and Thailand (from 49.7% to 51.4%)

Globally, arcade games saw the most significant growth, with opt-ins jumping from 42.4% to 59.3%. Sports (54.1%), casino (38.3%), and action (45.9%) games also saw gains, while hyper casuals experienced a slight drop.

Key overall shifts Adjust observed in the mobile gaming industry globally in 2025 include:

Completion of Strategic CapEx Projects and New Senior Hires Driving Robust Revenue and Margin Growth

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama's Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.

Financial Summary:

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 & Subsequent Operational Highlights:

Secured new customers and product launches including Wal-Mart, all Albertsons' regions, all 8 Costco regions, a first item into Kroger's HomeChef division, Lidl, BJ's, a major C-Store launch at Sheetz, and new Meals for One via Amazon Fresh.

Secured the Company's first-ever fixed-price protein contracts for both beef and chicken, hedging commodity cost risks for at least 50% of the Company's projected FY 2026 volume.

Completed build-out of industry-leading senior management team with the appointments of end-to-end supply chain leader Skip Tappan to the role of Chief Operating Officer and of veteran CPG and Retail executive Chris Darling as Chief Commercial Officer.

Invited to present at leading investor conferences nationally, including the 2025 ICR Conference, 37th Annual Roth Conference, Raymond James Small Cap Summit, 15th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference, 13th Annual ROTH Deer Valley Event and the 2025 Planet MicroCap Showcase.

Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 were $7.2 million, as compared to $11.0 million as of January 31, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by $5.1 million in capital investments and $3.6 million of debt paydown during the fiscal year.

Management Commentary

""The fourth quarter of 2025 was highlighted by a robust 25.7% revenue growth, to a record $33.6 million, and the highest quarterly gross margin for the fiscal year at 27.0%, with the completion of CapEx investments to double our grilled chicken throughput, positioning us for the next leg up in growth, as reflected in the market share gains we saw this quarter,” said Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama's Creations. ""Construction-related disruptions at our Farmingdale facility that had been impacting gross margins were firmly behind us in September, putting us back on track toward our near-term target in the high 20% range. While commodities and tariffs continue to put pressure on the macroeconomic environment, we have positioned ourselves well in anticipation of potential future macro headwinds. With over half of our expected protein needs for the new fiscal year locked in via fixed-price agreements, we are better prepared than ever to weather any macro headwinds.

""Emphasis on our 4 Cs - Cost, Controls, Culture and Catapult - during the quarter was supported by continued automation and operational efficiency improvements across the organization. This included the aforementioned CapEx investments that were completed in September, as well as labor cost savings through a new lower overtime staffing model that was fully implemented in January, and additional procurement efficiencies and recent upgrades to our existing grills that will drive meaningful improvements in throughput. We continue to focus on selling new products that leverage the entire chicken breast, which allows us to trim more often, creating a cycle of higher gross margins through significant cost savings. By mid-year, we expect to trim most of our chicken in-house, from a small minority today.

""Taken together, we believe we now have the world-class operational asset base and team in place to fully optimize operations, execute on our Catapult growth plan and identify, acquire and integrate future M&A opportunities. With these strong fundamentals, we believe we are well-positioned to emerge as a dominant player and a consolidator in the prepared foods space. Our marketing has grown to capture new customers, cohorts and occasions, and our team is selling with confidence and fulfilling pent-up demand. This has driven the robust 19.4% growth we saw in fiscal 2025, nearly double last year's growth, all while building the foundation for an even stronger fiscal 2026,” concluded Michaels.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results

Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 25.7%, to $33.6 million, as compared to $26.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Revenue for fiscal 2025 increased 19.4% to $123.3 million, as compared to $103.3 million in the prior year. The increase was largely attributable to volume gains driven by same-customer cross-selling of new items, high ROI trade promotions to drive higher velocities in existing customers and new customer door expansion. Targeted pricing actions were successfully put in place and implemented to ensure the Company maintained gross margin targets.

Gross profit increased 16.1%, to $9.1 million, or 27.0% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $7.8 million, or 29.3% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $30.5 million, or 24.8% of total revenues, in fiscal 2025, as compared to $30.3 million, or 29.4% of total revenues, in the prior year. The difference in gross margin was primarily attributable to commodity cost increases from historical averages as well as a non-recurring impact from construction surrounding the now-completed installation of strategic CapEx projects at the Company's Farmingdale, NY facility.

Operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $5.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 21.3% from 21.9%. Operating expenses totaled $25.7 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2025 at 20.8% of sales. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter benefitted from increased operating leverage, partially offset by strategic new hires to build capabilities, as well as a 93% year-over-year increase in marketing spend across the entirety of the fiscal year - an area of historical underinvestment - to help drive repeatable and profitable growth.

Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to $1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Net income for fiscal 2025 totaled $3.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income totaled 4.8% of revenue, as compared to 5.3% in the same year-ago quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 8.7% to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $9.2 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $11.7 million in the prior year.

Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 totaled to $7.2 million, as compared to $11.0 million as of January 31, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by $5.1 million in strategic capital investments and $3.6 million of debt paydown year-to-date, partially offset by working capital improvements. As of January 31, 2025, total debt stood at $5.1 million, as compared to $8.7 million as of January 31, 2024.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure - adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company's results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. For a definition and reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, its corresponding GAAP measure, please see the reconciliation table shown in this press release below.

Last quarter, McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4%, compared to the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected.
Its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October.
For its Q1 results, total same-store sales was down 4% year over year.
International same-store sales fell 4%, and China sales dropped 6%.","As companies scramble to respond to Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs, anti-American sentiment towards US brands is emerging as another concern.

A baseline tariff of 10% went into effect on April 5, while higher reciprocal tariffs are set to begin on April 9.

For food chains, the headwind from tariffs on commodity imports is relatively small, as many ingredients are domestically grown and most imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). But brands like McDonald's (MCD), Yum! Brands (YUM), Starbucks (SBUX), and Domino's (DPZ) have exposure to international markets that could hurt them as customers pull back, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said.

""The bigger issue, in my mind, is the anti-American pushback in these countries on Western or US brands ... we'll see ... what companies say when they start reporting in the next couple of weeks, if they're starting to see that already,"" Saleh told Yahoo Finance.

Goldman Sachs estimates that foreign boycotts overall will cut US GDP by 0.1% to 0.3% this year, meaning a hit of roughly $28 billion to $83 billion.

Major fast food players were only beginning to turn the tide in their international business after the pandemic. China's ""zero-COVID policy"" lasted for three years, far longer than US policies. The stringent, prolonged shutdown had major implications for international sales.

Last quarter, McDonald's global same-store sales grew 0.4%, compared to the 0.91% decrease that Wall Street expected. Its US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October.

McDonald's international-owned stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, which CFO Ian Borden attributed to the lapse of the impact of the Israeli conflict, plus growth in Japan and ""encouraging signs of stabilization"" in China.

Starbucks is still struggling to see a rebound in its international business. For its Q1 results, total same-store sales was down 4% year over year. International same-store sales fell 4%, and China sales dropped 6%.

Starbucks is facing a stagnant domestic economy and fierce local competition in China. CEO Brian Niccol said he visited and saw firsthand ""how dynamic the market is and the opportunities ahead.""

Prior to Niccol joining, the team said it was in the ""very early stages"" of exploring joint ventures and strategic partnerships in technology, real estate, and supply chain in the country.

For Yum China (YUMC), which separated from the US operation back in 2016, fourth quarter same-store sales fell 1% for KFC and 2% for Pizza Hut. CEO Joey Wat called it a ""challenging environment"" with ""value-minded consumers.""

Domino's global retail sales grew 4.4% in its latest quarter. CFO Sandeep Reddy told investors, ""As we look ahead to 2025, we continue to believe that global retail sales growth should be generally in line with 2024.""

MCD YUM SBUX

International growth is a key component for fast food players, which have seen flagging foot traffic and appetite in the US as competition from fast casual players like Chipotle (CMG) ramp up.

McDonald's put forth aggressive growth plans at the end of 2023, including expanding to 50,000 global restaurants by 2027, the fastest pace of growth in its 68-year history. That same year, it agreed to buy back Carlyle's minority ownership stake in its China business for a reported $1.8 billion.

By 2025, Starbucks said it wanted to have 9,000 stores in China. As of the last quarter, the US and China make up 61% of the company's portfolio, with 17,049 and 7,685 stores in the two countries, respectively.

Chipotle (CMG) is also expanding its footprint. In 2023, it announced a development agreement to open restaurants in the Middle East and accelerate its international expansion efforts.

Yum! Brands' Taco Bell called international its ""next growth engine"" at its investor day last month, with plans to increase international store count to more than 3,000 by 2030, from 1,153 in 2024.

But there could be a major speed bump ahead.

""If the governments in those countries start to view US brands more negatively, they can slow-roll their approval process. They can deny them in certain areas, make it much more difficult for US brands to grow,"" Saleh said.

He added that it's ""hard to assess"" when it'll be the case.

""There could be some ... call it guilt by association,"" Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace told Yahoo Finance. ""The appetite for certain US brands could be diminished as a result of what we're seeing play out on the global economic and trade front.""

He added, ""Take a look at what we're seeing with Elon Musk and Tesla, where people are ... openly protesting, people returning their Teslas."" He posed the question, ""Could we see something similar unfold with other well-known US brands in foreign markets?""

HOLMEN, Wis. (WFRV) – UPS is laying off dozens of employees in Wisconsin as it prepares to close one of its facilities in June.

According to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) letter submitted to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, the impacted facility is located in Holmen and will close permanently on June 10, 2025.

The closure will affect 42 workers, including 24 part-time package handlers and 18 full-time employees. UPS says it will try to minimize the impact by offering alternative roles where possible.

The layoffs will affect both union and non-union workers. Union employees, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, will have bumping rights—meaning senior workers can take positions from those with less seniority.

Health insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans have long faced scrutiny for allegedly improperly reporting patient diagnoses through a method known as “upcoding” that qualifies them for higher payments.
Significant coding differences between Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare were evident in diagnostic categories such as vascular disease, major depressive disorder and diabetes with chronic complications, the paper says.
The study analyzed data from nearly 700 Medicare Advantage contracts managed by nearly 200 health insurers.
The study notes that UnitedHealthcare is the Medicare Advantage market share leader, but concludes that doesn't account for its disproportionate benefit from coding intensity.","Medicare Advantage insurers pocketed more than $33 billion in extra payments in 2021 by using billing codes that portrayed members as unhealthy to generate additional revenue, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Tuesday.

UnitedHealth Group subsidiary UnitedHealthcare profited the most from its ""coding intensity"" strategy, collecting $13.9 billion, or 42%, of the total, followed by Humana with $6.3 billion, Elevance Health with $2.1 billion, CVS Health subsidiary Aetna with $2 billion and Kaiser Permanente subsidiary Kaiser Foundation Health Plan with $500 million, researchers from the University of California, San Diego, and Actuarial Research Corp. found.

Related: UnitedHealth must face Medicare Advantage upcoding trial: DOJ

Underlying those extra payments were higher risk scores under Medicare Advantage compared with fee-for-service Medicare, the researchers determined using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data.

The average risk score for Medicare Advantage members was 1.26 in 2021, while the risk score for people with traditional Medicare was 1.07, the study says. The average risk score for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage policyholders was 1.35.

“Differential coding resulted in an estimated increase in revenue of $1,863 per member at UnitedHealth, substantially greater than the industry average of $1,220 per member,” the paper says.

Health insurers operating Medicare Advantage plans have long faced scrutiny for allegedly improperly reporting patient diagnoses through a method known as “upcoding” that qualifies them for higher payments. The Justice Department is pursuing litigation against UnitedHealth Group over its coding practices and congressional leaders have demanded insurers turn over information on reporting protocols.

The researchers determined that diagnoses added during patient chart reviews and health risk assessments were main contributors to inflated payments. Significant coding differences between Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare were evident in diagnostic categories such as vascular disease, major depressive disorder and diabetes with chronic complications, the paper says.

The study analyzed data from nearly 700 Medicare Advantage contracts managed by nearly 200 health insurers. The authors acknowledge that demographics of plan members and patient health status may influence differences in risk scores, and potential under-coding in traditional Medicare may partially explain differences in coding practices.

The study notes that UnitedHealthcare is the Medicare Advantage market share leader, but concludes that doesn't account for its disproportionate benefit from coding intensity.

UnitedHealth Group rejected the study’s findings.

“This study is similar to others, relying on inaccurate assumptions and incomplete beneficiary information while ignoring the fact that Medicare Advantage serves an increasingly diverse, lower-income and clinically complex population,” UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. Humana, Elevance Health, CVS Health and Kaiser Permanente did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Better Medicare Alliance likewise criticized the findings. “It overlooks known under-coding in fee-for-service Medicare and does not adjust for clinical or demographic differences between Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, an essential step for fair comparison,” Kaitlyn Saal-Ridpath, vice president of policy and research, said in a statement. “Meanwhile, the underlying data is outdated and does not reflect recent risk-adjustment changes.”",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/medicare%20cards%20money%2024.png,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:27.723253

The healthcare behemoth is in the midst of a major transformation, streamlining operations and further expanding its diversified portfolio. The company is preparing to report results for the first three months of fiscal 2025.

Johnson & Johnson has hiked its dividend regularly over the past several years and currently offers a yield of 3.2%, which is well above the S&P 500 average. After a mixed performance last year, the stock entered 2025 on a positive note. However, the momentum waned in recent weeks and JNJ is currently trading at the levels seen 12 months ago.

Q1 Report on Tap

The first-quarter report is scheduled for release on April 15, at 6:20 am ET. On average, analysts following the business predict earnings of $2.6 per share and revenues of $21.6 billion for the March quarter. In the comparable quarter of 2024, the company earned $2.71 per share on revenues of $21.38 billion. Johnson & Johnson holds the distinction of consistently beating quarterly earnings estimates for over a decade. In the most recent quarter, revenue also topped expectations, marking the third beat in a row.

Last year, the company set aside around $50 billion for research and development and M&A, including the $14.6-billion deal to acquire Intracellular Therapies. Recently, it announced manufacturing, R&D, and technology investments of more than $55 billion in the US over the next four years. According to the management, earlier deals including the acquisition of Shockwave, V-Wave, and Ambrx enabled it to further shift the portfolio to address unmet needs in high-growth and high-innovation markets.

“Turning to 2025. And, as previously guided back at the end of 2023, we expect to deliver operational sales growth of 3% overcoming headwinds associated with US biosimilar entries for STELARA and the impact of the Part D redesign and continued macroeconomic pressures in China. Perhaps, even more impressive, we are planning for adjusted operational earnings per share growth of nearly 9%. I cannot think of any other company that would be able to deliver growth through the first year of losing exclusivity of a multibillion-dollar product,” the company’s CEO Joaquin Duato said in the Q4 earnings call.

The drugmaker expects acquisitions and divestitures to favorably impact operational growth by about 50 basis points in FY25. The management maintains a positive outlook, despite anticipating headwinds from the sales slowdown in China and biosimilar competition for one of its lead products – for blockbuster drug Stelara, biosimilars have been approved and are expected to be launched in the US and Europe soon.

Mixed Q4

In the December quarter, net earnings decreased 17% year-over-year to $3.4 billion or $1.41 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share decreased 11% to $2.04.

Menchaca,,,,,https://investorsobserver.com/stocks/rare-tariff-winner-heres-how-levis-plans-to-work-around-trumps-trade-war/,"Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) beat expectations in the first quarter, delivering stronger-than-expected profits and expressing rare confidence in the face of Trump’s new tariffs.
Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million from Dockers, which has been reclassified as a discontinued operation.
Trump's tariffs had no effect on Levi's guidance Despite economic uncertainty and fresh U.S. tariffs, Levi’s is sticking with its full-year guidance.
“We’re trying to put in place a mitigation plan where the impact to the consumer is minimal,” Singh said.
“In our experience, the U.S. consumer gravitates to brands they can trust during times like these.”","Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) beat expectations in the first quarter, delivering stronger-than-expected profits and expressing rare confidence in the face of Trump’s new tariffs.

The denim giant reported a profit of $135 million for the quarter ended March 2, a sharp turnaround from a $10.6 million loss in the same period last year.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at 38 cents, crushing Wall Street's estimate of 28 cents, according to FactSet.

Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million from Dockers, which has been reclassified as a discontinued operation.

The increase was driven largely by a 6% gain in Levi’s core Americas region. Direct-to-consumer sales surged 9%, while wholesale revenue slipped 3%.

“The Levi’s brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the center of culture across the globe,” said CEO Michelle Gass.

Analysts had projected revenue of $1.54 billion. Shares jumped 4.8% to $14.15 in after-hours trading Monday.

Trump's tariffs had no effect on Levi's guidance

Despite economic uncertainty and fresh U.S. tariffs, Levi’s is sticking with its full-year guidance.

Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh told investors most of Levi’s spring and early summer inventory has already arrived in the U.S., softening the tariff impact for the current quarter.

“We’re trying to put in place a mitigation plan where the impact to the consumer is minimal,” Singh said. “The tariffs have just happened, and so it’s a 24/7 job for the company.”

According to The Wall Street Journal, Levi’s has already formed a team to assess the implications of former President Trump's new tariffs.

Looking ahead, Singh said Levi’s expects “minimal impact” on second-quarter margins. He added that the company’s strong balance sheet and global footprint position it well to manage any disruptions.

Levi’s 2025 forecast excludes potential fallout from macroeconomic shocks, inflation, supply chain issues, and retaliatory tariffs.

The company sources its products from around 30 countries, with no more than 30% coming from any single nation. Fewer than 1% of its U.S.-sold products are made in China.

“It’s early days, but we’ve seen the consumer remain generally resilient,” Singh said. “In our experience, the U.S. consumer gravitates to brands they can trust during times like these.”",https://media.investorsobserver.com/images/featured-big/2025/04/levis-stock.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 20:05:17.592241

Levi's sees growth potential amid new tariff environment

Shares of Levi Strauss (NYSE: LEVI) rose Tuesday but swiftly came back to earth a day after the San Francisco-based denim giant reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit and gave a relatively optimistic outlook on the Trump administration's new tariffs. After the bell Monday, Levi's reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, above the $0.28 consensus forecast of analysts. The company also generated $1.53 billion in revenue, in line with estimates. Bloomberg reports that Levi's said its guidance for fiscal 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply-chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors. Levi also sees organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% this year. Shares rose as much as 16% — the biggest gain in a year — but that quickly evaporated Tuesday morning, later hovering around 1% above where it started the day. Overall, Levi's stock is still down more than 16% over the past five days.

East Bay casino gets approval to expand

The owner of a cardroom located along Interstate 580 in Livermore can expand and raise the gambling establishment’s betting limit, a move city leaders say will bring in more tax revenue, the Bay Area News Group reports. The Livermore City Council’s unanimous approval allows the Parkwest 580 Casino to add six card tables to its 10 existing ones and increase the betting limit from $200 to $1,000. Officials expect to quadruple the city’s take, from $1,890 to $4,800 per table a month — or an extra $695,000 a year. The city’s only other venue is Livermore Casino, which currently has 10 tables.

In its annual report regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, Kroger reported that it spent $684 million in 2024 on “merger related costs,” which included “third-party professional fees (outside experts, such as lawyers) and credit facility fees (borrowing costs).” The failed merger, which was originally announced in October 2022, cost Kroger $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report.

Albertsons contends that it was steadfastly committed to completing the merger, stating that “Kroger’s weak claims are a deliberate tactic to distract from its own ongoing executive leadership issues; blatant and recurring failures to carry out its contractual obligations under the merger agreement; and avoid paying the damages it owes to Albertsons.”",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2024-12/kroger-albertsons_teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:04:06.805620

According to a court filing released Monday, the sale, scheduled for April 23 in New York, marks the latest chapter in Redbox’s dramatic collapse, which saw the company go from a billion-dollar business to bankruptcy in less than a decade, as reported by FastCompany.

The auction comes nearly a year after Redbox filed for bankruptcy in June 2024, a downfall accelerated by the pandemic’s shift to streaming and compounded by alleged mismanagement. The filing details a fire sale of intellectual property, including Redbox and Crackle trademarks, patents, and rights to hundreds of films and TV shows from Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment’s Screen Media Films subsidiary. Titles up for grabs range from cult classics like Jeepers Creepers to quirky Nicolas Cage starrer Willy’s Wonderland. While exact valuations remain uncertain, earlier filings suggest interest in the film catalogs has topped $100 million.

This comes as Crackle recently started to work again, as first reported by Cord Cutters News.

Notably absent from the sale are Redbox’s iconic red kiosks, once numbering 27,000 outside stores like CVS and Albertsons. Many have already been junked or sold for parts on eBay after retailers, fed up with unpaid fees and power bills—like Albertsons’ $184,000 monthly tab—won court approval to dispose of them. The filing doesn’t specify why the remaining machines aren’t included, but their fate seems sealed.

Redbox’s demise is a tale of missed opportunities and corporate chaos. At its peak in 2018, the company raked in over $1 billion, banking on a streaming pivot that never materialized. The pandemic slashed its revenue to $250 million by 2021, and a 2022 acquisition by Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment for $375 million—laden with $325 million in debt—only deepened the hole. The parent company’s rosy forecasts of a DVD rental rebound proved “wildly unrealistic,” per the bankruptcy trustee, who last month sued former executives and board members, alleging they treated the firm as a “personal piggy bank” through exorbitant fees to the Chicken Soup book publisher.

The lawsuit claims these fees, peaking at $18.4 million annually post-acquisition, drained Redbox even as it couldn’t afford DVDs or employee health insurance. By early 2024, cash was so scarce that technicians couldn’t fuel company vehicles. The trustee aims to claw back these funds, with proceeds—along with auction earnings—likely funneling to primary lender HPS, owed $500 million.

Newman will replace Thomas Cowhey, who has held the role since January 2024.

Newman will assume the position on April 21. Cowhey will transition to a strategic advisor role to CVS Health President and CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

CVS also announced the appointment of Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips as executive vice president and chief medical officer, starting May 19. She replaces Dr. Sreekanth Chaguturu, who was promoted in November to executive vice president and president of Health Care Delivery for CVS Health.

The leadership changes are part of an ongoing executive restructuring led by Joyner, who was named CEO of the company in October 2024 as CVS works to rebound from a challenging financial year.

Despite the shakeup, CVS said it expects to “meet or exceed” its previously issued financial guidance for 2025. In February, the company reported projected cash flow from operations of approximately $6.5 billion for the full year. CVS said total revenue rose 4.2% to $97.7 billion during the fourth quarter.

The company had missed earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024 and withdrew its annual forecast in October.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” Joyner said in a statement. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.”

Joyner also praised Cowhey’s leadership, noting he “stepped up during a challenging year and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities.”

Newman most recently served as executive vice president and CFO at United Parcel Service. Before that, he spent 26 years in executive roles at PepsiCo.

Compton-Phillips was most recently chief physician executive at healthcare performance improvement company Press Ganey. A board-certified internist, she previously held leadership roles at Providence Health & Services and Kaiser Permanente.

Clifford rejoined The Children’s Place from Vineyard Vines, where she most recently served as senior vice president of sourcing.","The Children’s Place is making some changes to its executive leadership team.

The Secaucus-based children’s retailer recently added John Szczepanski as chief financial officer. In his new position, Szczepanski oversees finance, accounting, financial planning & analysis, tax, treasury, procurement, investor relations, internal audit and real estate, the company said.

Prior to his March 31 start at The Children’s Place, Szczepanski was CFO at Vince Holding Corp., a global retail company headquartered in New York City. His background also includes more than 18 years in various roles at luxury fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Szczepanski succeeds interim CFO and chief accounting officer Laura Lentini, who stepped in after Sheamus Toal left the company in December 2024.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the time, The Children’s Place said the decision to part ways was not the result of any disagreement. Toal began in October 2022 as chief financial officer and senior vice president. In August 2023, he also took on the role of chief operating officer.

“Today marks an exciting new chapter for our company as we welcome John to be our CFO,” said Muhammad Umair, who was named interim CEO in May 2024 following the departure of longtime CEO Jane Elfers.

“During this critical time in our planning and implementation of new business strategies, John brings a wealth of finance experience in retail and manufacturing that will help guide us through our company’s future development,” he said. We are delighted to have him join our team as we continue to build strong and efficient business operations and drive a financial strategy that can lay the groundwork for the company’s long-term success.”

Other team changes

The Children’s Place – whose brands include Gymboree, Sugar & Jade and PJ Place – has been busy trying to turn its business around. After warning of liquidity concerns in February 2024, the retailer saw a change in control when Mithaq Capital became its majority shareholder.

As part of a strategy shift, the company has made changes across its leadership teams as it looks to cut costs and pay down debt.

Like many other specialty retailers, The Children’s Place has evolved its brick-and-mortar approach amid the rise of e-commerce. As part of a shift from the traditional store concept into a digital-first business, it permanently closed more than 700 locations in the past decade. The company’s footprint now stands at roughly 500 stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.

The Children’s Place also made two other leadership appointments recently: Kristin Clifford as senior vice president, head of sourcing; and Smeeta Khetarpaul, senior vice president, head of marketing.

Both report to Claudia Lima-Guinehut, brand president of The Children’s Place.

Clifford rejoined The Children’s Place from Vineyard Vines, where she most recently served as senior vice president of sourcing. Before that, she was vice president of global sourcing at The Children’s Place until 2020.

Khetarpaul arrived from Crocs Inc., where she was a vice president of marketing for North America and Brazil. She brings over two decades of marketing experience with beauty, consumer products and retail brands.

The Indian brand improved its average score by one point for 2025, reaching an average ILE score of 56.
Higher rate of phone response: Compared to the industry overall, Indian dealers maintain an eight-point lead in the rate of phone response to customer inquiries, occurring 58% of the time on average.
The overall powersports industry average ILE score remained the same over the last year, both with ILE scores of 44.
There are two different key areas of improvement for powersports dealers, depending on their current performance levels.","Polaris Inc.’s Indian Motorcycle dealerships ranked highest in the 2025 Pied Piper PSI Internet Lead Effectiveness (ILE) Powersports Industry Study, measuring dealer response to internet sales leads coming through dealership websites. Following Indian were Harley-Davidson, BMW, and BRP’s Can-Am Off-Road dealers.

Pied Piper submitted customer inquiries through 2,523 powersports dealership websites representing 27 brands. Each inquiry asked a specific question about a vehicle in inventory and included a new customer name, email address and local telephone number. Pied Piper then evaluated the speed and quality of dealership responses by email, telephone, text message and chat over the next 24 hours. Each brand’s overall ILE Score is a combined average of their individual dealer ILE performances. ILE evaluations consist of over 20 differently weighted measurements, based upon best practices that are mathematically most likely to generate sales, combining into an overall ILE score ranging from 0 to 100.

Indian Ranked Highest for 3rd Consecutive Year: What Sets It Apart?

2025 marks the third year in a row the Indian brand achieved the top score in the annual ILE powersports industry study. The Indian brand improved its average score by one point for 2025, reaching an average ILE score of 56.

Answering customers’ questions more often: Indian dealers this year answered their customers’ questions by email/text 67% of the time on average, improving six points over last year and 17 points higher than the 2025 industry average.

Higher rate of phone response: Compared to the industry overall, Indian dealers maintain an eight-point lead in the rate of phone response to customer inquiries, occurring 58% of the time on average.

“Did both” for more inquiries: Indian dealers “did both” (answering an inquiry by email/text and also phoning, improving the odds of a response reaching the customer) 46% of the time on average, eight points higher than last year and 20 points higher than the industry average.

“The Indian motorcycle brand has maintained industry leading web-response behaviors during a challenging time in the powersports industry,” said Cameron O’Hagan, Pied Piper’s vice president of metrics and analytics. “Two years ago, when market conditions were more favorable, dealers could easily afford to expand their staff and refine operations. Today, however, tougher conditions have many dealers battling just to keep the lights on.”

How Did the Industry Perform Over the Past Year?

The overall powersports industry average ILE score remained the same over the last year, both with ILE scores of 44. Powersports dealers in 2025 improved phone behaviors and rate of response, but also experienced declines in other important areas, resulting in no overall change in total ILE Score

Behaviors That Improved

Powersports dealers in 2025 performed better in phone and text response, and the rate of dealers failing to respond occurred less often:

More phone response: Dealers this year were five points more likely to respond to online customer inquiries by phone, occurring 50% of the time on average.

Better use of texting: Customers were more likely to receive a text response answering their question, increasing five points to an overall rate this year of 30%.

Fewer failures to respond: Dealers failed to respond to online inquiries less often this year, occurring only 9% of the time on average.

Behaviors in Decline

There were two notable declines in behavior that held back overall industry score improvement:

Fewer emails answering questions: Dealers answered customers’ questions by email 27% of the time on average in 2025, down from 35% last year.

Not offering appointments as often: Only 10% of customers in 2025 received a response that included an offer to set up an appointment, in contrast to last year where it occurred 13% of the time on average.

What is the ’80/40 Rule’ and How Does it Relate to the Powersports Industry?

In the 2025 powersports industry study, 13% of all dealerships measured scored above 80 (providing quick and thorough personal responses), while 42% of dealerships scored below 40 (failing to personally respond to website customers). The “over 80” and “under 40” segments each shrank by 1% since last year, with a larger pool of dealers performing in the space between both categories.

“The effort to improve from the under 40 bucket into the over 80 is worth it,” said O’Hagan. “Historically, we have found that dealers who improve their ILE performance from scoring under 40 to scoring over 80 on average sell 50% more units from the same quantity of website customer leads.”

What is the Powersports Industry’s Greatest Opportunity for Improvement?

There are two different key areas of improvement for powersports dealers, depending on their current performance levels. One in four powersports dealerships currently fail to personally respond to website customer inquiries. For this group of dealers, the sole focus should be a commitment to always personally respond to online customers at least once each day.

“Just as you wouldn’t lock up at the end of the day with a physical customer still wandering around the showroom, don’t leave your digital customers hanging overnight in your digital showroom waiting for your reply,” said O’Hagan.

For the rest of the dealers, the step with the greatest opportunity is to embrace a reliable multi-channel communication strategy, rather than responding to customers using only email, only phone or only text. In this year’s study, powersports dealers failed to use multiple paths 74% of time, leaving many of their responses susceptible to communication breakdowns beyond the dealer’s control.

“Emails can land in spam/junk and be missed, customers often ignore calls from an unknown number and don’t listen to voicemail, and even texts can be lost or ignored among the large volume of messages many people receive per day,” said O’Hagan. “A consistent multi-pronged response to every customer is critical since you never know in advance which communication method will be most effective at reaching a specific customer. Then, once contact is established, adopt the successful method for future interactions with the customer.”

2025 Brand Performance Compared

Response to customer web inquiries within a 24-hour period in 2025 had large variations by brand, as shown by these examples:

“Answered Question”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question?

More than 65% of the time on average: BMW, Moto Guzzi, Indian, Ducati

Less than 35% of the time on average: Roxor, Kymco, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops)

“Phoned Customer”: How often did the brand’s dealerships respond by phone to a website customer’s inquiry?

More than 50% of the time on average: Harley-Davidson, Indian, Honda, Can-Am

Less than 30% of the time on average: Arctic Cat, Roxor, Moto Guzzi, Cub Cadet

“Offered an Appointment”: How often did the brand’s dealerships offer to set an appointment for specific date/time?

More than 15% of the time on average: Can-Am, Indian, Polaris, Segway

Less than 1% of the time on average: John Deere, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops), Cub Cadet

“Did at Least One”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question and/or respond by phone?

More than 80% of the time on average: BMW, KTM, Moto Guzzi, Harley-Davidson

Less than 50% of the time on average: Roxor, Cub Cadet

“Did Both”: How often did the brand’s dealerships email or text an answer to a website customer’s question and also phone the customer?

More than 30% of the time on average: Indian, Harley-Davidson, Triumph

Less than 10% of the time on average: Kymco, Tracker (Bass Pro Shops), Cub Cadet

Why Was This Study Conducted?

“Customers today visit dealer websites first, and how dealers respond to those customers drives today’s sales success,” said O’Hagan. “The trouble is that website customers can be invisible in day-to-day operations which makes them too easy to overlook.”

LEVI’s Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

DTC net revenues reflected an increase of 9% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic basis to $787.5 million. Organic DTC growth was backed by a rise of 8% in the United States, 11% in Europe and 14% in Asia. E-commerce net revenues were up 13% on a reported basis and 16% on an organic basis. In the fiscal first quarter, DTC accounted for 52% of the overall net revenues.

Wholesale net revenues dipped 3% on a reported basis to $739.3 million. The metric rose 5% on an organic basis. Beyond Yoga revenues grew 10% on both reported and organic basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DTC and Wholesale channels is pegged at $794 million and $749 million, respectively, for the fiscal first quarter.

In the Americas, revenues increased 6% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis, backed

by double-digit growth in both DTC and wholesale channels. Within the Americas, revenues in the United States rose 8% on an organic basis, fueled by the high single-digit increase in both channels. In Mexico, revenues were up 6% on higher traffic in the stores and e-commerce growth. In Europe, revenues fell 5% on a reported basis but rose 3% on an organic basis.

In Asia, revenues were up 7% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic basis. DTC revenues rose 14%, driven by double-digit growth in the major markets such as Japan, Korea and Turkey. The company’s business in South Asia, the Middle-East and Africa, including India, grew double-digits on better in-store retail experiences, improved conversion rates and growth in wholesale units. Its business in China was flat year over year and management anticipates modest expectations in the current fiscal year as progress to reset this market is ongoing.

LEVI’s Margins & Expenses

The gross profit increased 8.9% year over year to $947.6 million. The gross margin expanded 330 basis points (bps) to 62.1% in the fiscal first quarter. This growth was primarily buoyed by lower product costs, including savings from Project Fuel initiatives, a favorable channel mix and brand mix.

Operating margin was 12.5%, up from 0.04% in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBIT margin jumped 400 bps to 13.4% compared with 9.4% in the last year, driven by gross margin expansion.

Adjusted SG&A edged up 1.7% to $744 million, reflecting increased distribution expenses. However, as a percentage of revenues, adjusted SG&A leveraged 70 bps to 48.7%.

Levi’s Other Financial Snapshots

Levi’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $574.4 million and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. As of March 2, 2025, long-term debt and total shareholders’ equity were $987.4 million and $2.03 billion, respectively. Total inventories jumped 7% on a dollar basis.

In first-quarter fiscal 2025, net cash generated from operating activities was $52.5 million and adjusted free cash flow was $14.1 million.

In the fiscal first quarter, the company returned nearly $81 million to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, up 12% year over year. This included dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of 13 cents per share and approximately $30 million in share repurchases, retiring 1.6 million shares. At the quarter end, LEVI had $560 million remaining in its existing share repurchase authorization, with no expiration date.

Management has announced a cash dividend of 13 cents per share, totaling roughly $51 million. This is payable on May 9 to its shareholders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of April 24, 2025.

What to Expect From LEVI in FY25?

The outlook for fiscal 2025 is based on the continuing operations, with the Dockers business now reported as discontinued operations. We note that the company’s guidance for the current fiscal year is unchanged except to reflect the Dockers business in discontinued operations. Management is prudent with respect to the global wholesale and anticipates the channel to be flat in fiscal 2025 on an organic basis. International growth is also a significant opportunity for the company.

LEVI’s fiscal second-quarter guidance remains consistent with its internal plan. The fiscal second quarter is seasonally the company’s lowest quarter for revenues and margins in the year. The tariff impact is likely to have a minimal impact on the margin structure in the impending quarter. For the fiscal second quarter, it projects organic net revenue growth from continued operations of 3.5-4.5%, excluding nearly 2 points of foreign exchange headwinds and 1.5 points related to the exit of Denizen and footwear business.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 bps and 100 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin is likely to be in the band of 5.5-6%. Adjusted EPS is envisioned to be 11-13 cents, reflecting about 3 cents of headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate year over year.

Considering such expectation, the company’s profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, approximately 20% compared with the first half of fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2025, reported net revenues are still expected to decline 1-2%, while organic net revenues are anticipated to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. Gross margin is now predicted to expand 100 bps to 61.6%. Adjusted EBIT margin is now anticipated to expand to 11.4-11.6%, up from 10.9-11.1% guided earlier. This shows an expansion of 70-90 bps from a 10% base. It expects a tax rate of about 23%. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the band of $1.20 to $1.25, incorporating an estimated 20-cent impact of foreign exchange and a higher tax rate.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 14.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 30.4%.

Now in its sixth year and fifth growing season, the company, founded by Purdue graduate Kyle Albertson, uses drones to provide crop health mapping, pesticide spraying, and insect control, doubling its coverage each year. With a goal of managing 10,000 acres in the upcoming season, Albertson Drone Service highlights the growing role of Drone Technology in modern farming.

Drone Capabilities and Specs

Albertson Drone Service’s drones can spray 30 to 40 acres per hour, a significant improvement over traditional methods. While specific drone models weren’t disclosed in the Inside Indiana Business report, agricultural drones in this category, such as the DJI Agras T40, typically offer a flight time of 10-15 minutes per battery cycle when fully loaded, a range of 1.2 miles (line-of-sight), and a payload capacity of 88 lbs (40 liters) for liquid pesticides.

These drones use GPS and automated flight paths to ensure precision, avoiding obstacles like trees and power lines—challenges Albertson noted as non-issues for his operations. For exact specs on the Agras T40, refer to DJI’s official product page. Albertson’s ability to cover hard-to-reach field edges adds roughly 20 acres per field that traditional equipment might miss, enhancing overall yield potential.

Market Context and Competition

The agricultural drone market is expanding rapidly, driven by the need for precision farming. Companies like DroneDeploy and PrecisionHawk offer similar services, focusing on data analytics for crop health, while XAG and Yamaha provide competing spraying drones. Albertson Drone Service stands out in Indiana as the first licensed operator, giving it a regional edge. However, larger players with broader service portfolios and established client bases pose a challenge. The global agricultural drone market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 31.4% from 2023 to 2030, per industry reports, signaling fierce competition as more entrants adopt drone technology.

Regulatory Compliance

Operating agricultural drones for spraying requires strict adherence to FAA regulations. Albertson spent time in the FAA and 4-H programs before launching his business, ensuring compliance with Part 137 certification for aerial application and Part 107 for commercial drone operations. These certifications mandate pilot licensing, equipment registration, and adherence to airspace restrictions. Indiana’s regulatory environment supports such innovation, but operators must also comply with state pesticide application laws, which Albertson’s licensing covers.

Infrastructure Impact

Drones reduce the need for heavy machinery in fields, minimizing soil compaction—a common issue with traditional tractors like the John Deere model shown in the Inside Indiana Business feature. This allows for more sustainable farming practices, especially in Benton County’s corn and soybean fields. However, drone operations require charging stations, battery management, and pesticide refilling infrastructure, which Albertson likely manages from a mobile base. Scaling to 10,000 acres will demand robust logistics, including additional drones and trained pilots, which the company plans to address by hiring two Purdue interns this summer.

Industry Implications

Albertson Drone Service’s success underscores the potential of drones to address labor shortages and rising costs in agriculture. By covering 30-40 acres per hour, drones offer a faster, more precise alternative to manual spraying, reducing pesticide waste and environmental impact. This efficiency is critical as farmers face pressure to increase yields amid climate challenges. The company’s growth also highlights the role of ag-tech Education—Albertson’s Purdue background gave him a head start, and his internship program could inspire a new generation of ag-tech innovators.

Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Albertson Drone Service aims to double its 2024 coverage to 10,000 acres, a goal that will test its operational capacity. Advances in drone technology, such as longer flight times and higher payloads, could further boost efficiency. However, regulatory hurdles, like potential changes to FAA rules or pesticide restrictions, may pose challenges. As the ag-tech sector evolves, Albertson’s focus on local expertise and sustainable practices positions it well to lead in Indiana’s farming landscape, potentially setting a model for other regions to follow.

“If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.” Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp.
But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.","NEW YORK — Economy Candy’s shelves brim with sweets from around the world – gummies from Germany, lollipops from Spain, chocolates from Japan and a panoply of candies from across the U.S.

Standing amid it all, columns of bright jellybeans to his left and exotic Kit Kats to his right, owner Mitchell Cohen is quick with his assessment of how many of this shop’s 2,000-plus items are affected by the historic round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.

“I think all of them,” Cohen says at his store on New York's Lower East Side.

Few corners of the American economy are untouched, directly or indirectly, by the sweeping tariffs being imposed by Trump. Even a little store like Economy Candy.

Cohen had just begun to feel a barrage of inflation-driven price increases from suppliers ease when the tariff threats arrived. For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.

“I think it’s gonna be another round of this hyperinflation on some items,” says 39-year-old Cohen. “If we’re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.”

Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp. Its name is emblazoned on a sign in a vintage, blaring red script, and crossing below its green-and-white striped awning, past the bins of Smarties, butterscotches and Lemonheads in the front window, an indecipherable sweetness fills the air, oldies music sounds overhead and customers mill around stacks of candy bars they forgot still existed.

It represents just a blip in the country’s $54 billion candy industry. But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.

Candy and gum prices are up about 34% from five years ago and 89% from 2005, according to Consumer Price Index data. Price, according to the National Confectioners Association, has become the top factor in consumers’ candy purchase decisions, outweighing a buyer's mood.

About a third of Economy Candy’s products are imported, crowded on shelves and tables near the store’s rear. There aren’t just “more German Haribo varieties than the Haribo store in Germany,” as Cohen claims, but gummies the brand makes in France, Austria and Britain.

They have every Milka bar they can find in Switzerland, every type of Leone hard candies that Italy churns out and as many exotic Kit Kats from Japan as they can fit.

On products like these, the tariffs’ toll is obvious.

Pistachio Snickers bars are from India, now subject to 26% tariffs, while passion fruit mousse Snickers are from Portugal, now under the 20% European Union levies.

But even an American-made Snickers isn’t immune.

While the bars may roll off conveyors in Texas, they rely on ingredients from around the globe. Sourcemap, which tracks supply chains, says Snickers bars include chocolate from Guyana and sugar from Brazil and are wrapped in packaging from Canada. All are now subjected to varying levels of tariffs.

“There’s a lot of ingredients in there that have to come from other countries,” says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade. “Unless you’re talking about something very simple from your local farmers market, almost every product relies on ingredients from elsewhere. Those indirect costs are really what’s going to drive up prices.”

The story repeats with American candies across the store – the boxes of Nerds and bags of Sugar Babies and rolls of Smarties are all inextricably tied to the global supply chain.

A table teeming with those domestic delicacies takes center stage near Economy Candy’s entrance. Cohen took over the store from his parents, who took it over from their parents before. He got his first haircut in the store. He was behind the register as a child. He took his wife by on their first date.

As a kid, everything on the store’s centerpiece table of American treats cost 59 cents. By 2020, the price was $1.29, but customers who bought a whole box paid a discounted rate of $1 per piece.

Now, Cohen can’t even get them wholesale at that price.

Today, he sells the items on the table for $1.59. Cohen calls the selection a “loss leader” but thinks it's important to showcase his store's affordability. Once the tariffs are fully implemented, he’s not sure he’ll be able to put off price increases.

“When your margins are coming down and your dollar doesn’t go as far at the end of the day, you really start to feel it,” he says. “But I don’t want anyone to come into Economy Candy and not think that it’s economical.”

The biggest-ticket implications of the tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention – the thousands of dollars a car’s price tag may grow, the tens of thousands that disappear from a retirement account in a single day. But here among the root beer barrels and licorice strands, you're reminded that small-dollar items are affected too, and so are the families selling them.

At its birth, the business Cohen’s grandfather started focused on shoe and hat repairs. But in the wake of the Great Depression, when few in a neighborhood of crowded tenements had money for such fixes, the business pivoted.

Candy, once relegated to a cart out front, took over the store.

In the 88 years since, business hasn't always been Chuckles and Zagnuts. The Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away and had sales sagging and the pandemic closed the store and forced it to pivot to online sales.

If tariffs upend things, Cohen isn’t sure how he might adapt again. He sells products that aren’t made in America and he sells American products made with ingredients from across the globe. He had just been making headway on beginning international sales, but the web of tariff rules may make it impossible.

On April 8, McDonald’s announced that starting today, lemonade is rolling out as a permanent menu item at participating restaurants nationwide.

If you’re thinking to yourself, “I thought McDonald’s already had lemonade,” you’d be correct — its restaurant has served Minute Maid lemonade for years. This is not that.

The chain said on its menu spotter that it’s “serving up some citrus-ly good flavors” with the new lemonade, which features lemon juice, lemon pulp and cane sugar.

McDonald’s says its lemonade became a fan-favorite after it was tested in select local markets beginning in March 2023.

Over a year ago, McDonald’s workers discussed the new drink offering — and how it’s different from Minute Maid’s lemonade — on Reddit.

“What is the difference between premium lemonade and regular lemonade?” wrote the original poster, along with an image of instructions on how to serve the new drink.

“I think the premium one has pulp and is trying to be ‘freshly squeezed,’” replied one Reddit user.

“About seven letters and a space,” wrote another.

It should be noted that McDonald’s hasn’t completely broken up with Minute Maid, as it still has the brand’s orange juice on its menu.

Taking the ingredients of both the chain’s old and new lemonade offering into consideration reveals a few interesting tidbits.

Travis Knight is the son of Phil Knight, the man who revolutionized the sportswear industry through Nike. Travis is carving out his own legacy as the President and CEO of Laika the award-winning stop-motion animation studio.

Did Phil Knight Found Laika?

No, Phil Knight did not found Laika. However, he played a significant role in the company’s establishment. In 1998, Phil Knight and Travis Knight (then a 25-year-old animator) helped finance Laika as it was born out of a predecessor company, Will Vinton Studios. Travis Knight eventually took the reins at Laika and led it to international acclaim, particularly with films like Coraline, ParaNorman, and Kubo and the Two Strings.

Who Owns Laika?

Laika is owned by the Knight family, with Phil Knight being the primary shareholder. However, Travis Knight holds a prominent role in the company as its CEO and President, making strategic decisions and overseeing the creative direction of the studio. The family’s involvement in Laika reflects their commitment to supporting the creative arts and expanding their influence beyond the world of sports.

Is Laika Owned by Nike?

Despite the Knight family’s connection to Nike, Laika is not owned by Nike. While Phil Knight's wealth from Nike helped fund Laika’s early stages, the two companies operate independently. Laika’s focus is on creating exceptional stop-motion animated films, a world apart from the sportswear industry that Nike dominates. The collaboration between the two entities comes through the Knight family’s influence, but they remain separate, with Laika making its mark in Hollywood.

Laika’s Creative and Financial Success

Under Travis Knight’s leadership, Laika has earned a reputation for producing critically acclaimed animated films that push the boundaries of stop-motion animation. The company has enjoyed both financial success and industry recognition, with several of its films earning Academy Award nominations. Laika’s turnover has varied by year, depending on the success of its films, but it remains a well-funded, privately held company supported by the Knight family’s financial backing.

More About Travis Knight

Before becoming CEO of Laika, Travis Knight was an accomplished animator and the lead animator on several of Laika’s early films. His directorial debut, Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), received critical praise and an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature. His involvement with Laika has been instrumental in shaping the studio’s distinctive style and creative direction.

Today, Travis Knight continues to build on his father’s legacy, proving that creativity and business acumen can come together to forge a unique path in the entertainment industry.

Conclusion

Travis Knight has undeniably built Laika into the powerhouse it is today, delivering innovative, critically acclaimed films that have redefined stop-motion animation. However, it’s impossible to ignore the fact that his success didn’t come in isolation. The Knight family name alone gave Travis a major leg up, with Phil Knight’s wealth and support providing crucial early-stage backing. While Travis’s creative vision and leadership have certainly driven the studio forward, the financial foundation and network afforded by his father’s legacy undeniably played a role in Laika’s ascent.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:31.236138

And the first place they'll feel it is in parts of the store where the inventory has to move fast.
Grocery stores sell a lot of shrimp from Vietnam, which President Donald Trump hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff, and India, with a 26% tariff.
Specialty coffee beans might eventually cost consumers 10% to 35% more than before the tariffs, bean buyers predicted.
Since the pandemic, grocery stores have been expanding their lines of lower-priced private-label products.","Grocery shoppers are likely to feel the impact of the Trump administration's sweeping new tariffs before April is over. And the first place they'll feel it is in parts of the store where the inventory has to move fast.

In the produce aisle, food analysts said Thursday, expect small price increases on everyday purchases like bananas from Guatemala and grapes from Peru, countries whose exports to the United States will incur 10% tariffs with the new fees, which went into effect April 5. A separate round of reciprocal tariffs on 57 countries will follow April 9.

The seafood counter may hold even worse surprises. Grocery stores sell a lot of shrimp from Vietnam, which President Donald Trump hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff, and India, with a 26% tariff.

Soon, analysts say, price hikes will arrive for staples like sugar and coffee, which is already priced at a historic high. Specialty coffee beans might eventually cost consumers 10% to 35% more than before the tariffs, bean buyers predicted.

Since the pandemic, grocery stores have been expanding their lines of lower-priced private-label products. Customers loved them as a way to navigate inflation, but tariffs will drive up costs.

""It was a bit of a refuge for consumers,"" said Keith Daniels, a managing partner at investment bank Carl Marks Advisors, who focuses on the food and grocery sectors. ""Now that's not going to be there.""

Still, he and some food executives said that because so much food on shelves in the United States is processed overseas or contains ingredients and packaging from several countries, predicting how tariffs will change food prices is difficult, if not impossible.

Some of the cost of the tariffs is likely to be absorbed and not passed on to consumers, as retailers reevaluate pricing strategies and determine how long the inventory they already have in the country might last.

Still, the opportunity for price gouging or other forms of manipulation are high, said Errol Schweizer, a veteran of the grocery industry who publishes The Checkout Grocery Update, a newsletter.

""Consumers won't know if things are priced correctly or they are getting ripped off,"" he said.

At all levels of the food business, just figuring out the additional paperwork will take time. Walmart requires suppliers to give advance notice of price increases and clear documentation for them. But some businesses have yet to set up systems for recording and paying tariffs.

""It will take a year for all those costs to ripple through, but in 12 months you will absolutely see higher prices across the board,"" said Jeff Dunn, executive chair of Generous Brands and Bolthouse Fresh Foods.

Big food producers like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz are better equipped to absorb the impact of tariffs than smaller companies with relatively thin operating margins are. For those smaller players, staying afloat with the new tariffs will likely involve some fast, creative and strategic cost-cutting.

Last week, Paleovalley, a Colorado company that makes meat sticks and other products, was scrambling to mitigate the potential impact of the tariffs on imported monkfruit puree, an ingredient that is hard to source.

Ethan Frisch is the co-founder and co-CEO of Burlap & Barrel, which imports spices from 30 countries and buys exclusively from small producers. It has a shipment of cinnamon already coming on a ship from Vietnam. The farmers and the shipping company have all been paid. He has no idea if he will have to pay a tariff.

Because of uncertainties like that, he has decided to scale back on other goods the company was planning to introduce later in the year, like an Advent calendar filled with spice samples from around the world tucked into festive packaging manufactured in China.

Yun Hai, a specialty food shop in New York City, buys directly from rice farms, soy sauce breweries and mills in Taiwan, then ships the goods over in bulk, supplying grocery stores and restaurants across the country. The new tariff on those foods, most of which have no local substitute, is 32%.

""We're on the front line because we're the importer,"" said the company's CEO, Lisa Cheng Smith, whose most recent shipment of goods arrived a day before the tariffs were announced. She plans to examine creative ways to reduce other costs by 32% without losing her business.

""We're not going to panic and just raise our prices right away,"" she said.

In the meantime, it might not be a bad idea to stock up, said Sam Silverstein, a reporter for trade publication Grocery Dive.

""It's harder to stockpile avocados than cans of soup,"" he said, ""which is another reason to grab something on the shelf if it's offered at a good price.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/103611920_209568732-aeaaa5cf38364618a_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:13.236096

Prior to that, she spent almost a decade on Novartis’ sales and marketing team, culminating in a stint leading the evolution of the U.S. oncology customer model.

In a LinkedIn post last week, Chaudhuri shared several photos to commemorate her “incredible journey at Johnson & Johnson” and to celebrate her colleagues and their shared accomplishments.

“I am incredibly proud of what we achieved together,” she wrote, adding, “At the end of the day, success is about more than just the science—it’s about the people who make innovation possible. I will carry forward the experiences, leadership lessons, and deep sense of purpose that I have gained here as I step into my next chapter.”

Chaudhuri is joining Rocket as it inches closer to a potential U.S. approval for Kresladi, a gene therapy to treat severe leukocyte adhesion deficiency-I.

Rocket initially submitted the therapeutic to the FDA for review in late 2023, with a decision expected the following spring. The agency pushed back that deadline to June 2024, around which time it sent a complete response letter (CRL) asking for additional information about Kresladi’s manufacturing.

Walmart

Walmart might seem untouchable with approximately 4,600 stores across the United States, but even the retail giant is feeling the economic pressure. The multinational corporation that’s been ranked as the world’s largest company in terms of consolidated revenue is closing several stores all through 2025, with locations in California, Georgia, and Ohio already shutting their doors.

The good news is that this isn’t a sign of Walmart’s demise. The retailer has ambitious plans to build or convert more than 150 stores over the next five years while remodeling many existing locations. Still, if you’re a regular at certain Walmart locations, you might want to check if your local store is on the chopping block.

Albertsons

Albertsons has been through a rollercoaster ride recently. After announcing a $24.6 billion merger with Kroger in 2022, the deal was ultimately blocked in court over concerns about market domination. The chain is now having to face the consequences alone.

In an earnings call in January 2025, Albertsons’ leadership revealed plans to close numerous stores as part of a streamlining effort, noting that their portfolio was “outsized” in certain areas. The grocery chain hasn’t specified which locations are likely to be affected, but the closure process could reportedly extend over several years.

The company is also looking to open stores in other areas as part of its restructuring strategy, signaling a strategic shift rather than a retreat.

Kroger

With nearly 2,800 stores nationwide, Kroger is pretty much a grocery powerhouse, but like other grocery chains on this list, Kroger has also begun closing underperforming locations. Stores in Nashville, Tennessee, and The Woodlands, Texas, for example, are shutting down due to redevelopment projects. The retail company’s 800 Monroe Street location in Nashville will temporarily close in May 2025 for a $22 million remodel.

In late January, Kroger announced the closure of its Belle Meade Plaza store in Nashville due to redevelopment plans in the area. Additionally, Kroger’s Sterling Ridge location in The Woodlands, Texas, will cease operations on May 6, 2025. The company cited changing shopping habits and competition as the primary reasons for this closure and announced that staff at affected stores will be reassigned to other locations.

Winn-Dixie

The beloved Southeastern chain Winn-Dixie has undergone significant changes since its 2023 acquisition by Aldi. Initially, Aldi focused on consolidating operations, announcing closures of four Alabama stores (two in Mobile, one in Phenix City, and one in Vestavia Hills) and a Georgia location. They also revealed plans to convert approximately 220 Winn-Dixie and Harvey’s Supermarket stores to the Aldi format by 2027.

However, a pivotal shift occurred in February 2025: A private investor group led by CEO Anthony Hucker acquired 170 Winn-Dixie and Harveys stores back from Aldi. This move ensured the survival of the Winn-Dixie brand in five key states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Southeastern Grocers now plans to modernize these remaining stores and expand their offerings.

Safeway

Safeway is experiencing a particularly tough year, with multiple locations set to close in California and Maryland due to safety concerns and financial pressures. In February, the chain shuttered its Webster Street store in San Francisco’s Fillmore District after 40 years, citing “ongoing concerns about associate and customer safety as well as persistent issues with theft”. Despite reporting strong sales in recent quarters, Safeway’s decision reflects broader challenges facing urban grocery retailers.

More store closures are on the way, including the Vallejo store on Admiral Callaghan Lane in the Bay Area, which is scheduled to close in April. The company is also closing its Appian 80 location in Pinole after serving the community for over five decades. This follows a failed redevelopment plan and expired entitlements under new property owners.

Shaw’s

Shaw’s, which operates 125 stores across the region, recently announced the closure of two locations in 2025. Stores in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and Concord, New Hampshire, will also be shutting their doors, though exact closing dates haven’t been specified.

“Like all retailers, we’re constantly evaluating the performance of our stores,” a Shaw’s spokesperson said in a statement. “Closing a location is always a tough decision, but we’re focused on continuing to provide the products and services our customers value most”. Employees from these locations will be reassigned to nearby stores, but it’s a concerning sign for the regional supermarket chain.

The company stated these decisions were based on underperformance but reassured customers that nearby locations would remain operational.

Amazon Fresh

Despite Amazon’s seemingly unlimited resources and market dominance, its brick-and-mortar grocery concept, Amazon Fresh, is struggling to find its footing. The grocery store confirmed that it would close two of its stores located in California and Virginia.

These stores had only been operating for a couple of years before closure, raising questions about whether Amazon Fresh’s “frictionless” technology, which allows customers to simply walk out without scanning items, is actually appealing to shoppers. Some have already begun referring to these locations as “zombie stores”. While Amazon insists it remains committed to the Fresh concept, these closures suggest the e-commerce giant is still trying to figure out the right formula for physical grocery retail.

What is interesting to note is that while it is scaling back in the U.S., Amazon Fresh has expanded aggressively in India, reaching 170+ cities with 50% year-over-year growth.

Piggly Wiggly

Despite having perhaps the most charming name in the grocery business, Piggly Wiggly isn’t immune to 2025’s challenging retail environment. The iconic Southern chain is closing several stores this year due to lease expirations and declining profitability.

In March, a beloved Piggly Wiggly in Columbia, South Carolina, known as “The Social Pig,” announced it would be closing after 50 years of operation. Store operator Darrell Miller explained in a Facebook post that their lease had expired, and they were unable to negotiate terms that would allow the store to continue operating as a Piggly Wiggly. The announcement was met with an outpouring of community support, demonstrating how these local grocery stores often become important fixtures in their communities.

Dollar General

While primarily a discount retailer, Dollar General sells enough grocery items to make this list, and the chain is making some dramatic moves in 2025. In a Q4 2024 investor call, Dollar General announced it had conducted a “store portfolio optimization review” (corporate speak for checking which stores aren’t profitable enough) and would be closing 96 locations by early 2026.

The company is also converting six of its pOpshelf stores to Dollar General outlets and closing additional pOpshelf locations. For many communities, especially in rural areas, Dollar General provides essential access to groceries and household items at affordable prices, making these closures potentially impactful for local residents.

However, since the chain plans to open between 575–600 new locations in 2025, resulting in a net gain of 600 stores, this news shouldn’t be too concerning.",https://geekspin.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-exterior-of-a-Walmart-store.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 13:09:29.085716

The healthcare giant is seeking to right the ship after a series of financial challenges, particularly at its Aetna health plan division. Cowhey will vacate the CFO chair as of May 12, and will shift to serving as a strategic adviser to CVS CEO David Joyner, according to an announcement from the company.

Brian Newman, who most recently served as the chief financial officer for the United Parcel Service, has been tapped as executive vice president and CFO-designate, which will take effect April 21. Before his five years at UPS, where he played a key role in steering the company through the COVID-19 pandemic, Newman spent 26 years in financial leadership roles at PepsiCo.

Joyner said in a statement that he and the company ""wish [Cowhey] all the best in the future.”

""I am personally grateful for the leadership Tom has shown in his time at CVS Health, and before that, Aetna,"" Joyner said. ""He stepped up during a challenging year, and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities.""

In addition to the CFO shakeup, CVS announced that Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as executive vice president and chief medical officer. Compton-Phillips will step into the CMO role on May 19, and was most recently Press Ganey's chief physician executive.

Compton-Phillips also held clinical leadership positions at Providence and Kaiser Permanente, according to the announcement.

Joyner became CEO of CVS Health in mid-October following the departure of Karen Lynch. Since then, the company has made a number of leadership shifts as Joyner builds out his team. Former UnitedHealthcare CEO Steve Nelson was named as president of Aetna, while Mike Pykosz, who previously led Oak Street Health, departed CVS.

The company also made leadership changes at the helm of its pharmacy division, and named Ed DeVaney as president of its Caremark pharmacy benefit management unit.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” said Joyner. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well-suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/fiercehealthcare/1634483414/CVSpharmacy1.jpg/CVSpharmacy1.jpg?VersionId=VnOvP8PJGGMI2DxE2PaWrRSSwAAKb2ZF,N,,2025-04-08 13:10:01.589044

In mid-November, CVS announced the appointment of four new board members from Glenview, including the firm’s CEO, Larry Robbins. Glenview’s push came amid concerns over CVS’s performance and strategic direction.

Glenview’s impact was felt almost immediately at CVS. Its pressure led to the departure of former CEO Karen Lynch shortly after Glenview came on board and played a major role in the hiring of Joyner as CEO.

Newman’s hire likely stems from his experience steering UPS through the COVID-19 pandemic, a major union negotiation and the implementation of the company’s “1+2 strategy,” which aimed to grow revenue, cut costs and improve margins while navigating significant internal and external change. His background in managing large-scale logistics operations is also notable, as CVS Health aims to expand its health care delivery offerings while trimming expenses simultaneously.

In fact, operational excellence and customer experience aren't tradeoffs anymore — they amplify each other and are redefining loyalty.","(BPT) - Consumers today expect seamless, personalized, convenient shopping experiences wherever they shop. How can retailers stay competitive while ensuring they meet these expectations and stay competitive? Global technology leader in supply chain and omnichannel commerce Manhattan Associates recently launched its 2025 Unified Commerce Benchmark for Specialty Retail, co-sponsored by Google Cloud and conducted by Incisiv, to evaluate how 220 North American retailers are demonstrating exceptional omnichannel commerce maturity and delivering highly personalized experiences to their customers, both in-store and online.

The biggest takeaway? Only 5% of retailers achieved ""Leader"" status, demonstrating the ability to consistently deliver the much desired personalized experiences.

Learn from the Leaders

The overall Leaders of the 2025 Unified Commerce Benchmark study were: Apple, Best Buy, Boss, Dick's Sporting Goods, IKEA, Lululemon, Neiman Marcus, Nike, Ralph Lauren and Sephora. On average, these Leaders achieved 31% lower fulfillment costs and 24% higher customer satisfaction.

A key finding was that from 2023 to 2025, the bar for unified commerce has risen dramatically. One-third (33%) of the capabilities that differentiated Leaders in 2023 are considered basic requirements today, while an all new set of unique capabilities defines Leadership in 2025:

Shopping experience: Today's consumers move seamlessly across channels and touchpoints. Multi-channel shoppers spend 15% more per order as they blend shopping across social media, online marketplace and brick-and-mortar stores. Leading stores understand this shift (which influences up to 34% of all digital discoveries) more than 1.5 times the industry average.

Checkout experience: Checkout must be reimagined to seamlessly blend operational efficiency with deeper engagement and personalization. 70% of Leaders offer intelligent cart experiences that sync and adapt across channels, compared to just 31% of others. Retailers treating checkout as a strategic touchpoint — optimized for today's generation of tech-savvy shoppers — see 20% lower cart abandonment rates than the industry average.

Fulfillment experience: Today's consumers — accustomed to same-day delivery, real-time tracking and flexible pickup options — are redefining fulfillment expectations. 50% of industry leaders empower customers to modify their orders and delivery preferences post-purchase, compared to just 13% of others, setting new standards for convenience and flexibility.

Service experience: Consumers don't see channels, they see relationships. They expect every interaction to build seamlessly on the last without repeating themselves, no matter who they're speaking to. 90% of Leaders have unified customer service touchpoints to ensure smooth transitions between store, digital and phone support. The result? They witness half as many support escalations, particularly related to orders, compared to their peers. Additionally, their rapid adoption of GenAI self-service agents should reduce support calls even further.

""Every aspect of unified commerce is a driver of business success, and true leadership requires unwavering focus on every stage of the customer journey — from shopping and checkout to fulfillment and service,"" says Ann Ruckstuhl, SVP and CMO at Manhattan.

As the commerce ecosystem transforms at a blistering pace, retailers must continuously evolve their unified commerce capabilities to move forward. Unified commerce integrates all aspects of retail operation, from online and in-store sales to inventory management, order fulfillment and customer data, into a seamless, unified system capable of meeting consumer demand.

Factors making the difference

Businesses succeeding in this complex retail ecosystem are leveraging the latest technology to enhance shopper experiences. The conventional wisdom that operational excellence requires trading off efficiency for customer experience is being upended. When done right, customer-centric innovation actually drives operational advantages across every metric.

Optimizing GenAI: While 77% of retailers deploy chatbots for self-service, only 5% harness GenAI to elevate that experience. These technologies can scale personalization, streamline complex decisions and extend human expertise across channels with unprecedented efficiency.

For example, GenAI can use a customer's purchase and preference history to fix problems — like missing items or returns — before they even complain. Agentic workflows can check inventory and process returns without staff intervention, helping streamline processes.

These technologies don't simply connect channels; they solve complex challenges that previously limited unified commerce potential. As these capabilities improve, faster adoption will redefine what's possible in connecting physical and digital retail.

Solving inventory challenges: Real-time inventory visibility drives revenue. Digital integration improves inventory visibility so retailers know exactly where their sellable inventory is — helping them overcome any disruptions and ensuring products they need are in the right place at the right time.

""The outsized impact of inventory on top-line revenue growth is evident. Inventory visibility, availability and seamless shipping have become critical levers for driving business performance in today's competitive retail landscape,"" explained Ruckstuhl.

Maximizing customer relationships: The 24% higher customer satisfaction rate among Leaders demonstrates that operational excellence results in loyalty. In fact, operational excellence and customer experience aren't tradeoffs anymore — they amplify each other and are redefining loyalty. Today's multi-channel shoppers don't draw distinctions between channels. They blend discovery, purchase and service, including returns, across channels, demanding consistent expertise at every touchpoint.

Customers who witness consistently convenient, trouble-free experience are more likely to remain loyal to those brands, whenever and wherever they shop.",https://d372qxeqh8y72i.cloudfront.net/3a4b1f6d-82db-47e8-bd31-c50f4f767417_wide.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 16:05:23.547302

Kearney Global Luxury Industry Outlook Reveals Key Trends Shaping the Future of the Market

The 21-page report, “Why stability is the new growth,” includes a detailed look at how brands have evolved over the past 30 years to meet changing consumer demands. In this post-pandemic period, brands are approaching growth much differently than they did in the 1990s and 2000s — an era of mass consumerism where the focus was on a back-end infrastructure capable of pushing out as much product as possible.

The researchers said brands are taking a hybrid model approach where they leverage wholesale for stability, direct-to-consumer for customer engagement and use marketplaces for supplemental reach, which reflects a shift toward a more methodical and resilient approach.

The report’s authors found that while 57 percent of brands surveyed are investing in retail relationships, “only 34 percent plan to enter new geographic markets. Growth strategies emphasize customer loyalty and sales diversification over pure optimization.…Key drivers include geographic and product expansion and omnichannel investments.” Meanwhile, the research showed that operational improvements (such as new warehouses or production facilities) “are a lower priority, reflecting a shift toward customer-facing growth rather than back-end infrastructure development.”

The report’s authors said wholesale continues to play a crucial role in stabilizing markets, shifting from a growth driver to a tool for optimizing distribution and controlling costs. Brands are prioritizing controlled growth, predictable pricing and stronger retail partnerships over rapid scaling via marketplaces or digital transformation.

In a cautious economic landscape, efficiency and relationship-focused strategies are taking precedence over risky expansion. Supply chain resilience remains a priority, emphasizing supplier collaboration, demand forecasting and contingency planning rather than structural changes like nearshoring. Meanwhile, B2B e-commerce platforms present untapped potential for deeper operational automation and integration.

Chris Akrimi, general manager for B2B at NuOrder said the new priority for many brands “is achieving sustainable growth while maintaining a strong focus on financial performance. Strategic, measured expansion is now a key consideration for both existing and new clients, a trend we see consistently across our portfolio.”

Akrimi said brands are doubling down on strengthening wholesale and retail relationships and optimizing distribution while expanding their networks, but they’re doing it with a more calculated approach. “They are seeking flexibility in pricing, contract terms and inventory commitments to navigate ongoing economic uncertainties that unfold daily,” he explained. “Rather than chasing broad distribution, brands are prioritizing ‘quality over quantity,’ choosing retail partners that offer long-term, sustainable growth. They are aligning with retailers that invest in brand storytelling, focus on sell-through and protect brand image, ensuring a balanced and profitable partnership.”

The report also looked at how AI can be leveraged by brands to increase operational efficiency and increase personalization. But the authors of the report said brands have been slow to implement the technology. The report said the current evolution of B2B e-commerce “will not reach its full potential without deeper investments in digital transformation and AI-driven efficiencies.”

Andrea Luna, client success team lead at NuOrder, said despite the clear value of B2B e-commerce platforms, many brands struggle, not due to technical limitations, but because they haven’t fully embraced a digital-first mindset. The real challenges lie in operational inertia, fragmented adoption and underutilization of existing tools. Too often, digital platforms are treated as supplemental rather than transformational, leading to missed automation opportunities and inconsistent buyer experiences.”

Luna said success requires more than just onboarding users; “it means equipping teams to leverage the platform’s full capabilities — building campaigns, creating custom lists and working seamlessly across devices. Brands that lead in digital transformation integrate intelligent, automated workflows that drive adoption and enhance efficiency at every stage.”

If you're in the market for some tech products, you're likely concerned about when the right time to buy is, when prices will increase, and how much they will increase. ZDNET scoured reporting from across the web that should help provide some clarity on your next steps.

The tariff impact

Because tariffs will impose higher prices on goods imported into the US, companies importing parts or devices from overseas will pay higher prices. How that trickles down to the consumer is a matter of how the company chooses to handle the additional costs.

Higher costs for goods typically leave companies with several options: absorbing the cost themselves, raising the prices of the items to offset the increased costs, or some combination of both approaches.

Some tech companies have already issued statements expressing their intent to increase prices for buyers. For example, in a February interview with The Telegraph, Jason Chen, the chief executive and chairman of Acer, said the company would raise its prices by 10% to cover the cost of the tariffs. In a March earnings call, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said price increases for American consumers would be ""highly likely.""

Other companies are shifting business operations to accommodate the tariffs. For example, Nintendo announced it was delaying its preorders for its upcoming Switch 2 in the US days after launching it to the public. The console is manufactured overseas, so the company is likely reevaluating pricing and costs.

A Wall Street Journal report claimed Apple was planning to send more iPhones to the US from India because of the high tariffs imposed on China. Since that report was published, Trump has passed sweeping tariffs across many more countries, including India. Vietnam, which also hosts major manufacturing plants for Apple, was also inflicted with tariffs in this latest wave.

As these examples show, price hikes for tech products are nearly inevitable. How much they will increase is to be determined, but some reports give us an idea.

A $2,300 iPhone?

You may have seen the headline about a $2,300 iPhone. Although Apple itself has not confirmed that -- or any -- iPhone price increase, the Reuters article that number came from does give users a clear understanding of how it reached that number -- and why it may be a viable reality.

Analysts from Rosenblatt Securities told Reuters that if Apple passes on increased component prices to consumers, the price of an iPhone could rise by as much as 43%. That would place Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, the top-of-the-line iPhone, at $2,300 if a 43% increase were added to the current $1,599 price.

To give another example, a research analyst at TechInsights told The WSJ that the iPhone 16 Pro's hardware (256GB) costs around $550, and the phone is sold to consumers for $1,100. The new tariffs could raise the hardware cost to $850; if the same profit margins are maintained, the overall price could increase accordingly -- by around $300.

Customers interested in new iPhones are already flocking to Apple Stores to make the purchases before the tariffs impact prices. A new Bloomberg report found that Apple Store employees across the country said that their stores were filled with customers panic-buying iPhones over the weekend.

Beyond iPhones, tariffs are bound to permeate other tech products and industries more broadly. To help conceptualize the impact, CBS News put together a price tracker with graphs depicting how much the impact could be across products most impacted by tariffs. Right now, it includes fruits and vegetables, cars and trucks, and raw materials, such as aluminum, which is often used in tech products.

Should you buy tech now?

Ultimately, the decision to buy tech is a personal one that includes many factors, such as your personal needs and disposable income. Based on the information above, it is safe to say that prices are expected to rise. So, if you really need something, now could be a good time to buy.

CVS Health named a new CFO Tuesday as the healthcare giant continues to shake up its leadership team.

Brian Newman, most recently CFO of shipping and logistics firm UPS, will start at CVS on April 21. Tom Cowhey, who took on the permanent CFO position at CVS early last year, will become a strategic advisor to CEO David Joyner, effective May 12.

In addition to the leadership change, CVS said it expects financial results for 2025 to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance. In February, the company reported expected adjusted earnings for the year between $5.75 and $6 a share.

Dive Insight:

Newman will receive a base salary of $1 million, and his target annual equity award compensation will be $7 million, CVS said in a securities filing.

Cowhey will step down from the finance chief position about a year and half after he first took on the interim role.

He started at CVS in 2022, and then took on the interim CFO job in October 2023 after previous finance chief Shawn Guertin left due to family health reasons.

Cowhey will serve as strategic advisor and assist with transitioning his work until he leaves the company on a date that hasn’t yet been determined, according to a securities filing.

CVS also named Amy Compton-Phillips, previously chief physician executive of survey and patient experience firm Press Ganey, as chief medical officer, beginning May 19. She replaces Sree Chaguturu, who was named president of CVS’ healthcare delivery business in November, the company said in the filing.

The latest appointments come as CVS has made a number of recent leadership changes in recent months while it navigates a challenging financial environment.

The company’s profits were nearly cut in half last year as CVS’ insurance unit, Aetna, weathered heightened medical costs, particularly in government healthcare programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.

Joyner took up the chief executive post in October, replacing Karen Lynch as the firm pulled earnings guidance due to elevated expenses at Aetna. Weeks later, the company named Steve Nelson, previously the CEO of value-based primary care company ChenMed, as president of the insurer.

CVS also tapped Ed DeVaney to serve as permanent president of CVS Caremark, the healthcare giant’s pharmacy benefit manager, in February.

Based on year-to-date results through February, the Company currently expects financial results will meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for full year 2025. Our financial closing procedures for the first quarter of 2025 are not yet complete and, as a result, expected results for the full year may change due to such financial closing procedures, final adjustments, management’s review of results, and other developments that may arise between now and the time our financial results for the first quarter of 2025 are finalized.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” said Joyner. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.

“I am personally grateful for the leadership Tom has shown in his time at CVS Health, and before that, Aetna. He stepped up during a challenging year, and helped position our enterprise for long-term growth opportunities. I wish him all the best in the future.”

“It is an honor to join CVS Health, its leadership team, and the Finance organization at such an important time in health care,” said Newman. “I am confident in our continued success and growth potential, and I look forward to putting my experience to work as we help our clients, customers, and colleagues succeed.”

“As a clinician, I see the best our health care system can do, and as an administrator, I have seen the challenges that stop us from doing our best all the time,” said Dr. Compton-Phillips. “CVS Health has every opportunity to deliver simply better health, and that starts with the patient-medical professional relationship. I am committed to making sure we do all we can to improve the experience and outcome of every person we serve.”

Managers at the US arm of the British lender will no long have to consider how new hires and promotions advance the careers of women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds, who have traditionally been overlooked in the banking sector.

The bank’s chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, made the decision after a review, which started late last year, into its approach to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

A Barclays spokesperson said that the review was “still under way” and that “in the meantime, we have taken the decision to no longer have specific US representation ambitions. Our representation ambitions for the rest of the group will continue, and are being considered as part of the review.”

They added: “We remain committed to a culture which values inclusiveness and equality of opportunity across Barclays.”

The spokesperson clarified that the review, run by its head of DEI, Natalie Hattrell, began before Trump won the presidential election in November.

While Barclays had not set US-specific targets, its 11,600 US staff, including those in offices in New York, Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, were expected to adhere to global targets. Those included the goal of 33% of director and managing director roles being held by women by the end of 2025. Staff from under-represented ethnicities were also due to make up 50% of those senior positions.

Barclays is maintaining targets for the rest of its roughly 91,260 global staff, including the 43,180 it employs in the UK.

Venkatakrishnan said in the memo, first reported by Bloomberg: “The group executive committee has been carefully considering the changed environment in the US. As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

The US rollback comes two months after Venkatakrishnan, who was born in India, told journalists that Barclays had an “enduring commitment to a culture of inclusivity in the bank. It’s enduring and unwavering”.

“If you want to get the very best people, by necessity, you get a very diverse workforce,” he said during a full-year earnings call in February. “We want to provide equality of opportunity, and we want to create that inclusive environment in which people really can shine, excel and contribute to this bank. So that’s our approach, and we will continue to run the business and run the company in that way.”

Trump used executive orders after returning to the White House in January to reverse DEI policies in the federal government. While the orders did not directly apply to the private sector, he called on companies to follow suit, and asked the US attorney general’s office to consider how the rules could be more widely enforced.

It started a wide-ranging reversal, with several large US corporations, including Walmart, McDonald’s, Ford and Amazon, announcing plans to scrap or scale back their DEI schemes.

Barclays is the latest UK company to drop some of its DEI targets, with others, such as the pharmaceutical company GSK, going as far as pausing diversity activities for UK workers.

Last month City regulators at the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority controversially announced they were not planning to introduce new diversity and inclusion rules for financial companies and would instead support “voluntary industry initiatives”.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce589aab64301fc9823769f54385e5e1e9178382/0_318_5601_3361/master/5601.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e5f737bcbfb7ae47c3a8c25b5f7735d4,N,,2025-04-08 13:09:33.918914

After shifting sourcing from China to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia during Trump’s first term, brands now face another spike in costs as President Trump introduces new tariffs on the latter countries, sending shockwaves through the global fashion supply chain.

Trump has introduced a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods, but the fashion industry is far from dealing with just that.

For about two dozen countries where the US runs a trade deficit, those tariffs are much steeper. Vietnam, a cornerstone of the global athletic footwear supply chain, is among the hardest hit. A new 46% tariff now applies to Vietnamese goods headed to the US, compounding the 20% duties already in place for textile-topped athletic shoes.

That’s a serious issue for the likes of Nike, which makes 50% of its footwear in Vietnam, and On, a Swiss sportswear company which manufactures a staggering 90% of its shoes there.

Vietnam is the world’s second-largest apparel exporter to the US after China, which itself is now subject to a 54% tariff, including earlier duties. Cambodia faces a 49% tariff, Bangladesh 37% and the European Union 20%.

The impact is already visible. In after-hours trading, shares of Lululemon fell more than 10%, Nike and Ralph Lauren dropped 7% and Tapestry, Capri and PVH Corp saw a dip of around 5%.

Fashion companies have little room to manoeuvre. Moving manufacturing out of Vietnam is no quick fix.

Production relocation: Easier said than done

Trump wants to bring production back to the US, but the fashion industry says it’s not feasible.

American factories lack the specialised equipment and skilled labour needed to make running shoes at scale. Nike, which first started manufacturing in Vietnam in 1995, now works with 130 supplier factories in the country. Adidas makes 39% of its footwear there too.

This week's tariff hike hits brands hard. Nike shares have dropped to their lowest in nearly eight years, weighed down by rising costs and competitive pressure from brands like On and Hoka.

While Nike hasn't commented directly, its latest quarterly report mentions ""several external factors that create uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment, including, but not limited to, geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, tax regulation and fluctuating foreign exchange rates.""

Supply chain ripple effects will be wide

The strain goes beyond big-name brands. The US Fashion Industry Association put it bluntly: “We are deeply disappointed by the Trump Administration’s decision to impose new tariffs on all imports. This action will particularly affect American fashion brands and retailers.”

From suppliers in Vietnam to textile makers and farmers worldwide, the entire chain will feel the pressure. Walmart, among others, has said it will negotiate with suppliers to lower costs, but many factories already operate on tight margins. The squeeze is set to intensify.

Retailers face a dilemma: absorb the higher costs or pass them onto shoppers already hit by inflation. With consumer confidence in the US already at its lowest since the pandemic, fashion brands are treading carefully.

And if costs are passed to consumers, expect more selective shopping habits and fewer impulse buys, which could dent profits further.

In short the global fashion supply chain, from factories in Asia to shelves in America, is bracing for disruption.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8266e7d9a18bce77dc4f5a623c5320a2:786961211d06cd459fa5e48692cb0766/danilo-capece-novnxxmdni0-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 13:10:55.335546

Washington Prime Group, according to a WARN notice filed with the state, will cut 139 jobs at its 4900 E. Dublin Granville Road headquarters.

A spokesperson for the company said the business has been downsizing as it sells assets in its portfolio – approximately half of which were sold last year with the remainder still on the market or soon to be.

Washington Prime owns more than 70 properties across the U.S. Its Ohio portfolio includes Polaris Fashion Place, Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, The Mall at Fairfield Commons in Beavercreek and the Lima Center in Lima.

But the company also is losing its office space through no fault of its own.

Its Dublin Granville Road headquarters also is the former Big Lots Inc. headquarters.

That building was acquired in February by OhioHealth.

According to court documents in Big Lots' ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, Washington Prime was notified in February the lease would be terminated. It moved into that building in 2023. It previously was downtown at the Continental Plaza.

Washington Prime declined to comment on whether it is fully eliminating its Central Ohio office presence and neither the WARN notice nor its statement to Columbus Business First acknowledged the lease termination.

The company also has corporate offices in Indianapolis.

The local cuts begin in June and could take until March 31, 2026 to complete, according to the notice.

“Internally, the company's strategy has been transparently communicated and understood for some time and WPG has worked closely with employees to ensure they have the resources and support needed to help them on their career journey,” Washington Prime said in a statement.

The company is providing support including severance packages and access to outplacement services such as job search assistance, resume workshops and professional headshots.

The majority of first-class mail, 75%, should notice no change to their first-class mail delivery services, the postal service said.
Union workers have argued that mail delivery is a vital public service that shouldn't necessarily turn a profit.","Changes are coming to how mail is delivered across the United States as the U.S. Postal Service continues to find itself in the crosshairs of a Trump administration determined to slash federal spending and increase efficiency.

President Donald Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts, led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, have not spared an agency that otherwise operates and funds itself independently.

The changes hitting USPS this month, which took effect April 1, are part of a 10-year plan, dubbed “Delivering for America."" Ultimately, the plan includes cutting jobs, adding a new fleet of electric delivery trucks to replace existing trucks that keep breaking down and slowing delivery for many rural customers.

The changes also come amid growing protests from postal workers and supporters opposed to service reductions, which USPS says will help save the organization $36 billion over a decade.

Here's what to know:

What is the USPS?

The United States Postal Service, older than the U.S. itself, delivers to 165 million addresses six times a week.

Although the postal service is technically an independent agency, Congress maintains close control.

But some critics who have long wanted to see the agency overhauled have pointed to the significant challenges the USPS has faced as Americans send fewer letters, Christmas cards and wedding invitations. Last year, the service handled more than 116 billion pieces of mail, with most of that being presorted mailers, solicitations, or other items that many people would consider ""junk"" mail.

Last year, the postal service lost $9.5 billion as private companies like FedEx and UPS outcompete it for some parcel deliveries.

10,000 jobs to be cut; postmaster strikes deal with DOGE

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy stepped down after inking a deal in March with billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency.

DeJoy said the deal with DOGE, which has torn through the federal government to slash spending in the name of reducing waste, will ""assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.""

The deal came after the USPS announced in January a voluntary early retirement initiative expected to result in about 10,000 jobs being cut. More than 75% of the postal service's budget goes to paying its roughly 635,000 workers, and those 10,000 job cuts reflect only a 1.5% staffing reduction.

According to a news release from the American Postal Workers Union, workers who opt to retire early are eligible for a one-time $15,000 incentive paid in two parts.

Appointed during the first Trump presidency, DeJoy said in a letter to Congress that DOGE would help usher a “historic level of transformational change"" by reducing costs.

How will mail delivery be different?

The changes that went into effect this month will affect millions of customers across the country. While the moves are designed to improve efficiency and cut costs, some people may notice slower delivery.

According to the USPS, service standards will be ""refined"" for:

First-class mail.

Periodicals.

Marketing mail.

Package services (bound printed matter, media mail, and library mail).

USPS Ground Advantage.

Priority mail.

Priority mail express.

Delivery of first-class mail is expected to take no more than five days, while the 2-5 day range for USPS Ground Advantage will also stay the same, the postal service said. Certain postage like marketing materials, periodicals and other packages may even be delivered faster, according to the USPS news release.

The majority of first-class mail, 75%, should notice no change to their first-class mail delivery services, the postal service said. However, 14% will be upgraded to a faster standard, while another 11% of first-class mail will be delivered slower, though still within the 1-5 day deliver window.

For more precise expectations, the USPS is now using 5-Digit ZIP code pairs, rather than current standards that are based on 3-Digit ZIP code pairs.

USPS already has a map online that will let customers see how long it will take to deliver mail from one ZIP code to another.

More changes coming

The next changes are set to take effect July 1. More information will be released closer to that date.

Trump suggests merging USPS with Commerce; Musk wants it privatized

Trump, who has long been critical of the USPS and its declining deliveries, has in the past floated the idea that it be merged into the Commerce Department. Such a move would bring the now-independent postal service under Trump's authority.

“It’ll remain the Postal Service, and I think it'll operate a lot better than it has been over the years,” Trump said on Feb. 24. “It's been just a tremendous loser for this country.""

Musk has also suggested privatizing the agency, as many other countries have done. Such a move would likely require congressional approval.

Rural communities could be unequally impacted

Unlike the postal service, private companies do not have the same service obligations requiring delivery to rural or sparsely-populated areas – even at a loss. Companies like FedEx and UPS can charge higher prices for harder deliveries in such area, or simply not deliver to them at all.

Instead, those companies are more likely to focus services on areas with more people, more places and more profit.

In contrast, the postal service is required to deliver to virtually every address in the country, regardless of how much it costs. Some mail carriers even still use mules or horses to deliver to Supai, Arizona, a remote Havasupai tribal village in the Grand Canyon of Arizona, or float planes to serve fishing villages off the Alaskan coast.

Under a privatized system, mail outgoing and incoming to rural regions would likely be delayed. Service could become much more expensive or be cut off entirely.

Postal workers rally after DOGE threatens to dismantle USPS

News that Musk's DOGE team would be scouring the service for savings sparked recent protests across the U.S.

Thousands of unionized postal workers and their supporters rallied across the nation in late March to protest proposals to dismantle the U.S. Postal Service. Union workers have argued that mail delivery is a vital public service that shouldn't necessarily turn a profit.

Social media can be daunting for a business, from keeping up with trends to creating content to continuously posting across platforms. But, much like retail media, social media is becoming a must-have for grocers as one of the most effective ways to earn the loyalty and attention of Generation Z customers, sources say.

Gen Z shoppers already represent a significant portion of the market and are only growing. As of 2024, Gen Z shoppers made up 21% of the U.S. population and possessed $984 billion in spending power, according to Kantar Retail IQ.

Nearly 60% of consumers discover new products via social media, making social media the top channel for social commerce, according to a report from Inmar Intelligence. In addition, 78% of consumers consider a brand’s reputation on social media to be very important.

Most grocers post on multiple social media platforms, including the ones that are the most popular among Gen Zers, Instagram and TikTok. But while grocers are active on these platforms, an analysis of eight major grocers found that no one is posting consistently high-performing content. Likes, views and interactions vary largely from post to post, signaling that these companies haven’t found ways to build a loyal, engaged follower base.

Grocers continue to struggle to gain a consistent, loyal traction on social media

Grocers' follower and like counts on TikTok and Instagram, respectively, as of April 8, 2025

Based on a scroll through each grocer’s Instagram and TikTok profiles, it’s clear that these retailers tend to stick to videos that show off their products. Whether these posts are cooking demos, ingredient bundles or creative food hacks, they typically mimic influencer-style videos. Though this strategy makes sense, grocer’s posts still receive limited traction.

There’s a solution to this, however: Let full-time influencers and content creators themselves take the lead in grocers’ social media marketing, according to Ranjana Choudhry, senior vice president of media and data platforms for Inmar Intelligence.

If you can’t beat them, join them

Why try to become an influencer when you have a grocery business to run?

Influencer partnerships, including giveaways, sponsorships, product reviews and collaborative content creations, are expected to become more popular in the overall marketing landscape.

Already, 59% of marketers reported plans to partner with more influencers this year compared to 2024, sister publication Marketing Dive reported using data collected by Sprouts Social. Business-to-consumer brands, which include grocers, tend to engage in a higher volume of influencer partnerships compared with the average.

To resonate with shoppers through social commerce, retailers must create an environment that “revolves around meaningful, discovery-driven interactions” that pair entertainment with the path to purchase, according to Inmar’s report. While grocers can begin to build this on their social media pages, influencers offer a more direct path.

More than 80% of consumers purchase items based on creator recommendations, according to Inmar. Even if the influencer has a limited following, 80% of surveyed consumers reported they would buy something on social media based on “a random piece of creator content, regardless of follower size,” Inmar found.

Influencers also allow for more flexibility in the social commerce space. TikTok is all the rage — hence why even neighborhood grocery stores are making videos on the platform — but the platform’s 12-hour shutdown in January caused marketers to see a “significant drop in their reach and engagement,” according to the report. While audiences may not refollow their go-to grocery company on another social media platform, they are likely to follow their favorite creators and communities “wherever they go,” Inmar said.

“For the first time, brands and retailers can actually combine this creator-authentic content and authentic following with very clear targeting to retail customers,” Choudhry said. “So there is a lot of affinity that [retailers] can drive.

Creating authenticity, measuring impact

Authenticity is something that can only come from influencers, because even if a retailer posts so-called relatable content, viewers will still see it as a traditional advertisement rather than content, according to Inmar, adding that 73% of consumers trust creators as much or more than traditional advertisements.

However, there is a way to translate this authenticity — and that’s where retail media networks come into play.Grocers can use their retail media networks to scale creator content made for their company across digital platforms. This would enable companies to more accurately measure the impact and performance of an influencer’s content as well as allow them to tap into a creator’s “trust factor” across their follower base, Inmar said.

This more tangible feedback on creator content performance and impact will also help retailers know which influencers are best to partner with, as it will allow them to select creators whose follower base is likely to drive sales performance.

Without this technology and the ability to connect audiences to purchase power, retailers would be forced to assume or guess, Choudhry said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-Rjqfr0495DEaoNWWLIWPzz11Ehry2GYERo-2mIZtRE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjI3OTUyMzY0XzFfWG9GSW0wYi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:30.818195

Age: 86 (born February 24, 1938)

Height: 5 ft 9 in (175 cm)

Business: Co-founder and former CEO/Chairman of Nike, Inc.

Net Worth: Approximately $40 billion (as of 2025)

Spouse: Married to Penny Knight

Few names are as synonymous with modern sportswear and brand dominance as Phil Knight. What began as a modest idea in the mind of a University of Oregon track athlete eventually became Nike, one of the most recognized and profitable companies in the world. Knight’s journey wasn’t just about building a shoe company — it was about transforming global athletic culture.

The Humble Beginnings: Blue Ribbon Sports

In 1964, Knight teamed up with his former track coach Bill Bowerman to start Blue Ribbon Sports, originally a distributor for Japanese running shoes from Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS). Knight sold the shoes out of his car at track meets while balancing an accounting job — an image that would soon contrast sharply with the billion-dollar empire Nike would become.

The Birth of Nike

In 1971, after parting ways with Onitsuka, the partners launched Nike, Inc., named after the Greek goddess of victory. The iconic Swoosh logo was created by a graphic design student for just $35 — a branding move that would become one of the most valuable trademarks in history.

Knight’s early focus was on performance and innovation — lightweight shoes with improved cushioning and traction. But it was bold marketing (think: ""Just Do It"") and celebrity athlete partnerships (like signing Michael Jordan in 1984) that catapulted Nike into the stratosphere.

The Mastermind Behind the Brand

Phil Knight served as CEO of Nike from 1964 to 2004, and remained Chairman until 2016. During his leadership, Nike grew from a scrappy startup to a $180+ billion global powerhouse, dominating the market in footwear, apparel, and equipment.

Knight is known for his unconventional, fiercely competitive business style — blending intuition with strategic risks. His memoir Shoe Dog reveals many of the hurdles and near-failures Nike overcame on its way to global domination.

Does Phil Knight Still Own Nike?

Yes, Phil Knight still owns a significant portion of Nike. Through Swoosh LLC, a holding company, Knight and his family own about 22% of the company, making them the largest individual shareholders. His son, Travis Knight, also holds substantial shares and is involved in the family’s business interests.

Who’s the Biggest Shareholder in Nike?

Individual: Travis Knight (via trust) – approx. 17.8%

Institutional:

The Vanguard Group – approx. 7.1%

BlackRock – approx. 5.5%

The Knight family still exerts considerable influence over the company, despite Phil having stepped back from an active leadership role.

How Long Was He CEO?

Phil Knight served as the CEO of Nike for an impressive 40 years, leading the company from its founding in 1964 until his retirement in 2004. Even after stepping down as CEO, Knight remained deeply involved with the company, serving as Chairman of the Board until 2016.

Shoe Dog: The Story Behind the Swoosh

If you want an unfiltered look into the trials, triumphs, and sheer chaos behind building a global brand, Shoe Dog is a must-read. In this candid memoir, Phil Knight shares the gritty, behind-the-scenes journey of launching Nike from selling sneakers out of the trunk of his car to facing financial ruin and navigating global success. It’s not just a business book, it’s a story about passion, risk, resilience, and chasing a crazy dream.

What Does the Nike CEO Make Now?

As of 2024, Elliott Hill has taken over as the new CEO of Nike, stepping into one of the most high-profile roles in the sportswear industry. Hill’s annual compensation package is estimated to be around $27 million, which includes a combination of base salary, performance bonuses, and stock options. His earnings are slightly below those of his predecessor, John Donahoe, who earned approximately $29.1 million in 2023. Despite the shift in leadership, Nike continues to reward its executives generously, reflecting the company’s ongoing global influence and profitability.

Phil Knight’s Legacy

Phil Knight didn’t just build a company he built a culture. From innovation in footwear to game-changing marketing and brand loyalty, Knight’s vision helped make Nike not just a product, but a global symbol of ambition, athleticism, and edge. His journey remains a blueprint for entrepreneurs across industries.

Why ‘Raising Prices Is The Most Viable Path Forward’ Morgan Stanley Research said that “raising prices” for products” is the “most viable path forward” for hardware companies it covers.
For instance, “there is little flexibility to pull forward/stockpile inventory, and diversifying supply chains takes too long,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

The research arm of global banking giant Morgan Stanley called President Trump’s across-the-board tariffs a “lose-lose” situation for hardware companies such as Apple, Dell Technologies and HP Inc., saying that “raising prices” for products is their “most viable path forward.”

Morgan Stanley Research delivered the assessment in a research note last Thursday, a day after Trump announced so-called “reciprocal tariffs” ranging from 25 percent to 54 percent for goods coming out of roughly 60 countries and regions, which he said are meant to boost the U.S. economy and “protect American workers.”

[Related: ‘Confusion,’ ‘Uncertainty,’ ‘Pain’: Solution Providers Grapple With Trump’s Tariff Regime]

These new tariffs are set to go into effect Wednesday, with goods from Asian manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand expected to face tax rates of 46 percent, 32 percent and 36 percent, respectively.

Since the report came out, Trump has warned that he will impose an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which would bring total import taxes to 104 percent for such things, in response to China’s counter-tariffs on U.S. products.

While some of the targeted countries and regions have said they are seeking new trade deals with the U.S. to remove tariffs, China said Tuesday it would “fight to the end” and continue countermeasures in response to Trump’s latest threat, the Associated Press reported.

Trump has indicated he is open to striking trade deals, saying on Tuesday that he spoke with South Korea’s acting president about a potential deal while saying that China “wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started.”

Dell, HP Say They Have ‘Agile’ And ‘Resilient’ Supply Chains

A Dell spokesperson told CRN on Monday that the Round Rock, Texas-based company is “reviewing and assessing the impact of the tariffs announced last week.”

“Dell has a strong track record of leading through any environment with our globally resilient and agile supply chain,” the representative said in a statement.

In a statement to CRN, an HP spokesperson said Tuesday that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company “has an agile and resilient supply chain that helps us adapt to the evolving economic landscape to ensure we deliver for our partners and customers.”

“Our strong relationships with supply chain partners around the world allow us to remain agile and responsive to changes, as we are not tied primarily to company-owned infrastructure or factories in countries heavily impacted by tariffs,” the representative said.

“We will continue to monitor developments and have the ability to adjust operations as needed,” the HP spokesperson added.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

Why And How Tariffs Will Hit Apple, Dell And HP

Morgan Stanley Research said the tariffs “add to the growing list of concerns” it has for the hardware companies it covers, which include Apple, Dell and HP. Other companies in the firm’s coverage that will be impacted by tariffs include Logitech, Sonos, Garmin and GoPro.

“As we highlighted last week, policy uncertainty, deteriorating business/consumer sentiment, and worsening macro data have resulted in slowing enterprise hardware spending growth and persistently negative consumer electronics spending intentions since late February,” the firm wrote.

“Yesterday's reciprocal tariff announcements will likely amplify these headwinds,” it added.

That’s because companies like Apple, Dell and HP “rely on extensive international manufacturing, with the large majority of finished goods sold into the U.S. assembled in [southeast] Asian Nations, making them [the] worst positioned” among the companies it covers, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

Many of these hardware companies, including Apple, Dell and HP, started reducing their reliance on manufacturing in China in 2018 during the first Trump administration, the firm said. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, for instance, has moved roughly 15 percent of iPhone production to India since then, and all its MacBooks for the U.S. market are now made in Vietnam.

Dell and HP, on the other hand, “diversified U.S.-bound notebook production to Vietnam and Thailand, respectively,” Morgan Stanley Research added.

While shifting production outside China was previously seen as a way for these vendors to lower their exposure to tariffs, this is no longer the case, the firm said.

That’s because Trump has cast a wide net with his latest round of tariffs, hitting countries like Thailand and Vietnam that were previously seen as safe for U.S. vendors to use as manufacturing hubs, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

“With yesterday's reciprocal tariff announcement, there becomes very little differentiation in friend shoring vs. manufacturing in China—if the product is not made in the U.S., it will be subject to a hefty import tariff,” the firm wrote.

Given Apple’s exposure to tariffs due to its reliance on Asian manufacturing hubs, the iPhone giant would face an estimated additional cost of $33 billion annually, which would represent 26 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

For Dell and HP, “the added tariff cost could equate to nearly the entirety of their expected net [incomes] in 2025,” the firm added.

Why ‘Raising Prices Is The Most Viable Path Forward’

Morgan Stanley Research said that “raising prices” for products” is the “most viable path forward” for hardware companies it covers.

That’s because the widespread nature of the tariffs makes most of their other mitigation tools “ineffectual,” according to the firm.

For instance, “there is little flexibility to pull forward/stockpile inventory, and diversifying supply chains takes too long,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

As for absorbing the extra costs created by tariffs, this would guarantee a “significant margin headwind” for impacted vendors, the firm added.

These companies could consider redirecting products to markets without tariffs, “but it would depend on the usable infrastructure available,” Morgan Stanley Research said.

As a result, the firm considers the tariffs a “lose-lose” situation for hardware vendors.

“Raising prices is the most likely mitigation tool, in our view (all imports now face tariffs, so the playing field has been somewhat leveled), but it's inflationary and guaranteed to negatively impact demand, given the severity of some pricing increases,” it wrote.

Could Shifting Production To The U.S. Be The Answer?

Morgan Stanley Research said it’s “unlikely” that hardware companies would ever shift production to the U.S., citing cost, time and resources as well as expertise and policy uncertainty as “barriers to entry.”

The firm said it would cost “hundreds of billions of dollars” to stand up manufacturing plants in the U.S., “not even counting the wage disparities between [southeast] Asia and the U.S.” For example, Apple supplier Foxconn spent more than $1.5 billion, inclusive of perks like lower power costs and subsidies as well as tax breaks, to build a manufacturing complex in China that produces roughly 50 percent of the world’s iPhones, it said.

“Standing up a manufacturing facility in the U.S. would take, at the very minimum, 9 months with a running start and labor availability. Most likely, it would take years. And then there is the question of available labor in the U.S.,” the firm said.

“We'd presume that even with automation/humanoids/robots, there aren't enough skilled workers in the US with expertise in tooling,” it added.

The uncertainty over U.S. policy will also hold back companies from investing in domestic manufacturing capacity, according to Morgan Stanley Research.

That’s because with Trump in his second term as president, policy “could be vastly different” in four years, the firm said.

“The last two recessions the pharma industry has fared pretty well,” Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, told BioSpace.
“Before we go overboard, [pharma’s] still recession resistant,” Wong said.
Jefferies said that the macro uncertainties due to the tariffs “have triggered a continued flight to safety,” on the markets.
“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,” Ricks explained.","With GLP-1s making the pharma industry more exposed to consumer spending than ever, the tariff chaos could break pharma’s recession-resistant reputation.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. If the world does indeed fall into a recession following the widespread tariffs put into place by President Donald Trump—as many indicators are suggesting it will—pharma could be particularly vulnerable. With the U.S. population growing older and suffering from more chronic diseases, personal healthcare expenses are on the rise for everyday people who could be forced to make difficult decisions like skipping medications.

The most significant recession in recent memory was the 2008 financial crisis, which was spurred by the collapse of the housing market and financial systems in the U.S. More recently, a shorter recession cropped up due to the pandemic. In both cases, pharma was largely immune. You have to buy your medicines even if the economy is tanking.

“The last two recessions the pharma industry has fared pretty well,” Arthur Wong, senior director of corporate ratings, healthcare, at S&P Global Ratings, told BioSpace. “People can’t really skip their prescriptions.”

According to Jefferies, pharma outperformed the S&P 500 through both recessions and in the years immediately following, because the industry is “overall a more defensive beneficiary of money flow in economic downturns.”

In the case of COVID, biopharma even enjoyed an influx of funds as investors poured money into the industry as it raced to develop vaccines and medicines that could stymie the rampant global outbreak. Jefferies said that pharma outperformed the S&P 500 by about 10-20% during that recession.

But this time around, things are different, experts say. Since those two events, GLP-1s have risen precipitously, but insurance coverage has not followed as neatly. That means the market has been defined by consumers, with many more patients pocketing the costs of GLP-1 medicines themselves. Trump also just nixed an executive order from his predecessor Joe Biden that expanded Medicare coverage for the therapies, cutting off another avenue for access—at least for now.

Wong told BioSpace he expects GLP-1s to take a hit if a recession does settle in. “You’ll still see growth,” he predicted, “it’s just that you will see a slowdown in adoption with things like this,” as patients back off paying out-of-pocket for weight loss medications.

Moreover, healthcare has grown as a larger portion of the GDP since the early 2000s, Wong noted. The population has aged, meaning more of them have chronic health conditions and are taking prescriptions for longer. Healthcare is becoming a larger part of people’s personal budgets. It remains to be seen how they will weather a recession.

“Depending on when the next recession hits, how deep it is, is it going to have a bigger impact?” Wong asked. “I would guess yes.”

Paying Up Front

Before the recession fears, insurance companies had faced increasing pressure to open up coverage of obesity medications. Wong said he thinks that now is not the right time to try to convince insurance companies to shoulder the cost because they are facing the same macro headwinds as any other industry and are beholden to their shareholders.

“The health insurers are all struggling and trying to control their medical-cost ratios,” he said.

The argument posed by companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the GLP-1 market leaders with tirzepatide and semaglutide, respectively, has been that their products can eliminate downstream health challenges. Both have pursued indications beyond just weight loss. Semaglutide, approved as Wegovy for weight loss, has been approved for reducing cardiovascular risk and for kidney disease, while Lilly nabbed an FDA nod for sleep apnea for Zepbound. Insurers just will not see this as the right time to make that down payment, Wong said.

“I think they can agree that they see savings down the road, but are they willing to pay for it up front? And is there money in the budget right now to pay upfront?” Wong asked. “They buy into [the idea of these drugs]. It’s just at what level of adoption [and] how aggressively can they provide coverage in this current environment.”

Even with covered drugs, the out-of-pocket expenses can be high. While it’s easy to assume that people will continue taking their medicine, Wong said that during the previous recessions, there were reports of “pill-splitting,” when people cut doses to make their prescriptions last longer or delay refilling.

“Before we go overboard, [pharma’s] still recession resistant,” Wong said. “I don’t think it was ever recession proof, but it is still recession resistant. I think it becomes less recession resistant as we go on, just because healthcare spending is a bigger part of the pie in terms of people’s budgets.”

The Tariff Threat

This moment for GLP-1s also comes as pharmas are directly battered by tariff uncertainty,, which Wong says the industry has “sidestepped”—for now.

Shares of Eli Lilly, now the largest pharma by market cap, have declined 12% in one month from a high of $864 apiece on March 24, wiping out $95.4 billion in market value. Novo, which takes the fourth slot below Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie in terms of market cap, has lost $72.4 billion in market value in the same time period, with shares falling 26% in one month to $63.64 at close Monday.

Jefferies said that the macro uncertainties due to the tariffs “have triggered a continued flight to safety,” on the markets.

“We expect macro to have the steering wheel,” the firm said.

Lilly CEO David Ricks told the BBC last week of the tariffs that “it’ll be hard to come back from here.” While much of the innovation in pharma is done in the U.S., Ricks said that the industry relies on global locations for production, including active pharmaceutical ingredients.

According to a recent survey from the industry group BIO, nearly 90% of all U.S. biopharma companies rely on imported API for FDA-approved products. If tariffs were imposed on Europe, half of companies would have to find new research and manufacturing partners, while 79% with Chinese contracts would be greatly impacted if that country is levied with huge tariffs.

“We have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,” Ricks explained. Those trade-offs would include layoffs and reductions in R&D first and foremost, which Ricks called “a disappointing outcome.”

One expert who spoke to Truist Securities called the panic an overreaction and instead insisted that it’s a great time to be investing in biopharma. This person “sees this whole process of tariffs as a ‘revolution,’” to bring assets back to the U.S. to guard against unforeseen events like a war or another pandemic.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/d1fe95c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/985x554+8+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2Fee%2F3149943c4100a14a46aaeed7a311%2Funtitled-1000-x-563-px-2.png,N,,2025-04-08 16:05:28.014530

Continuing their move to the upside this morning after topping first quarter earnings expectations and maintaining full year forecasts. The jeans maker excluding the effects of President Trump's tariffs, the executive saying they anticipate a minimal impact near term. Still, the company says it may be required to modify sourcing practices which could impact product costs. Joining us now, Harmeet Singh is Levi Strauss's chief financial and growth officer. Harmeet, it's great to speak with you. So you are keeping your forecast, but you said that it assumes no deterioration in the macro environment. Can guidance be guidance right now if it does not include the impact of tariffs?

Good morning. Thanks for having me here. Um, as you know, we reported a very strong start to the year, our quarter one beat top line and bottom line expectations. Revenue, organic revenue accelerated and we were up 9%. Our EBIT margins expanded and we're up 400 basis points and EPS was up 50, uh you know, 52%. So overall, real strong start to the year. Our transformation strategies are working as we pivot to a DDC first lifestyle company. Um you know, our DDC results, which is direct to consumer, which includes our stores and e-commerce, uh you know, it was up 12%, 12 consecutive quarter of growth and what I like to call a tri-fecta, which is, you know, we're growing compsales, we're adding profitable new stores and we're growing e-commerce. And so, you know, a real strong start to the year and good momentum. To your question about guidance, medicine, um, it's uh, it's early days. Yes, the tariffs, uh, that were imposed have created more uncertainty. We are best positioned to navigate it. Uh, the situation is very fluid. Um, and the way we think of guidance is it's important to give expectations when we are clear, uh, about uh the expectations. We were very clear about quarter two and we guided quarter two, which is again, uh, you know, growing 3 and a half to 4 and a half percent on an organic basis. Gross margins continue to improve and we guided our EPS expectations. Uh, and so that's the reason we stuck with the full year guidance. Uh, you know, uh, just before the announcements of tariffs, given the results we had in Q1, we were debating whether we should take up full year guidance. Uh, but given that it's just the beginning of the year, and then the announcement of the tariffs, we felt prudent at this day to maintain our full year guidance.

Understood. So I know that you've also as part of that introduced a tariff task force internally. Our sourcing indicates that some items that you have could increase their costs by as much as 100%. Does that feel accurate to you?

Not entirely, only because if you think of our supply chain, yes, so first, we have got a task force. The task force is working 24/7. It's how we have managed other, uh, you know, previous crisis and we've actually, being a company has been around 170 years, we have navigated through them and emerged stronger post the crisis. Uh the task force is really looking at all options. They're looking at cost management options, they're looking at how we manage and talk to our different stakeholders, customers, our vendors who we have long tenure relationships and also looking at pricing options, you know, from that perspective. Uh, to your question about a diversified supply chain, uh, you know, we source from 28 different countries, uh, and not any country makes up more than 25% of, uh, you know, what we source from into the US. We source from 20 countries. We have the product already for spring and summer and that's why, you know, we were very clear about expectations for quarter two.

Harmeet, this is Nancy Tengler. I'm a native San Franciscan, so Levi holds a very special place in my heart, but I'm wondering if you anticipate any retaliatory demand issues from, from some of our trading partners.

Nancy, we haven't seen any retaliatory, you know, pushback from consumers. As a brand, we have been present internationally for over 80 years. Uh, we have deep connections with the consumers, you know, we're an American brand with a global presence and 60% of our business is overseas. Um, and so you know, as far as we are seeing international as an example was up 9% into 75% of the apparel market is outside the US and we are connecting really well with the consumers globally.

All right, Harmeet, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.

WPP acquires InfoSum to power WPP Open.
Handing data over, moving data, leakage of data: it’s not good for privacy.
Forget whether you own data or not, asking your clients to ‘please send me your data’ – it just has to stop.","So, a real, tangible point of difference between marketing’s monoliths is a tasty dish for the industry’s commentariat to feast on. Look closely and you’ll find the holdcos’ biggest such difference in an unlikely spot: how they source and share data.

In short, some want to own robust data sets that resolve into identity-matched profiles of real people. Some want to build platforms to connect others’ data sources as quickly and safely as possible.

British holdco WPP, firmly in the latter camp, solidified its position by acquiring fellow London-founded InfoSum last week. The latter is a specialist in data clean room technology – a category that Lauren Wetzel, chief executive of InfoSum, tells The Drum the company “created and defined” with its “different way of doing data collaboration,” which prioritizes data safety.

Reports of the price WPP paid for InfoSum have not been confirmed, but former owners, investment group Chrysalis, posted reports of $63m in cash gains on the day of the sale.

The move follows WPP’s acquisition of Stability AI, the generative AI developer of Stable Diffusion, last month and the gradual folding-in of agency T&Pm last year, all in service of a much-vaunted $300m investment in its AI platform WPP Open this year.

InfoSum will become a part of Choreograph, the global data company that itself sits within GroupM, WPP’s media investment business. It’s the final keystone in that approach to data that diverges markedly from WPP’s competitors, Evan Hanlon, global chief executive of Choreograph, tells The Drum. “Now, we have all the pieces.”

The war on identity: A primer

Many commentators have been quick to point out how unsurprising the move is: GroupM chief executive Brian Lesser spent four years at the helm of InfoSum from 2020 to 2024. And beyond any personal ties, Lesser has been loudly beating a drum for an approach to big data that he has called “a shift from ID to AI,” under which “we believe that data connectivity is more important than simply owning a database… No matter how many traditional IDs you own, it will never be enough.”

The line was a jab at WPP’s competitors, which are investing heavily in the ‘identity-based’ approach to big data that prizes owning vast supplies of data sources that can resolve the identities of internet users to deliver personalized messaging. WPP shares that final goal but not the method. Its divergent approach instead prizes connecting disparate data sources and providing an environment that is not reliant on any particular set of the ‘profiles’ that identity-based approaches yield.

Almost on cue after Lesser’s identity-bashing speech, WPP’s biggest competitor, Publicis Groupe (which had recently leapfrogged it to become the world’s biggest ad company), went public with its acquisition of data shop Lotame, adding 1.6bn profiles to its sack and doubling down, hard, on identity. Scott Hagedorn, chief solutions architect for the group, told The Drum at the time: “Without an identity footprint, marketers can’t really do modern marketing.”

He added: “The problem is, when you become dependent on syndicating identity, you’re going to get charged every time you use that identity. That’s why we’ve been able to make identity and AI work for our clients: because we’ve made investments to own it and not rent it.”

In the rarefied air of marketing’s holding company world, this is the equivalent of a flame war. On one side, WPP is rejecting identity as the center of any sensible data approach, while on the other, Publicis (alongside newly merged Omnicom and IPG with their equivalent to Epsilon, Omni) is insisting that identity is modern marketing’s very core.

“The pattern is clear,” says Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester: “Omnicom acquires IPG in part for Acxiom to power Omni. Publicis acquires Lotame to bolster CoreAI. WPP acquires InfoSum to power WPP Open. In the near future, clients will no longer buy the agency, but rather the agency’s algorithm for advertising, media and experience activation.”

‘Intelligence beyond identity’

Choreograph’s Hanlon acknowledges an element of “intellectual sparring” in the air as the two approaches butt heads. But InfoSum-bolstered WPP is doubly bullish on its ‘intelligence beyond identity’ strategy.

The argument is two-fold: that acquiring data to develop understandings of identity alone is insufficient for the marketing environment and that what WPP is building – capped off by the InfoSum acquisition – helps marketers plug the gaps of identity with whatever their most salient data sources are at the time.

First, the negative element. Identity alone, Hanlon says, is a “very good data set – but it’s not the only one and it’s less and less useable today,” with increases in privacy protection, cookie opt-outs and untrackable browsers. Worse, he says, identity alone is inherently backward-looking. “If you’re only focused on the data that you can acquire, you’re going to miss-serve your clients because you’re looking at a very narrow slice of the world – one that is frequently archaic, using antiquated technologies, that gives you a really great look back at what has happened but doesn’t give you a lot of predictive power about what is going to happen in the future.”

The answer, Hanlon says, is AI, data connectivity and building an environment to do that data connection quickly and securely – enter InfoSum. “Look at the challenge and the opportunity of what AI lets us do – which is to associate lots of different data domains, data types and data models for apples-to-apples comparisons in ways that we couldn’t before (fast and slow data; big and small data; panel and census data; US data and UK data), in ways that are privacy safe, leaving the data where it sits. It was clear to us that we needed a technology like InfoSum to help us move to the speed at the speed that we need to.”

Amid all the talk of identity, this reintroduces a pair of concepts, not long ago dominant, that are talked about less when providers are looking to amass as many identity-resolved ‘profiles’ of real people as possible: data privacy and safety. For InfoSum’s Wetzel, this is the true core of her company. “The mission we’ve been on is acknowledging and calling out the way data has been used to power, generically speaking, data-driven advertising. It has just never been the right method. Handing data over, moving data, leakage of data: it’s not good for privacy. It’s awful for security. And it needs to be rearchitected. Forget whether you own data or not, asking your clients to ‘please send me your data’ – it just has to stop. And being closed about the value has to stop.”

She adds: “It needs to be open and transparent. The tenets of privacy protection are critical because it’s just not going to go away. It doesn’t matter if there’s regulation or not. Consumers care. Brands take a long time to build trust with their consumer and they can lose it in a second. I find our agenda being warmly embraced by CMOs who just don’t want to take any of that risk on.”

As for Publicis’s comments about the inefficiencies of renting over owning data: “I would check the receipts,” says Wetzel. “[Publicis] is going to prove the value of acquiring Lotame and Epsilon and it absolutely is passing that charge back. It is packaging it with media and the data that it owns and probably some consulting services and a handful of other things, but it is absolutely passing that cost and pocketing the money for it”.

So, the respectful disagreement between the identity school and the intelligence school doesn’t look likely to end soon. And as Nicole Greene, vice-president and analyst specializing in AI at Gartner, tells The Drum, AI’s still-early-days spread into every corner of the marketing ecosystem will only intensify the great data debate: “AI requires quality data, so it’s no surprise that holding companies are racing to position themselves for the AI-enabled advertising future. The battle lines are drawn around privacy, security and the depth of consumer insights, with each company tooling up to meet the demands of an increasingly data-driven, privacy-centric advertising landscape.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/opinion/355641/wpp_infosum.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-04-08 12:24:28.886724

“As a global organisation, we have always complied with the local requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have operated. In doing so, we have remained faithful to our workplace culture.”

Barclays’ decision comes just months after Mr Venkatakrishnan in February told reporters the British bank was committed to creating an “inclusive environment”.

Speaking on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call, the Barclays boss said: “If you want to get the very best people, by necessity, you get a very diverse workforce. We want to provide equality of opportunity, and we want to create that inclusive environment.”

The reversal follows the Trump administration’s far-reaching campaign against corporate DEI initiatives that has seen the US president ban all diversity programmes in the US federal government.

Top banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have watered down their own DEI programmes in response to the Trump administration’s pushback.

JP Morgan rebranded its own DEI initiatives under the name Diversity, Opportunity and Inclusion (DOI) last month.

Major British firms including Deloitte have also scrapped their DEI programmes in the US while keeping them in place in Britain, in response to President Trump’s attacks.

At the end of 2023, 30pc of Barclays’ executives were women, while 5.1pc of its staff in Britain and 21pc of its employees in the US were from “under-represented minorities”, according to the bank’s most recent DEI report.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/04/08/TELEMMGLPICT000355798800_17441247866040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:07.007382

The FDA is reviewing a request for approval of FcRn blocker nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). J&J is late to the party, with argenx and UCB already selling rival FcRn blockers, but has bet big in the belief nipocalimab has advantages over the competition. Ongoing dosing with argenx’s Vyvgart and UCB’s Rystiggo is based on clinical evaluation. J&J has studied consistent dosing of nipocalimab.

The Big Pharma previously reported a 5.73-point reduction on a gMG symptom scale after 24 weeks of the open-label extension. The reduction hit 5.97 points at Week 48. Tuesday, J&J published the latest cut of data from the ongoing extension trial, reporting a reduction of 5.64 points after 60 weeks.

The average symptom score fell 6.01 points in people who switched to nipocalimab from placebo after the trial’s double-blind period. Forty-five percent of antibody-positive patients reduced or discontinued steroids. The mean dose of the steroid prednisone decreased from 23 mg to 10 mg a day.

If the FDA approves nipocalimab, the long-term data could form part of J&J’s pitch for the gMG market. The labels for argenx’s Vyvgart, in its intravenous and subcutaneous forms, state the safety of delivering ongoing doses less than 50 days apart hasn’t been established. The figure for UCB’s Rystiggo is 63 days.

J&J, which acquired nipocalimab in its $6.5 billion takeover of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, has made the case that its FcRn blocker should be safer than rival molecules because it is highly specific to the IgG binding site without overlap on the albumin binding site. Consistent nipocalimab dosing could support sustained disease control, strengthening J&J’s play for the gMG market and other indications.

However, the company will face a well-established rival in gMG. Argenx won approval in 2021 and later launched a subcutaneous version. The biotech has pointed to the established safety profile of Vyvgart as a factor that could help it hold off competition.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-183536286_0.jpg?VersionId=oagu4K16lMogfjbq8j5qRmH2EYY3sKha,N,,2025-04-08 14:11:06.654058

The McRig was created with one goal in mind: to show up when people need it most. When disaster strikes and communities are left picking up the pieces, this fully equipped mobile kitchen rolls in, bringing hot meals and a sense of normalcy to those who need it. Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, or local events, the McRig is ready to lend a helping spatula.

The McDonald’s McRig is equipped with state-of-the-art kitchen facilities, allowing it to prepare and serve a wide range of McDonald's menu items. The truck is also designed to be self-sufficient, with its own power and water supply, allowing it to operate in areas with limited infrastructure.

How Does McDonald’s McRig Support Local Communities?

When deployed, the McRig is run by local franchisees in the impacted areas to provide immediate support after disasters. Each meal donation that the McRig offers underscores McDonald's commitment to supporting local communities.

One of its standout moments came in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in 2022. In collaboration with its local Florida franchisees, the McDonald’s McRig delivered 17,000 free hot meals to residents in Southwest Florida. Over four days, the McRig, provided freshly prepared grab-and-go meal delivery, including cheeseburgers, McNuggets, French fries, apple slices, and bottled water.

The McDonald’s McRig doesn’t drive itself, and it certainly doesn’t cook its own burgers. It’s powered by an incredible team of logistics pros, operations, and community members who ensure that everything runs smoothly.

The team is responsible for ensuring the McRig is always ready to deploy at a moment's notice. This includes regular maintenance, stocking the truck with necessary supplies, and coordinating with local authorities and organizations.

The operations team oversees the actual deployment, ensuring the McRig is set up and functioning efficiently at the disaster site.

Community members play a crucial part in identifying areas where the McRig's support is needed most. They work closely with non-profit organizations and government agencies to ensure the McRig's efforts are aligned with the needs of the affected population. This collaborative approach ensures that the McRig can provide the most support possible.

The McRig is a reminder that in tough times a warm meal can make all the difference and embodies our commitment to leaving a positive impact on the communities we serve.",https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/logo/mcd_corp_social_feed_default.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:24:08.110183

The Tech in the UK 2024 report from Barclays Eagle Labs shows where high-growth businesses (such as scaleups and academic spinouts) are concentrated outside London, highlighting how these are contributing to their local economy. It uses Gross Value Added (GVA) as a comparable measure of the economic contribution of businesses to these regions.

The report shows that local areas with 100+ high-growth companies boast an average Gross Value Added (GVA) per business of £294k, compared to just £27.5k for those with less than 100. Manchester benefits the most from its businesses, which contributed £30bn to the area in 2022.

Edinburgh is home to 450+ high-growth tech companies, where Scottish Enterprise plays a key role in commercialising research for carve outs. 198 deals were signed here between 2020-24.

Bristol also benefits from efforts between universities, such as Brunel Centre, a joint data hub between the University of Bath and UWE. Last year investment was up 10% at £167m, with Bristol’s wider deeptech cluster “Silicon Gorge” now spanning Bristol, Gloucester and Swindon.

However, boosting local economies isn’t simply down to higher numbers. Cambridge and Leeds are each home to 280 high-growth companies – in Cambridge, whilst every £1 spent by businesses contributed to £8 of economic impact, businesses in Leeds contributed quadruple the impact due to its broader base of industries.

Investment in Cambridge last year passed half a billion, whilst the wider Yorkshire & Humber region (with Leeds) received just £179m. Continuing to invest in diverse economic hubs across the North of England can be seen as a priority on this basis.

Access to finance remains key for these high growth businesses across the UK, although almost 7 in 10 (68%) report they are aware of all the financing options relevant to them.

Sam's Club and Costco, known for their low prices and bulk products, usually limit their hours or close completely during holidays like this. This can cause frustration among consumers who rely on these stores at critical times.

Albertsons: Flexible Hours Depending on Location

Although most Albertsons stores will be open, the company has warned that hours may vary depending on the location. Customers will need to check their local store hours, as these may be adjusted according to local regulations or demand in each area. This flexibility is key to ensuring that consumers can access products without complications.

Opening on Easter Sunday also shows Albertsons's commitment to customer convenience. In an increasingly competitive market, where online shopping is rapidly growing, offering physical shopping options is an advantage that not many competitors can offer on holidays.

Sam's Club and Costco: What Will They Do?

Albertsons's announcement comes at a key moment. With Sam's Club and Costco closing on Easter Sunday, consumers who need to make quick purchases might turn to Albertsons. Both competitors, despite offering attractive prices, have a policy of closing on these days. This behavior could put Albertsons in a dominant position.

Sam's Club and Costco specialize in wholesale sales, but consumers can't always wait for their stores to open after Easter Sunday. Therefore, Albertsons's decision to keep its doors open represents a clear advantage over these retail giants.

Convenience as a Key Factor

Convenience is a crucial factor in shopping. On dates like Easter Sunday, consumers are not only looking for low prices but also the ability to access fresh and essential products. Albertsons's opening during this holiday allows them to gain the preference of those who need to shop without complications.

This approach also reinforces Albertsons's image as an accessible supermarket chain, willing to adapt to consumer needs. At a time when shopping habits are changing, decisions like this could be key.

Long-Term Impact for Albertsons

Albertsons's move has a potential long-term impact. Opening on holidays can result in an increase in sales, which in turn strengthens the relationship with consumers. People who benefit from this flexible schedule might feel more inclined to choose Albertsons for future purchases.

Moreover, this opening strategy can be an example for other supermarket chains that traditionally choose to close on important holidays. If Albertsons achieves good results with this measure, it is likely that other brands will be motivated to follow their example.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/exterior-albertsons-tienda_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:02.329828

For policy servicing, it automated simple transactions, eliminated back-office dependencies, updated core systems for renewals, and streamlined standard non-financial services.
This enabled a data-driven and automated workflow approach, now improving processes across new business, policy servicing, and claims, improving efficiency and operational outcomes.","Leaving legacy apps behind

While serving 18 million customers across 24 markets in Asia and Africa, a leading APAC insurer identified an opportunity to enhance efficiency by integrating and automating its systems. However, doing so would require modernizing the organization’s Singaporean operations.

The insurer’s legacy business process management system forced employees to navigate multiple applications for essential tasks. This included viewing allocated tasks, accessing medical and non-medical documents in content manager, and reviewing underwriting decisions in their existing tool. In addition, users had to track case statuses and histories, including audit trails, in a separate policy administration system. The company envisioned a one-stop solution to simplify key activities like risk assessment, policy issuance, and claims management and eliminate inefficiencies.

To realize this vision, the insurer partnered with Capgemini, leveraging its extensive experience in similar transformations and its technical expertise to deliver a seamless solution.

Building a new workflow application

Capgemini and the insurer collaborated through a series of workshops spread out over three months which provided an opportunity to analyze key processes, such as new business, policy servicing, and claims, and identify where automation could most effectively support additional efficiency.

The solution involved developing a low-code/no-code cloud-based workflow application to streamline operations and reduce reliance on legacy systems. Leveraging its partnership with IBM, Capgemini implemented a BPM workflow with a customized UX/UI aligned to the insurer’s enterprise architecture. A laser focus on change management ensured a smooth transition, while a flowchart-style rules engine and automation tools enhanced decision-making and operational efficiency overall.

Scalable efficiency

The scalable platform, with key features like case segregation based on underwriting (UW) and straight-through processing (STP) decisions, and automatic allocation to user groups based on customer segments, UW decisions, and plan types, were developed during this transformation. This has significantly reduced policy issuance timelines. A unified dashboard set up, now consolidates all relevant information, ensuring a seamless user experience and supporting further digital transformation.

To significantly reduce reliance on multiple applications and cutting turnaround times, the system also introduced the auto distribution feature, which enabled load balancing while accounting for employees’ availability and defined case parameters. This allows the processing of hundreds of policies daily.

The transformation enabled a 60% increase in end-to-end straight-through processing for new business by integrating multi-channel application submissions, automated data extraction, classification, and a unified UW workbench. For policy servicing, it automated simple transactions, eliminated back-office dependencies, updated core systems for renewals, and streamlined standard non-financial services.

Additionally, claims operations benefited from the introduction of STP with electronic submissions, rule-based assignments, and skill-based workflows. This enabled a data-driven and automated workflow approach, now improving processes across new business, policy servicing, and claims, improving efficiency and operational outcomes.

Capgemini continues to maintain the application, with plans to scale the transformation further. As a next step, the insurer is set to roll out these solutions in other Asian regions, extending the benefits of the initiative. As the partnership evolves, Capgemini remains committed to supporting the insurer’s efforts to optimize services and claims processes.",https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Leading-APAC-insurer-client-story-web-preview-image.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 14:10:55.603182

Walgreens was the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024, but has recovered some ground in 2025.
So that's an interesting fit there, even though we know CVS has done a lot more in the health delivery space.
Eli Lilly, uh, talking about 27 billion for four manufacturing, uh, uh, buildouts in the in the coming years.
We do know that any additional manufacturing like, uh, that already exists here, any capacity that already exists here is really going to benefit getting, you know, that windfall from anyone scrambling to to get their, uh, manufacturing going.","Shares of Walgreens sticking higher this morning after the company reported an earnings beat for the second quarter, as it prepares to go private. Walgreens was the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024, but has recovered some ground in 2025. Here with more on everything happening around Walgreens Boots Alliance, we've got Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Where do you want to start on, because we've got the earnings, we got the company going private, there's a lot swirling.

Yeah, I know. It's a lot. I'll start with the company going private because that actually shifts how we're gonna be covering earnings, of course, once they go private, but also for right now they've completely cut us off. No, I'm kidding. They don't have an earnings call today. So I don't have additional context for you other than what the numbers say, and that's something, um, that we're gonna have to deal with moving forward. They've also pulled 2025 guidance, and that has not seemed to impact the stock negatively, as you noted it is up today. But let's take a look at the numbers and what they said, beat on the revenue, expected 38, beat with 36 38.6 billion. And then not just did earnings per share at 63 cents rather than 53. Now, wanna look at some of the other numbers, cuz we know that they're still in a cost management mode. So while they have reduced the loss since the quarter last year, uh, CEO Tim Wentworth sent a statement that the strategy to reduce cost is still in play and will take some time and so that's what we're looking at. Uh, loss per share, uh, in total $3.30 versus Q2 of 2024, which was $6.85. So that's something to keep in mind. Meanwhile, um, looking at the decrease, um, in the revenue this year had a little bit to do with tax rate front-end slow stores, slow sales at front of store, but then also, uh, a hit through legal settlements. So 969 million of legal payments, and that is from an old case with Everlywell, a COVID testing company that they had, uh, some disagreements with on how they partnered. And then an and then opioid related settlements still weighing on the company. So that's something to keep an eye on as they continue their trajectory into privatization.

It's, I can't think of a better time to have the excuse of privatization to be able to cut your forward guidance that really works out for Walgreens in this moment. I I do wanna get your take on Julian and another story in your beat that we are monitoring, which is CVS making some leadership changes this morning. What can you tell us?

Yeah. So that's an interesting one, because, um, going from one company to the other, CVS the last one standing in this really large retail drug space, um, the last ryan and having to deal with its own moves. We know that they had to shift through their CEOs, they had a shake up there now, David Joyner is CEO. And so now they're bringing in Brian Newman as the new CFO replacing, uh, Tom Cowey. And so Brian has been at UPS and other retail companies. So that's an interesting fit there, even though we know CVS has done a lot more in the health delivery space. They have a CFO in the retail space there. And then a new executive vice president and Chief Medical Officer, Amy Compton Phillips. Uh, looks like she's gonna be taking over that role from uh, Sricharu who's also taking on who also has another role as, uh, president of healthcare delivery. So a little shift there. So interesting moves right now, as we know the company is, uh, you know, dealing with some of the same pressures that Walgreens was facing in terms of, you know, weakness in front of store sales and just all the changes that are coming down the pike with prescriptions, PBMs, etcetera. So should be interesting to see how this pans out.

You know, investors have heard us talk a lot about healthcare at the start of this year and and and here from fact set is perhaps one of the most important markers of why. Healthcare sector expected to report the highest year of year earnings growth rate of all 11 sectors at 35.8%. You think about the industry and the sector right now, US drug manufacturers, they're planning a lot of shifts right now too. How are they planning for shifts under President Trump's tariffs as well though that are moving for?

We saw this before the tariffs were even announced. We have major companies like Johnson and Johnson, Eli Lilly and Merck announcing multi-billion dollar projects for shifting manufacturing to the US. You can see on your screen the numbers there, Johnson and Johnson with that 55 billion. Eli Lilly, uh, talking about 27 billion for four manufacturing, uh, uh, buildouts in the in the coming years. All of this is a long-term process though. And so in the meantime, in the interim, while these tariffs start to take place, we know that the manufacturing of drugs wasn't heavily hit by tariffs, but there are going to be announcements of, uh, terrorists that do affect pharma and so that's what they're expecting. And so in that interim, these companies have sort of ahead of the curve, tried to make announcements and and curry favor with the administration. We do know that any additional manufacturing like, uh, that already exists here, any capacity that already exists here is really going to benefit getting, you know, that windfall from anyone scrambling to to get their, uh, manufacturing going. It's also interesting to note that, uh, it is very company specific, um, and also pharma subsector specific, because medical devices are still going to be impacted by those tariffs, and that's an a subsector that is trying to work with the administration to come out of impact as well.

Health care giant Johnson & Johnson is one of the most well-known and respected brands, and its response to the 1982 tampering of Tylenol bottles that killed seven people is held up in business schools as a model.

But in “No More Tears: The Dark Secrets of Johnson & Johnson,” veteran reporter Gardiner Harris uses his investigative skills to scrutinize the legacy of the company, as well as that of federal regulators. What he unveils is a damning portrait.

It’s a story that Harris writes “has been hiding in plain sight for a very long time,” but his comprehensively reported and researched book goes much further.

Harris takes a deeper dive in looking at Johnson & Johnson’s history, including the story behind the litigation against the company that it settled for billions of dollars over its baby powder containing talc powder.

He details a litany of controversies involving the company ranging from the effects of its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal to the company’s role in the nation’s opioid crisis.

But Harris doesn’t spare others from scrutiny or criticism with his book. Namely, he focuses on what he calls the false mythology of the Food and Drug Administration, detailing times when the agency fell short of protecting consumers.

He also trains his eye on the American media itself, noting ways that reporters at times portrayed the FDA’s actions against drugmakers as tougher than they really were.

Dive Brief:

Johnson & Johnson said Monday it has enrolled the first patient in a pivotal study of a device for clearing “difficult-to-cross” coronary arteries.

Like other products made by J&J’s Shockwave Medical, the Javelin intravascular lithotripsy catheter uses sound pressure waves to break up calcium deposits that are blocking blood flow.

The device is differentiated from other Shockwave products, and rival catheters from Abbott and Boston Scientific, because it emits waves from its tip. Other devices send waves from a balloon catheter that must cross the blocked part of the artery to be effective.

Dive Insight:

Shockwave revealed the Javelin device at an investor event in October 2023, months before accepting a $13.1 billion buyout bid from J&J. The company developed Javelin after recognizing that balloon-based catheters are unable to pass through some vessels. If physicians cannot get a balloon across a vessel, they cannot use Shockwave’s other IVL devices to remove calcium deposits.

By miniaturizing its IVL technology, Shockwave developed a catheter capable of emitting waves from its tip. Rather than crossing the artery and then emitting waves from the balloon, the device sends out IVL pulses from the tip to clear deposits and allow the catheter to advance along the vessel.

The Food and Drug Administration cleared a Javelin device for use in peripheral vessels last year, opening up more of the below-the-knee market. The new study will enroll up to 158 patients across around 35 sites in the U.S. and U.K. to generate data to unlock more of the coronary market.

J&J’s investment in Javelin technology could provide a point of difference versus companies that are mounting challenges for the IVL market. Boston Scientific recently entered the space by agreeing to pay $443 million upfront for Bolt Medical. Abbott acquired an IVL program in 2023 as part of its $890 million takeover of Cardiovascular Systems and received approval to start a trial in the U.S. last month.

Abbott’s device uses a balloon to widen parts of the arteries that are narrowed by calcium. Similarly, Bolt was working on a balloon catheter when it accepted Boston Scientific’s offer.

The poll of 3,023 workers across the U.S. focused on perks and benefits that drive employee retention. While competitive pay continues to draw headlines, the results show that generous leave policies, health care offerings and lifestyle benefits are equally — and sometimes more — important in keeping employees engaged.

In New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson secured the top spot for its robust family support offerings. The company provides 18–20 weeks of paid maternity leave (based on tenure), 12 weeks for all new parents, and up to $20,000 per child for adoption or surrogacy. Other benefits include on-site fitness centers, global mental health support and dual-career assistance — all helping it stand out among working parents and employees at every life stage.

Nationally, the top five employers based on perks and benefits were:

Google (California)

Famous for its over-the-top workplace culture, Google still offers perks like free gourmet meals, nap pods, laundry services and on-site gyms. More importantly, it provides generous family leave, fertility assistance and premium health benefits. While some of the flashier perks have been scaled back in recent years, the company continues to lead in employee experience.

The Coca-Cola Co. (Georgia)

Atlanta-based Coca-Cola offers a rare combination of a traditional pension plan with a 401(k) match, along with solid health insurance, tuition reimbursement and adoption support. Its “Total Rewards” approach ensures that both financial and personal well-being are covered.

Ben & Jerry’s (Vermont)

In South Burlington, Ben & Jerry’s blends social values with standout perks: six months of paid parental leave, livable wages and a famously sweet benefit — three free pints of ice cream a day. The company’s relaxed culture and emphasis on personal freedom make it a favorite in Vermont.

Hawaiian Airlines (Hawaii)

As Hawaii’s largest airline, Hawaiian Airlines gives employees — and their families — unlimited standby flights, 20 guest passes a year, and profit-sharing bonuses. The company’s culture of hospitality extends to its internal team, with a focus on loyalty and long-term support.

Nike (Oregon)

Nike emphasizes work-life balance through generous PTO, flexible schedules, and sabbaticals for long-tenured employees. Wellness programs, tuition reimbursement and career advancement paths reinforce its commitment to employee growth. Perks also include discounts on Nike and Converse gear, early product drops, and daycare options at some locations.

“These findings show that salary alone doesn’t seal the deal,” said Raymond Lee, president of Careerminds. “Companies that invest in holistic employee experiences — from mental health to long-term financial planning — are building the workplaces where people want to stay and grow.”",https://images.roi-nj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/leadership_business_goals_challenges_success.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:54.195144

As Singapore gears up to welcome 18.5 million visitors in 2025—nearing pre-pandemic levels—brands are intensifying efforts to capture peak travel demand with more strategic and targeted offers.

“Managing seasonality in travel and leisure requires some strategic marketing, including things like personalised offers, leveraging local events and dynamic pricing,” said Adam Furness, Managing Director for Asia Pacific at impact.com.

Furness noted that combining flights, hotels, and services into dynamic bundles drives higher conversions during peak periods. “It’s all about maximising conversions during the peak season, collaborating with airlines, hotels, travel agencies to offer exclusive time-sensitive deals also drives urgency and sales,” he said.

“Partnerships with tourism boards, festival organizers, local government or cultural institutions can enhance destination appeal and encourage repeat visits,” he added.

JetPac is also doubling down on peak-season readiness by incentivising affiliate partners with competitive commissions and exclusive offerings.

“We [also] offer lounge access at discounted rates whenever a customer purchases a travel e-sim with JetPac,” said Jun Kai, Commercial Lead at JetPac. “We also offer free lounge access if your flight is ever delayed.”

Furness stressed that affiliate and influencer marketing are critical channels during high-traffic seasons. “By partnering with travel-focused content creators and affiliates… brands can stay top of mind and drive repeat bookings through trusted recommendations,” he said.

Data also plays a key role in adjusting peak season strategies on the fly.

“The most successful businesses are leveraging first-party data… integrating that into emerging technologies so they can anticipate travelers’ needs at every touch point,” Furness said. “Machine learning models can predict peak booking periods, adjust pricing, promotions, marketing strategies.”

A multi-pronged brand refresh is a core part of this.","After a streak of dull sales, hair care brand Olaplex is hoping an effort to go back to the roots—literally—will help revitalize it.

Olaplex was founded in 2014, starting in the professional channel at salons before expanding into retail. The company launched on DTC and into specialty retailers like Sephora in 2018, and went public and expanded into Ulta stores in 2021.

The brand has had its struggles since going public, including a since-denied class action lawsuit and slipping sales, particularly in the professional channel. Former Supergoop CEO Amanda Baldwin took over as chief exec in December 2023 to begin a turnaround. In its most recent earnings reported in March, net sales dropped 9.8%, with professional sales down 27.1%, though specialty retail rose 5.7%. On that earnings call, Baldwin introduced the brand’s new “Bonds and Beyond strategic vision,” comprising three pillars: shifting its products and messaging beyond treating damage to “foundational hair health,” fostering its professional business, and creating an “emotional connection” with consumers.

A multi-pronged brand refresh is a core part of this. While Olaplex’s products were designed and marketed to treat damage from hair coloring, CMO Katie Gohman told Retail Brew, lately the company has found that “the visual identity wasn’t really representing everything that the brand could do for both stylists as well as consumers.”

“A great brand has an emotional territory in a world that consumers aspire to be a part of,” Gohman said.

Split ends: This refresh has been in the works for about a year, Gohman said. She joined Olaplex last July, after serving as CMO at Marc Jacobs (her retail résumé also includes Ralph Lauren, Coach, and L’Oréal), and began building out its marketing team, focused on digital, media, and analytics, she said. The company brought on Andrew Reuben, another Ralph Lauren alum, as VP of global digital marketing and media in January, with other recent hires including a director of global digital marketing and media and a digital designer of global creative, per LinkedIn.

“How do you then bring the brand to life and to market? That was a muscle that hadn’t really been built here,” Gohman said.

With the refresh, Olaplex has changed “almost all consumer-facing communication touch points,” she said. That includes a new visual identity with an updated logo, a new website unveiled in February (with user experience and interface redone), and a relaunched social presence.

It has also rolled out updated in-store merchandising with both retail and professional partners, as Gohman said Olaplex had received feedback that its product line was “extremely confusing and people didn’t understand how to shop it.” Now, at retail partners, the first shelf highlights the focus on foundational hair health including its latest product innovation N°0.5 Scalp Longevity Treatment. The next shelves zero in on the wash routine—shampoo, conditioner, and masks—followed by a shelf for styling products like hair oil.

“We worked on what we call internally a product architecture but really is, ‘How does the consumer navigate the line?’ she said. “It was all about really making that journey easier for the consumer.”

Framing the face: That all culminated in a brand campaign released last week featuring the tagline “Designed to Defy,” with a spot featuring actress Nicola Coughlan, fashion designer and former J. Crew president and creative director Jenna Lyons, and Olympic sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone alongside Olaplex pro stylists emphasizing the “confidence” and “endless possibilities” a good hair day presents. This represents a new effort to center stylists in its communications, Gohman said, noting they “help tell our story the best.”

It’s also extending this campaign into an IRL experience—an element younger generations of consumers “demands,” Gohman said—which has come in the form of the Olaplex Bond House in New York City on April 4, a series of events for consumers including a digital hair analysis scan.

With the campaign, beyond just sales, KPIs Gohman is zeroing in on include earned media value (how much people are talking about the brand in media), search interest, and—longer term—brand health (measuring perception and awareness), to ensure the brand is “making progress on our values and on the emotional territory in the spaces that we want to grow.”

The Designed to Defy campaign is a step in creating that emotional connection Baldwin had referenced, Gohman said. The company learned that connection was lacking through field research, asking consumers questions like “What does the brand make you feel?” and recognizing those scores came up short, though she said there was no negative feedback about the products’ efficacy.

“As a marketer and even just a consumer in general, I think you know the brands that you feel something when you see their work or you aspire to be a part of that world, and those that you don’t,” she said.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/18a37dc42391399c35275ce9a8e5f8b798c4bc25-6289x6590.jpg?rect=0,1644,6289,3302&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-08 12:25:00.064026

The company expects its gross margin to expand by 100 basis points (bps), reaching approximately 61.6 per cent, up from a base of 60.6 per cent. The adjusted EBIT margin is projected to rise to between 11.4 and 11.6 per cent YoY, revised upward from the original guidance of 10.9 to 11.1 per cent, which was based on a 10.2 per cent base.

Levi Strauss & Co expects FY25 organic net revenue growth of 3.5–4.5 per cent, with gross margin projected at 61.6 per cent and adjusted EBIT margin at 11.4–11.6 per cent. Q1 FY25 revenue rose 3 per cent (reported) and 9 per cent (organic), with strong DTC and e-commerce growth. Net income reached $140 million, and adjusted EPS rose to $0.38 from $0.25 in Q1 FY24.

The adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) is projected between $1.20 and $1.25, including an estimated $0.20 impact from foreign exchange (FX) and a higher tax rate. The updated outlook excludes any potential impact from the recently announced tariffs, Levi Strauss said in a press release.

In the first quarter (Q1) of 2025, the company generated revenue of $1.5 billion, marking a 3 per cent increase on a reported basis and 9 per cent growth on an organic basis compared to Q1 2024.

The Levi’s brand was up 8 per cent globally on an organic basis. The gross margin increased 330 bps to 62.1 per cent from 58.8 per cent in Q1 2024 primarily driven by lower product costs and favourable channel and brand mix.

Region-wise, Americas net revenues increased 6 per cent on a reported basis and 11 per cent on an organic basis. Within the Americas, the US grew 8 per cent on an organic basis. In Europe, net revenues decreased 5 per cent on a reported basis and increased 3 per cent on an organic basis.

Brand-wise, Beyond Yoga’s net revenues increased 10 per cent on a reported and organic basis.

Channel-wise, direct-to-consumer (DTC) net revenues increased 9 per cent on a reported basis and 12 per cent on an organic basis. DTC growth on an organic basis reflected an 8 per cent increase in the US, an 11 per cent increase in Europe and a 14 per cent increase in Asia.

Net revenues from e-commerce grew 13 per cent on a reported basis and 16 per cent on an organic basis. DTC comprised 52 per cent of total net revenues in the first quarter. Wholesale net revenues decreased 3 per cent on a reported basis and increased 5 per cent on an organic basis.

The operating margin of the company in Q1 2025 was 12.5 per cent compared to 0.04 per cent in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 bps to 13.4 per cent from 9.4 per cent last year on a reported basis primarily due to higher gross margin.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $749 million compared to $756 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted SG&A was up 1.7 per cent to $744 million compared to $731 million last year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was 48.7 per cent compared to 49.4 per cent last year.

The company’s net income from continuing operations was $140 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $10 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted net income was $150 million compared to $100 million in Q1 2024.

Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE: LEVI) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 2, 2025. The following information is based on continuing operations which excludes approximately $67 million of net revenues related to Dockers®.

“We exceeded revenue and profitability expectations in Q1 marking a strong start to the year, another proof point that our transformation strategy is working,” said Michelle Gass, President and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. “The Levi’s® brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the center of culture across the globe. While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond.”

“We delivered significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth in the first quarter, and the strong momentum continued through March,” said Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer of Levi Strauss & Co.“Looking forward, we are maintaining our 2025 top- and bottom-line guidance, which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements, and we anticipate minimal impact to our Q2 margin outlook. In addition, our strong balance sheet, improved structural economics and the underlying strength of our business all give us confidence in our path forward.”

Balance Sheet Review as of March 2, 2025

Cash and cash equivalents were $574 million, while total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion.

Total inventories increased 7% on a dollar basis. We have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for Q2.

Shareholder Returns

The company returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, a 12% increase over prior year, including:

Dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of $0.13 per share.

Share repurchases of $30 million, reflecting 1.6 million shares retired.

As of March 2, 2025, the company had $560 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date.

The company has declared a dividend of $0.13 per share totaling approximately $51 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 9, to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April 24.

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Wastewater management is a critical yet complex challenge for pet food processors. High organic loads, fats and cleaning chemicals create a difficult-to-treat wastewater stream, requiring a combination of physical and biological processes. At the same time, regulatory pressures continue to evolve, increasing compliance costs and adding another layer of complexity to wastewater treatment strategies.

As sustainability goals take center stage, manufacturers are turning to advanced treatment technologies to improve efficiency, reduce costs and minimize their environmental impact. From dissolved air flotation (DAF) systems to digital monitoring tools and water reuse strategies, processors are optimizing wastewater treatment to meet both operational and regulatory demands.

Common challenges

“Pet food processing facilities often encounter a range of wastewater treatment challenges, including proposed regulations mandating nutrient reduction or removal, surcharges that can reduce profitability, and escalating costs for labor, chemicals, as well as energy,” explained Chris Knodel, professional engineer, industrial wastewater manager, Burns & McDonnell, Kansas City, Mo. “Additional hurdles include fluctuating wastewater flows from cleaning cycles, high pollutant concentrations, and the limitations of aging infrastructure.”

Beyond regulatory and infrastructure challenges, operational inefficiencies further complicate wastewater management. These inefficiencies increase wastewater volumes, drive up treatment costs and create additional compliance hurdles. Identifying and addressing them is essential for improving wastewater management and sustainability.

“Common wastewater challenges often stem from improper management of plant-level issues,” said Kunal Mehta of Ecolab.

“Common wastewater challenges often stem from improper management of plant-level issues,” said Kunal Mehta, senior global account manager, enterprise solutions, Ecolab, Saint Paul, Minn. “Valve failure, uncontrolled product losses and excessive water use can all lead to compounding wastewater problems downstream. For example, let’s say the protocol for handling spilled product within a facility is to wash it down the drain. This increases the amount of chemistry required to treat wastewater and risks increasing transportation costs (and emissions) related to transporting effluent and byproducts. In this way, one cleaning and sanitation protocol can directly affect a number of wastewater and other sustainability priorities.”

In addition to these operational inefficiencies, the composition of wastewater itself presents a significant challenge. Pet food processing generates a complex wastewater stream that contains high levels of organic matter, including fats, oils and greases (FOGs), total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). These pollutants require specialized treatment before the wastewater can be safely discharged or reused.

“The biggest challenge is rendering and mixing, as well as using other organic ingredients to produce a finished product in pet food facilities similar to other food processing plants,” said John Richert, industrial sales manager, JWC Environmental, Santa Ana, Calif. “This generates a complex wastewater stream high in TSS, BOD/COD, FOGs, ammonia, and other chemical byproducts that must be treated before they can be sent to a municipal system or released to a surface water source.”

“The biggest challenge is rendering and mixing, as well as using other organic ingredients to produce a finished product in pet food facilities similar to other food processing plants,” said John Richert of JWC Environmental.

Fluctuating wastewater volumes introduce additional challenges to treatment efforts. Cleaning cycles and production variability can create inconsistent flow rates, making it difficult for treatment systems to operate efficiently. Many facilities are also relying on aging wastewater infrastructure that was designed for lower production capacities, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased compliance challenges.

“Plant production demands are very dynamic in the pet food industry, so robust and agile systems must be in place throughout the operation to minimize disruption,” said Eric Bradley, business development director, Hawkins, Inc., Roseville, Minn. “Wastewater infrastructure and equipment are often designed for a different operational pace from five or more years ago. Capital projects are usually slower than a current problem demands and more costly than the business desires.”

Effective treatment solutions

To address these challenges, pet food processors are implementing a range of wastewater treatment technologies designed to improve efficiency and maintain compliance.

“Flow equalization helps regulate fluctuating wastewater volumes, while screening efficiently removes large particles,” Knodel said. “Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is highly effective at eliminating oils and suspended solids. Advanced biological treatment systems, such as membrane bioreactors (MBR), moving bed bioreactors (MBBR) and sequencing batch reactors (SBR), provide efficient nutrient removal. Additionally, dewatering equipment minimizes sludge volume and hauling expenses, while asset management and capital planning strategies enable facilities to budget for component replacements and upgrades effectively.”

A key component of these treatment strategies is the use of Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems, which help remove FOGs and other suspended solids from wastewater streams.

“Wastewater containing very high levels of FOGs can be pretreated with a grease trap to remove free-floating grease. After one (or both) of these pre-treatment methods, the waste stream is sent to a DAF system for further treatment,” explained John O’Hehir, regional sales manager, Kemco Systems, Clearwater, Fla. “Kemco’s DAF is designed to give the maximum operator flexibility and maximum removal of oils, greases, skimmings and solids. Kemco’s DAF technology offers a centrifugal DAF pump. The multi-phase air saturation pump provides maximum air flotation with minimum maintenance cost and upkeep. The Kemco DAF system is available with chemical coagulant/flocculant mix systems designed to optimize the effectiveness of treatment chemicals.”

In addition to physical and biological treatment, digital monitoring tools are playing an increasing role in wastewater management.

“In the area of cleaning and sanitation, digital monitoring products can help facilities optimize the amount of chemistry they’re using to clean and sanitize core equipment,” Mehta said. “Among other things, this optimization directly impacts the quality of wastewater, which can help streamline the facility’s water management strategy and keep them compliant.”

Sustainability benefits

Effective wastewater treatment not only ensures regulatory compliance but also supports broader sustainability initiatives.

“Wastewater treatment solutions help minimize water usage, reduce nutrient discharges to the environment, and support resource recovery by capturing valuable byproducts such as oils, biogas and reusable water,” Knodel said. “Additionally, advanced technologies and automation systems lower power consumption, further bolstering sustainability initiatives.”

Many processors are implementing wastewater treatment strategies that align with their sustainability objectives. Some focus on meeting discharge requirements, while others invest in water reuse technologies to maximize efficiency.

“Sustainability can be measured in varying ways,” O’Hehir said. “For some processes, the ability to achieve local publicly owned treatment works (POTW) discharge limitations utilizing DAF or ceramic membrane filtration (CMF) technologies allows the processor to provide an acceptable effluent. For other processors where reuse is a goal, the CMF/RO combination removes FOGs, suspended solids, viruses and bacteria, microplastics, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and colors and odors. Because this combination of systems relies on physical processes, it can reduce facilities’ chemical costs. Coupled with thermal stability lessening the demand on boilers and reducing natural gas consumption, the CMF/RO combined system is both an economical and environmentally friendly solution for pet food processing wastewater by recycling both water and energy.”

Advanced digital monitoring solutions are also playing a role in sustainability efforts by improving visibility into water management performance. By tracking key metrics in real time, processors can proactively address wastewater issues and optimize cleaning and sanitation practices.

“Ecolab’s 3D TRASAR Technology for CIP (3DT CIP) helps pet food processors achieve sustainability goals while simultaneously supporting better efficiency,” Mehta said. “By arming facility leadership with better visibility into core cleaning and sanitation and water use metrics, 3DT CIP enables them to respond to potential wastewater issues before they become unmanageable.”

Reducing and reusing

As water costs rise and environmental regulations tighten, pet food processors are looking for ways to minimize wastewater and maximize water reuse. Reducing overall water consumption not only helps control operating expenses but also aligns with sustainability goals and regulatory expectations.

“Pet food processors can take several practical steps to reduce wastewater volume and improve water reuse,” Knodel said. “These include making operational changes to cleaning processes, exploring water reuse opportunities such as irrigation, boiler feed and cooling towers, as well as adopting new technologies like reverse osmosis, evaporation and crystallization. These measures can significantly lower the overall water footprint of pet food processing facilities.”

Identifying the right water reuse opportunities starts with evaluating each stage of processing. Understanding where water can be repurposed within the facility helps processors optimize usage while ensuring compliance with quality and safety standards.

“The challenges presented with reusing water are typically determined by where in the overall process reuse of water would be acceptable,” O’Hehir said. “As pet food processors evaluate the overall use of water and generation of wastewater within each stage of processing, they can identify opportunities for internal reuse within the same stage if the water cannot be reused further downstream.”

Reducing wastewater at the source is just as important as finding ways to reuse it. By preventing unnecessary contaminants from entering the wastewater system, pet food processors can lower treatment costs and improve overall efficiency.

“Three contaminants are universally present in the pet food industry and are the primary drivers of cost to treat: fats, oils, and grease (FOG), total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),” Bradley said. “Additional contaminants, such as phosphorus, chlorides, selenium and bacteria load, may also be relevant depending on the site and discharge parameters. Processors should take a fresh look at their systems to find ways to reduce these contaminants before they enter the wastewater stream.

“Reclaim water wherever possible to minimize water volume purchased and wastewater treated,” he added. “Water only needs to be as clean as the use application requires. There may be locations in a plant where one-use water may be fit for a second use, or treated wastewater can be used instead of ‘new’ water.”

Innovations and advancements

As wastewater regulations evolve, pet food processors are turning to automation, digital monitoring and advanced treatment technologies to stay ahead. Investing in these innovations will help optimize efficiency, enhance sustainability, and ensure compliance with stricter environmental standards.

“Innovations and advancements shaping the future of wastewater treatment in the pet food industry include the development of new, cost-competitive technologies for nutrient removal and water reuse, increasing opportunities for resource recovery and emerging incentives to adopt sustainable practices,” Knodel said. “Additional collaborative efforts with stakeholders are also paving the way for more integrated and efficient wastewater management solutions.”

With evolving regulations and increasing environmental concerns, wastewater treatment in the pet food industry will continue to evolve. As compliance standards become more stringent, processors will need to adopt new technologies to meet discharge requirements while maintaining operational efficiency.

“The regulatory landscape drives innovation in this market, and right now there’s a focus on de-nitrification and phosphorus removal,” Richert said. “This will require technologies that are not necessarily new but are new to the industry. Besides these, there will be more demand for further chemical removal associated with pharmaceuticals, for example.”

The next phase of wastewater treatment will focus on solutions that are more efficient, adaptable, and responsive to regulatory and economic pressures. Processors that stay informed about industry advancements and build strong partnerships with suppliers will be best positioned to navigate these changes.

“For the next five years, the demands of the pet food industry will drive focus to a few key factors in wastewater treatment chemistry: impact, versatility and safety,” Bradley said. “The most useful advancements will accomplish more with less and respond quickly to operational, regulatory and economic dynamics. To maximize the value of suppliers supporting an operation, develop a deeper compliance partnership with each key supplier to a wastewater plant.”",https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/ext/resources/Articles/2025/04April/040825_Wastewater-treatment_Lead.jpg?height=635&t=1744113770&width=1200,N,,2025-04-08 13:10:26.326220

Ather Energy recently concluded the second edition of its All-India Firmware Development Challenge — ByteBattles 2.0 — at its corporate office in Bengaluru. Centred around the theme of safety in electric two-wheelers, the 30-hour firmware hackathon brought together over 700 engineers, developers, and students from across the country to work on real-world safety solutions.

The event, held on 5th and 6th April, 2025, was sponsored by Qualcomm, Elektrobit, NXP, and Infineon. This year’s challenge revolved around Ather’s in-house developed Ather Software Development Kit (ASDK), an API designed to build embedded vehicle firmware supporting motor control, battery protection, regenerative braking and more, the company said in a media release.

ByteBattles 2.0 saw registrations from 179 teams comprising 722 participants from premier institutes and organisations including IIT-Madras, NIT Warangal, IISC, Manipal, Zoom, Stellantis, Capgemini, Elektrobit and Nosh Robotics.

The finalists — 12 teams — were selected after a rigorous online preliminary round and competed overnight at Ather’s premises to build firmware solutions that improve ride safety, such as obstacle detection, terrain analysis and advanced vehicle function control.

Swapnil Jain, co-founder and CTO of Ather Energy, commented, “Two-wheeler safety is as much about software as it is about hardware. ByteBattles 2.0 was about bringing together engineers and developers to experiment with ASDK and build real-world safety solutions.""

""Vehicle firmware comes with unique constraints — it's about solving for real-time performance, reliability, and efficiency. We believe the best way to drive innovation is to get hands-on, test ideas, and push boundaries, and it was great to see participants do exactly that.”

The company said that it has been actively working on improving safety in its products. The 2025 Ather 450 includes multi-mode traction control, while the Rizta electric scooter features SkidControl, designed to reduce the risk of skidding on slippery surfaces.

Other safety enhancements include FallSafe, which cuts motor power in the event of a fall, and Emergency Stop Signal, which rapidly flashes the tail lights during sudden braking. A recent AtherStack 6 update also introduced a Live Location Sharing feature to enhance rider security.

The hackathon had a total prize pool of ₹2,00,000 and aimed to foster collaboration and skill-building in the embedded systems and automotive software development community.

Joyner, who took over as the company’s CEO less than six months ago, announced a “chief financial officer transition plan,” naming Brian Newman, who is 56 years old, as “executive vice president and chief financial officer designate, effective April 21.” Newman was most recently executive vice president and chief financial officer of United Parcel Service. “In his nearly five years of leadership, he delivered results that supported employees, customers, and communities, in particular helping lead the company through COVID-19 pandemic,” CVS said of Newman’s work at UPS.

Newman will succeed current chief financial officer, Tom Cowhey, 52, who will transition to serve as a strategic advisor to Joyner, effective May 12, the company announced Tuesday.

In addition, CVS said Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, 61, is the company’s new executive vice president and chief medical officer, effective May 19. Compton-Phillips, who also reports to Joyner, was most recently chief physician executive of Press Ganey, a health care performance improvement company. “She has an extensive background in directing patient care programs and leading health care organizations to broad-based improvements,” CVS said.

“As I continue to build out my leadership team, I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue the momentum we have built over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better health care to the 185 million Americans we are privileged to serve,” Joyner said Tuesday. “Their collective and individual experience and expertise are well suited to CVS Health and we welcome them both to our leadership team.""

Joyner’s new executive picks are the first major executive moves since since he was promoted last October to replace Karen S. Lynch, who stepped down. CVS has struggled to control costs in its Aetna health insurance businesses and its retail pharmacies have struggled.

But CVS also said Tuesday financial progress is being made.

“Based on year-to-date results through February, the company currently expects financial results will meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for full year 2025,” CVS announced Tuesday along with the new executive appointments. “Our financial closing procedures for the first quarter of 2025 are not yet complete and, as a result, expected results for the full year may change due to such financial closing procedures, final adjustments, management’s review of results, and other developments that may arise between now and the time our financial results for the first quarter of 2025 are finalized.”

As the Q4 earnings season wraps, let’s dig into this quarter’s best and worst performers in the apparel and accessories industry, including Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) and its peers.

Thanks to social media and the internet, not only are styles changing more frequently today than in decades past but also consumers are shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some apparel and accessories companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.

The 16 apparel and accessories stocks we track reported a strong Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.5% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.

Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 17.7% since the latest earnings results.

""Our teams around the world executed very well across geographies, channels, and categories this holiday to deliver on our long-term, Next Great Chapter: Accelerate strategy,"" said Patrice Louvet, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Ralph Lauren achieved the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street’s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts’ consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 19.3% since reporting and currently trades at $200.91.

Market Update

In response to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.

Figures from information provider Dealogic suggest that investment banking fees earned globally by UBS have fallen 23% in year-to-date 2025 versus the same period of 2024. At Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, they're up 5% and 6% respectively over the same period.

UBS's investment banking performance wouldn't look great in any circumstance, but it looks even worse in the context of the Credit Suisse acquisition, which reportedly resulted in the addition of 200 ""senior dealmakers."" The new bankers don't appear to have made much difference, yet.

UBS's poor banking performance comes as investment banking activity falters in the wake of Trump's tariffs. Even before the tariffs were imposed, Dealogic says investment banking fee revenues fell 3% year-on-year globally in the first quarter, with the biggest drops in Europe and Latin America (-15% and -21% respectively), and increases in North America and South East Asia (up 2% and 12%).

Job cuts are likely to ensue. UBS isn't commenting, but as we reported first last week, the Swiss bank is planning a new round of cuts later this month. Insiders at UBS, told Bloomberg that lists are already being drawn up of whom to let go. Insiders tells us they're based on recent performance appraisals, in which people were marked down unusually harshly. There are claims that ex-Credit Suisse people seemed to come off worse.

As revenues stagnate, though, the hope is that some UBS people will simply walk away. ""The ideal is for people to leave of their own accords,"" says one insider, adding that ""a deliberately uncomfortable work environment,"" is one way of prompting this.

Another option is to offer voluntary redundancy payments, which some at UBS say would be perfect now. ""A lot of people have lost their motivation,"" says one insider at the bank, who complains of a ""bad vibe."" He says he would accept voluntary redundancy if it were offered: ""I'd like to leave soon, as these kinds of cuts isn't what I signed up for.""

CVS Health has appointed Brian Newman to the role of chief financial officer, effective April 21, and said that it expects to meet or exceed its latest guidance for the year.

Newman brings to the health solutions company a wealth of experience, most recently serving as executive vice president and CFO of United Parcel Service.

Prior to his time at UPS, Newman was at PepsiCo where he spent the majority of his career. He served for 26 years in finance leadership roles across Europe, Asia and South America, and was executive vice president for PepsiCo's global operations and as chief strategy officer.

Newman takes over the reins from Tom Cowhey, who will transition to a strategic advisory role, supporting Chief Executive Officer David Joyner, effective May 12.

Newman is expected to receive an annual salary of $1 million and will be eligible for a bonus of 150% of his salary based on performance. He's also set to receive an equity award of $7 million made up of a mix of performance stock units, restricted stocks units and stock options.

Additionally, CVS has appointed Amy Compton-Phillips to the role of chief medical officer, effective May 19. Compton-Phillips was most recently chief physician executive of health care performance improvement company Press Ganey, and before that, chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services, a health care system.

In November of last year, CVS shuffled its top executive, bringing in Joyner to head the company in place of Karen Lynch in response to a push for changes by Glenview Capital Management, a major hedge fund, and a board review of strategy that included the option of breaking up the company.

At the time, the company also warned again that its earnings for the year would miss expectations.

On Tuesday, CVS said that it now CVS said it currently expects financial performance will meet or exceed its most recent guidance for full year 2025 based on year-to-date results through February. In February, the company set guidance for adjusted earnings of $5.75 to $6 a share for 2025.

Analysts polled on FactSet expect adjusted earnings of $5.90 a share.

During the quarter ending 2 March 2025, the company’s Levi’s brand witnessed an 8% surge in global organic net revenues.

Regionally, the Americas and Asia experienced growth in net revenues by 6% and 7% respectively, while Europe saw a decline in net revenues by 5%.

The company’s direct-to-consumer channels contributed positively with a 9% ascent in net revenues. Wholesale channels faced a downturn with a 3% reduction in net revenues.

A significant turnaround was evident in the company’s profitability, with net income from continuing operations reaching $140m in Q1 FY25, compared to a net loss of $10m in the same period of the previous year.

The rebound was reflected in earnings per share from continuing operations, which stood at $0.35, up from a diluted loss per share of $0.03 in Q1 FY24.

Levi Strauss’ operational efficiency improvements were underscored by an expansion in operating margin to 12.5% and an increase in gross margin of 330 basis points to 62.1%.

The growth in gross margin was attributed mainly to reduced product costs and an advantageous mix of channels and brands.

Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin also saw a substantial improvement, climbing by 400 basis points to reach 13.4%, propelled by the enhanced gross margin.

Levi Strauss saw a marginal drop in selling, general and administrative expenses to $749m over the quarter from $756m reported in the first quarter of the previous year.

The company reclassified the Dockers business as discontinued operations in Q1 FY25.

Levi Strauss & Co president and CEO Michelle Gass stated: “We exceeded revenue and profitability expectations in Q1, marking a strong start to the year – another proof point that our transformation strategy is working.

“The Levi’s brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the centre of culture across the globe. While we recognise that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond.”

Levi Strauss has maintained guidance for fiscal 2025 based on continuing operations, excluding the impact of the recent tariffs.

The company anticipates a slight decline in reported net revenue, ranging between 1% and 2%.

Expectations for gross margin are nevertheless optimistic, with an anticipated expansion of 100 basis points to 61.6%.

The adjusted EBIT margin is projected to widen to between 11.4% and 11.6%, representing an increase of 70 to 90 basis points from the base of 10.7%.",https://www.retail-insight-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/04/store-shutterstock_1353546698.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 11:11:01.752279

Tariffs this, tariffs that. Sneakerheads and runners are just wondering how much more their shoes are going to cost because of them.

According to the senior vice president of a federal footwear trade organization, a $155 running shoe could jump to as much as $220. But don’t unlace those runners yet, because other projections are a bit softer, projecting that a Nike Pegasus 41, currently $140, could go up to $157.

Regardless of exactly how much more expensive shoes will be, the hefty tariffs on the countries that manufacture the majority of the country’s footwear come at a less-than-desirable time for the industry leader, Nike.

Nike needs its fans to buy a lot of shoes in the coming months, and even without tariffs, Nike customers were already going to be seeing higher prices than what they were used to for the last few years.

Starbucks has reiterated its commitment to the UK market after reporting significant losses and revenue decline last year.

The world’s largest coffee chain posted a £35.2m ($44.8m) loss before tax in the UK for the 12 months ended 29 September 2024, compared to a £16.9m ($21.5m) profit the year previously. Starbucks also reported a 9% fall in gross profit and a 4% year-on-year fall in UK revenues to £525.6m ($668.9m).

In commentary accompanying its results, Starbucks said a challenging trading environment, including high raw material costs, softer consumer spending and ‘widely discussed misperceptions’ about the chain’s stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict, had negatively impacted its performance.

Starbucks also highlighted the UK’s ‘highly competitive’ branded coffee shop market as a factor in reduced footfall to its stores, with increased investment in domestic specialty coffee chains challenging the local trading landscape.

World Coffee Portal’s Project Café UK 2025 report shows specialty operators WatchHouse, Black Sheep Coffee, Knoops, Redemption Roasters and BEAR all raised investment over the last 12 months to fund UK expansion.

The UK remains Starbucks’ largest market in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. The Seattle-based coffee chain ended the year with 1,240 stores, an addition of 100 net new sites, and has since acquired its largest UK franchisee, 23.5 Degrees, adding a further 113 stores to its company-owned UK estate.

Starbucks expects to open a further 80 net new UK stores by the end of September 2025, retaining a focus on key drive-thru and high-footfall city centre locations.

“It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macro-economic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence. Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK. We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year,” said Duncan Moir, President, Starbucks EMEA.

Starbucks UK profits during the period were also impacted by ongoing investments in technology, social media and its Starbucks Rewards loyalty programme, as well as increases in staff wages.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme, and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time,” Moir added.",https://www.worldcoffeeportal.com/getattachment/58493c2d-8c46-4e85-a42e-ab038493ebfe/Starbucks_UK_focused_on_‘regaining_momentum’_after_posting_£35.2m_loss.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 10:06:59.670461

Brian Newman has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer designate, effective April 21, and will take over from the current CFO, Tom Cowhey, on May 12. Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as the new executive vice president and chief medical officer on May 19.

Brian Newman, the incoming CFO, previously served as the CFO of United Parcel Service (UPS) and brings a wealth of experience from a nearly three-decade career at PepsiCo. Newman’s leadership at UPS during the COVID-19 pandemic and his tenure in various global finance roles at PepsiCo position him as a strategic addition to the CVS Health leadership team. According to InvestingPro analysis, CVS currently appears undervalued, with multiple analysts recently revising their earnings expectations upward for the upcoming period.

Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips arrives with a distinguished background in healthcare management, most recently as the chief physician executive at Press Ganey. Her prior roles include president and chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services and various positions at Kaiser Permanente. Her appointment underscores CVS Health’s commitment to clinical excellence and patient care.

The company also signaled confidence in its financial trajectory, expecting to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for the full year of 2025. With a healthy 4.17% dividend yield and strong recent market performance, CVS has demonstrated resilience in the healthcare sector. It is important to note that the financial closing procedures for the first quarter are not yet complete, and final figures may be subject to change.

David Joyner, president and CEO of CVS Health, expressed gratitude to Tom Cowhey for his contributions and welcomed the new executives, emphasizing their potential to propel the company’s strategic vision. Newman and Compton-Phillips also shared their enthusiasm for their new roles, highlighting their commitment to the success and health outcomes of CVS Health’s clients and customers.

These leadership transitions come as CVS Health continues to expand its healthcare services, which include a vast network of retail pharmacy locations, medical clinics, pharmacy benefits management, and health insurance products. For deeper insights into CVS Health’s valuation and growth prospects, investors can access comprehensive analysis and additional ProTips through InvestingPro’s detailed research reports, which are available for over 1,400 US stocks.

The information for this article is based on a press release statement from CVS Health.

In other recent news, CVS Health has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, payable on May 1, 2025, to shareholders of record by April 22, 2025. This decision highlights the company’s commitment to delivering value to its investors. Additionally, Mizuho Securities has increased its price target for CVS Health to $70 from $58, maintaining an Outperform rating. The analyst, Ann Hynes, cited the company’s ""embedded earnings power"" as a factor in the revised target, reflecting confidence in CVS Health’s financial strength.

In a broader industry context, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a 5.06% increase in Medicare insurer payment rates for 2026, benefiting companies like CVS Health. This rate adjustment is expected to generate over $25 billion in additional revenue for the healthcare insurance sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to resume its lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Health’s CVS Caremark, over insulin pricing practices. The case had been paused due to the recusal of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who has now reversed his decision, allowing proceedings to continue.

Lastly, the FDA has authorized Visby Medical’s at-home test for three sexually transmitted diseases, with CVS among companies offering similar at-home testing kits.

Combined, Kroger and Albertsons operate nearly 5,000 stores and employ hundreds of thousands of workers across the United States.
Meanwhile, both Kroger and Albertsons have quietly begun reducing headcount, further highlighting the instability created by the failed merger.
“The real tragedy of this failed merger is that the logic behind it was sound,” said one retail consultant.
“Without scale, supermarkets like Kroger and Albertsons may slowly lose ground to more agile, tech-savvy competitors.” What’s Next for Kroger?","In a move that has stunned retail analysts and rattled the grocery industry, Kroger has disclosed it spent over $1 billion in a failed bid to acquire rival supermarket chain Albertsons — an ambitious merger that regulators ultimately blocked, yet one whose ripple effects continue to be felt across the U.S. food retail landscape.

The Cincinnati-based retail giant revealed in a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that the proposed $25 billion merger with Albertsons, first announced in October 2022, has cost the company dearly. The breakdown of the billion-dollar loss shows $684 million spent in 2024 alone, primarily on third-party legal and advisory fees, alongside $316 million in 2023 and $44 million in 2022.

A Costly Gamble on Consolidation

The failed merger was one of the most expensive attempted consolidations in recent grocery retail history. The strategic rationale behind Kroger’s bid was clear: uniting with Albertsons would create a supermarket powerhouse capable of competing with giants like Walmart and Amazon. Combined, Kroger and Albertsons operate nearly 5,000 stores and employ hundreds of thousands of workers across the United States.

But regulators weren’t convinced. Antitrust lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and attorneys general from multiple states argued the merger would reduce competition, potentially increase grocery prices, and result in widespread job losses. Court proceedings stretched from Seattle to Portland throughout late 2024, culminating in two separate court rulings in December that blocked the deal. Albertsons officially terminated the merger a day later.

More Than Just Legal Fees

Kroger’s billion-dollar bill was not limited to lawyer invoices. The grocer had also secured expensive credit facilities to finance the deal and had entered into agreements with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had planned to purchase nearly 600 stores as part of a divestiture plan to appease regulators. Following the collapse, C&S filed a lawsuit in Delaware, demanding a termination fee.

Albertsons, for its part, wasted no time retaliating — suing Kroger for damages, alleging the Ohio-based chain failed to secure regulatory approval in good faith.

Leadership Shake-Ups and Job Cuts

The fallout hasn’t just been financial. In March, Kroger’s long-serving CEO Rodney McMullen resigned amid an internal investigation into conduct that reportedly violated the company’s code of ethics. Former Staples CEO and Kroger board member Ron Sargent has stepped in as interim chief while a permanent replacement is sought.

Meanwhile, both Kroger and Albertsons have quietly begun reducing headcount, further highlighting the instability created by the failed merger.

A Merger Still Needed for Long-Term Survival?

While the merger is legally dead, analysts warn that its economic and strategic necessity remains very much alive. Both Kroger and Albertsons face growing pressure from online players like Amazon Fresh, warehouse giants such as Costco, and discount-driven newcomers like Aldi and Lidl. The grocery sector is undergoing seismic change, and consolidation is seen by many insiders as not just a growth strategy, but a matter of survival.

Some experts argue that without consolidation, traditional supermarket chains may struggle to keep prices low while managing razor-thin margins in a high-inflation environment.

“The real tragedy of this failed merger is that the logic behind it was sound,” said one retail consultant. “Without scale, supermarkets like Kroger and Albertsons may slowly lose ground to more agile, tech-savvy competitors.”

What’s Next for Kroger?

As Kroger begins picking up the pieces of its abandoned merger, it remains to be seen how the company will redirect its resources. With over 409,000 employees nationwide and 76 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky alone, the grocer still has a significant national footprint.

However, with a billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet and mounting legal costs, strategic missteps are no longer affordable.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-isn_corporation_logo-1-32x32.webp,N,,2025-04-08 08:04:44.801575

According to the company’s report, the Osun-based brewer saw its losses balloon to N113.6 billion in 2024 from N70 billion it recorded in the previous year, rising by 62.5 percent.

The brewer had been on a losing streak since 2018 when it recorded a loss of N3.87 billion. And the loss jumped almost five-fold to N27.79 billion in 2019 and contracted to N16.08 billion in 2020. The company’s loss slightly rose again to N17.66 billion in 2021 and even higher to N21.63 billion in 2022.

The recurring losses stem from the brewer’s exposure to foreign exchange which became volatile after the government unified the exchange rate and devalued the naira, leading to about a 70 percent slump of the currency.

Meanwhile, revenue continues to shoot up, reaching a nine-year high and almost doubled in the financial year ended 31 December 2024, indicating strong revenue growth.

Its revenue grew from N260.5 billion in 2023 to N488.9 billion last year, highlighting how the firm has been able to adjust to the shocks witnessed in the last two years.

“While continually delivering strong revenue growth, our inability to source adequate foreign exchange due to market illiquidity impacts profitability, as we incurred significant FX losses on our foreign currency-denominated debt and liabilities,” the beer maker said in its financial statement.

“To address this, the company successfully raised fresh capital through a rights issue and settled the outstanding loan liability. Going into 2025, the company expects to return to profitability in the absence of any significant non-operating foreign currency exposure,” it added.

The firm continues to grapple with FX-induced losses as its unrealised foreign exchange loss for the year stood at N128.4 billion while the brewers realised foreign exchange loss jumped to N294.1 billion from N14.3 billion in 2023.

Beer makers make use of raw materials such as barley, hops which are largely imported. This meant sourcing and scarce FX, leading to higher input cost in terms of raw materials.

The firm spent more than double to source raw materials in 2024 as cost surged from N25.6 billion in 2023 to N58.14 billion last year.

Obi Achebe, chairman of the board of directors at International Breweries Plc, said in a statement that the repayment of the company’s foreign exchange-denominated loans would propel the firm back to the path of sustainable profitability.

“We are proud of the strides we have made in strengthening our business foundation and positioning for sustainable growth. The repayment of our outstanding $379.9 million loan, enabled by our parent company, AB InBev has bolstered our financial position.

“This recapitalisation not only strengthens our balance sheet but also sets the stage for long-term profitability and growth. We are now better equipped to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency, and seize new opportunities.”

International Breweries opened its N588 billion rights issue programme on May 21, 2024, where the brewer seeks to issue 161,172,395,100 new ordinary shares of 2 kobo each at an offer price of N3.65 per share.

According to a recent statement by the brewer, Achebe also commended the company’s progress, particularly after its rights issue, which enabled the repayment of its forex-denominated loan, which had impacted the company over the years.

“The elimination of our FX exposure will improve IBPLC’s cash flows and will support the company’s return to profitability.

The company has officially launched its Denza brand in Europe, aiming to grow its footprint in the region and challenge established luxury manufacturers. The first model to hit European streets will be the Z9 GT, with sales expected to begin by the end of the year.

Denza was originally formed as a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes-Benz back in 2011. But despite the star power behind it, the brand struggled to gain traction, selling just 23,000 vehicles in its first decade. Mercedes-Benz began scaling back its involvement in 2022, reducing its stake to just 10 percent before fully exiting the partnership last year. Denza is now entirely under BYD’s control.

The Chinese maker launched the Denza brand at a special event in Milan, Italy, earlier this week. According to BYD’s special advisor for Europe, Alfredo Altavilla, Denza will target traditional premium car buyers and younger customers with a keen focus on technology.

Back in China, BYD operates Denza alongside two other premium sub-brands, Fang Cheng Bao and Yangwang. According to ArenaEV, BYD plans to consolidate Fang Cheng Bao into the Denza lineup for Europe, starting with the Fang Cheng Bao Leopard 5, which will be rebadged as a Denza. It remains unclear whether Yangwang models will also be brought under the Denza umbrella for the European market.

Denza has not announced prices for its European lineup. However, while speaking with Reuters, Altavilla said the Z9 GT will be followed up by the luxurious D9 van at the end of the year. Both models will be built in and exported from China, even though the automaker plans to start building cars at its new plant in Hungary from October.

On paper, the Z9 GT is aimed at the likes of Porsche’s Taycan Sport Turismo, though it beats the German EV on size. It’s over 7.8 inches (200 mm) longer and rides on a wheelbase that’s 8.8 inches (225 mm) longer. Power comes from three electric motors producing a combined 952 horsepower, fed by a 100.1 kWh lithium-iron phosphate battery pack. In China, the company also offers a PHEV version that combines a 2.0-liter turbo engine and three electric motors for 858 hp.

The Z9 GT’s performance numbers may place it in the same conversation as Porsche’s offerings, but its pricing in China suggests a very different customer base. There, Denza’s model is priced between 334,800 and 414,800 yuan (roughly $45,800 to $56,800), while Porsche’s comparable models, like the Panamera Sport Turismo and Taycan Cross Turismo, start around 1,008,000 yuan ($138,000) and stretch well beyond 1,500,000 yuan ($205,000), depending on trim and powertrain.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Denza-Z9-GT-01.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:23:25.306233

These developments are shaping the landscape for CVS Health and its industry peers, with implications for future operations and investor considerations.","WOONSOCKET, R.I. - CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), a healthcare giant with $370.66 billion in revenue and an $80.5 billion market capitalization, today announced significant changes to its executive team and provided an optimistic outlook for its 2025 financial performance. Brian Newman has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer designate, effective April 21, and will take over from the current CFO, Tom Cowhey, on May 12. Amy Compton-Phillips, M.D., will join the company as the new executive vice president and chief medical officer on May 19.

Brian Newman, the incoming CFO, previously served as the CFO of United Parcel Service (UPS) and brings a wealth of experience from a nearly three-decade career at PepsiCo. Newman’s leadership at UPS during the COVID-19 pandemic and his tenure in various global finance roles at PepsiCo position him as a strategic addition to the CVS Health leadership team. According to InvestingPro analysis, CVS currently appears undervalued, with multiple analysts recently revising their earnings expectations upward for the upcoming period.

Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips arrives with a distinguished background in healthcare management, most recently as the chief physician executive at Press Ganey. Her prior roles include president and chief clinical officer at Providence Health & Services and various positions at Kaiser Permanente. Her appointment underscores CVS Health’s commitment to clinical excellence and patient care.

The company also signaled confidence in its financial trajectory, expecting to meet or exceed its previously issued guidance for the full year of 2025. With a healthy 4.17% dividend yield and strong recent market performance, CVS has demonstrated resilience in the healthcare sector. It is important to note that the financial closing procedures for the first quarter are not yet complete, and final figures may be subject to change.

David Joyner, president and CEO of CVS Health, expressed gratitude to Tom Cowhey for his contributions and welcomed the new executives, emphasizing their potential to propel the company’s strategic vision. Newman and Compton-Phillips also shared their enthusiasm for their new roles, highlighting their commitment to the success and health outcomes of CVS Health’s clients and customers.

These leadership transitions come as CVS Health continues to expand its healthcare services, which include a vast network of retail pharmacy locations, medical clinics, pharmacy benefits management, and health insurance products. For deeper insights into CVS Health’s valuation and growth prospects, investors can access comprehensive analysis and additional ProTips through InvestingPro’s detailed research reports, which are available for over 1,400 US stocks.

The information for this article is based on a press release statement from CVS Health.

In other recent news, CVS Health has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share, payable on May 1, 2025, to shareholders of record by April 22, 2025. This decision highlights the company’s commitment to delivering value to its investors. Additionally, Mizuho Securities has increased its price target for CVS Health to $70 from $58, maintaining an Outperform rating. The analyst, Ann Hynes, cited the company’s ""embedded earnings power"" as a factor in the revised target, reflecting confidence in CVS Health’s financial strength.

In a broader industry context, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a 5.06% increase in Medicare insurer payment rates for 2026, benefiting companies like CVS Health. This rate adjustment is expected to generate over $25 billion in additional revenue for the healthcare insurance sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is set to resume its lawsuit against pharmacy benefit managers, including CVS Health’s CVS Caremark, over insulin pricing practices. The case had been paused due to the recusal of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who has now reversed his decision, allowing proceedings to continue.

Lastly, the FDA has authorized Visby Medical’s at-home test for three sexually transmitted diseases, with CVS among companies offering similar at-home testing kits. These developments are shaping the landscape for CVS Health and its industry peers, with implications for future operations and investor considerations.

Total UK corporation tax charge: $37.5m (FY23: $36.4m)

UK FY24 Operational Updates:

Modest decrease in revenue due to various macro-economic and consumer headwinds. This, coupled with inflationary pressures from commodities such as dairy and cocoa, and investment in our partners’ wages, has created a challenging trading environment.

Despite this, the Company opened 100 new stores, demonstrating a commitment to the region. The Company also plans to open an additional 80 new stores in FY25 in the UK.

The Company invested in digitalization and technology and enhanced its loyalty program by running innovative and engaging campaigns, such as collaborations with the Harry Kane Foundation and Stanley cup. These campaigns contributed to 35% growth in the program’s active members.

The Company’s long-term strategy in the region is aligned to the Global Back to Starbucks strategy, which will see it refocusing on what has always set Starbucks apart — being a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas.

Duncan Moir, President Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa, commented:

“It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macro-economic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence. Despite this, we achieved our goal of opening 100 new stores in the UK.

“We remain committed to further expanding our presence and are today announcing that we will open an additional 80 stores in the UK this year.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards program, and further optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.

“Our success starts and ends with our green apron partners. We would like to thank our over 48,000 partners across EMEA for their hard work in continuing to exceed customer expectations. Together, we are working on delivering growth and ultimately, getting Back to Starbucks.”

UK Overview

The UK remains the Company’s largest market in EMEA. UK operations are captured in the accounts of Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) Limited.

The Company ended the year with a total of 1,240 stores in the UK. Of these, 378 were company-operated stores and 862 were run by licensees – a 30/70 split approximately, which is flat on last year.

The macro-economic and consumer environment dampened consumer demand and Starbucks saw a 4% decline in revenue. Revenue for the period was £525.6m (2023: £547.7m). The Company experienced inflationary pressures on margins from increased input costs such as commodity prices and wage inflation. This led to an operating loss of £27.5m (2023: profit of £21.7m) for the period.

UK Market Trends

The UK coffee market experienced significant headwinds in the financial year which resulted in many consumers adjusting usual spending habits. The cost-of-living pressures accelerated during the period as persistent inflation and higher interest rates left consumers with less disposable income. Widely discussed misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East impacted footfall in some locations in the first half of the year. The UK coffee market has also become highly competitive with new entrants and localised specialty coffee houses investing in new stores.

While the coffee inflationary pressures we observed in 2023 somewhat eased during the fiscal year, higher cost impacts on dairy and cocoa were felt in FY24 which continued to put pressure on margins. Profitability was also impacted by wage inflation as the Company continues to invest in its partners.

Making Starbucks the best job in retail is core to the Back to Starbucks strategy. The Company remains confident that it is heading into FY25 in a strong position to attract and retain key partners for its stores. Further incentives and benefits were provided in the year, including but not limited to salary increases, bonuses and tenure pay. The Company launched a new bonus scheme for store supervisors and baristas, which allows green-apron partners to share in the Company’s success on a more sustainable basis.

During the period, the Company continued to place a strong emphasis on digitalization and technology, enhancing its loyalty program by running innovative and engaging campaigns including collaborations with the Harry Kane Foundation and Stanley cup. These activations led to an increase in customer spend and 35% growth in the program’s active members. The Company will continue to build upon this in 2025 through the rollout of further digital initiatives.

The Company has responded to changing consumer preferences and economic conditions by actively managing its menu offerings and pricing strategies. The trial of freshly baked in-store food products has proved promising and will continue to be rolled out across more stores into FY25 to support consumer convenience. Selected strategic price increases were taken in line with rising input costs.

The Company continued its expansion strategy, delivering on its commitment to open 100 new stores in the UK. New store openings were targeted in key drive-thru and city locations with high traffic and footfall counts.

UK Corporation Tax

The Company reported a UK corporation tax charge of £1.0m (FY23: £7.2m). This reduction reflects the weaker financial performance for the period.

UK FY25 Updates

On the 14 October 2024, Starbucks Corporation acquired 23.5 Degrees Limited, the brand’s largest local licensing operator in the UK, bringing an additional 113 stores under Company Operated Ownership in the UK. This acquisition supports the brand’s growth strategy in the UK and reflects the continued confidence in the market’s long-term outlook. It is anticipated that these stores will be integrated into the Company in due course.

Further to this, the Company plans to open an additional 80 stores in the UK in FY25. Company operated growth in FY25 will prioritize new smaller store format innovation in town locations, drive-thrus, as well as high traffic count locations stores across the United Kingdom.

EMEA Overview

Starbucks EMEA Ltd is the main reporting entity for all Starbucks activities in EMEA – excluding the UK business, which is reported separately, as outlined above.

At the year end, there were 4,862 stores in 42 markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (2023: 4,582 stores).

Starbucks continues to pursue its core strategy of a mostly licensed and franchised operating model in the EMEA region, meaning most of its revenues come primarily from royalty payments. Revenue decreased by 8.8% in the period to $388.0m (2023: $425.4m), driven by the challenging macro-economic backdrop and misperceptions about the brand relating to events in the Middle East.

This was compounded by a slight increase in administrative costs to $152.3m (2023: $147.2m), driven by increased headcount, additional activity supporting expansion across EMEA such as marketing, technology and digital support costs, and unfavorable foreign exchange movements.

Profit after tax for the period was $77.1m (2023: $104.7m). This consists of a profit before tax of $114.6m (2023: $141.1m) and a UK corporation tax charge of $37.5m (2023: $36.4m).

EMEA Market Trends

In support of its broader strategy, the Company continued to grow in the region. During the period, it opened 421 new stores. The Company will continue to expand its presence in the region in support of further growth, with plans to open 150 stores in the region (excluding the UK) next year.

As outlined by Brian Niccol in February 2025, the Company expects to work with its partners in the Middle East to open approximately 500 new stores over the next five years.

EMEA corporation tax

Starbucks EMEA Limited reported a UK corporation tax charge of $37.5m for the year, compared to $36.4m for the same period last year.

The company also reported quarterly profits that were above Wall Street targets, which caused its shares to rise more than 7 per cent in after-hours trading.

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have raised worries about sudden price increases for goods like apparel and footwear as well as a worldwide recession.

The business stated in January that it would be able to cross-source products thanks to a varied supply chain spanning 25 nations.

Levi’s officials have said that the company only imports around 1 per cent of its goods straight from China into the United States, compared to roughly 5 per cent for Mexico. According to President and Chief Executive Michelle Gass, one of the mitigating steps the company is considering is raising prices, which was described as “surgical.”

Demand for slim and wide-legged jeans has held steady, following competitors like Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap, even if consumers are frugal with their discretionary spending.

The company also stated that it was examining the effects of tariffs and what it could do to lessen those effects in its quarterly filing with regulators.

The company stated that it expected the new tariffs to have a material impact on the results of operations in the 2025 fiscal year. Additionally, it stated that production and distribution could be impacted by the environment.

If these disruptions continue, it might be necessary to change present sourcing procedures, which could affect product costs and, if left unchecked, could have a materially negative impact on the company’s operations and business outcomes, it stated.

During a post-earnings call, CFO Harmit Singh stated that the (tariff) impacts are uncertain, given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented.",https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levi-Strauss-maintains-yearly-sales-and-profit-predictions-amid-tariffs.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 06:04:17.064407

“I think McDonald’s is probably the worst when it comes to sexual harassment.” Making sure employees feel safe reporting sexual harassment is essential to combating it, experts say.","Rosalia Manuel had worked for McDonald’s for more than 20 years when she was suddenly fired in 2022. Until then, she had been considered “the best employee,” she said, and had worked her way up to shift manager at a location in Saratoga, California. It was a role she took seriously.

That March, after a coworker confided to her that a different shift manager had been following her around, making suggestive comments, and coming on to her, Manuel reported the behavior to the store manager above her. Manuel had never been trained on how to respond to incidents of sexual harassment, she said, but she felt that it was her responsibility to do something.

The shift manager who had been harassing Manuel’s coworker never appeared to receive any discipline. Instead, in July, the store manager suspended Manuel for a week for allegedly failing to take her lunch break on time. When Manuel returned to work, she was told she was being fired for insubordination, according to a complaint she filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Manuel had a different theory. She called the McDonald’s corporate human resources hotline to complain that she had been fired for reporting sexual harassment. She was told they would investigate, she said, but she never heard back.

The harasser, however, kept working for McDonald’s. In the fall of 2022, at another McDonald’s location in San Jose, the woman began telling Sindy Pamela Mejia, a new employee, that she had a nice body. According to a complaint Mejia has filed with the California Civil Rights Department, she would simulate sex acts, talk about her sex life, and say things like “Ay, qué rico”: How delicious. She quizzed Mejia about whether she had a husband or a boyfriend, Mejia told me. When Mejia rebuffed her, the woman started bullying her, she said, making fun of her for speaking Spanish and for being Honduran.

Mejia didn’t know what she was supposed to do. When she started working at McDonald’s, she was required to watch several onboarding videos. Two of the videos, each about a minute long, advised employees not to touch each other and to say “Excuse me” if they accidentally bumped into somebody—but they didn’t specify any procedures for responding to sexual harassment, Mejia said.

In December, Mejia decided to report the behavior to her manager. But nothing was done, she said; the harasser once again appeared to escape repercussions. Instead, in January 2023, Mejia’s manager reduced her schedule from 40 hours a week to nearly half that, and then to just 13 hours by March—retaliation for reporting the harassment, Mejia said in her complaint.

Mejia decided to report the harassment again in August 2023, this time to an HR representative, but the situation only grew more unbearable in the months that followed, she said: Her harasser was emboldened and told Mejia that the lack of discipline meant she could do whatever she wanted. She started denying Mejia breaks, even to use the bathroom, and refusing to put in her lunch order so she could eat, Mejia said. Mejia was so disturbed that she would skip meals during her shifts and cry in her car instead.

“Nobody seemed interested in helping me with this situation,” Mejia said in Spanish through an interpreter. The harassment stopped only when the woman left the San Jose McDonald’s in May 2024.

McDonald’s did not respond to requests for comment on the specifics of Manuel’s or Mejia’s allegations. Manuel’s EEOC complaint was settled in March 2023. The California Civil Rights Department has not yet issued a ruling on Mejia’s complaint.

Mejia still works at the McDonald’s in San Jose; it’s difficult to find another job that allows her to pick her children up from school. But as a single mother of two who is now working fewer hours, she said, she has struggled financially, and has taken out loans to pay her rent, buy groceries, and pay her bills. “No puedo sobrevivir“—I can’t survive—she said.

Four years ago, McDonald’s promised to take action after allegations emerged of stunningly high rates of sexual harassment at its restaurants. A 2020 survey had found that three-quarters of female nonmanagerial employees had experienced sexual harassment. The company had faced not just a historic nationwide strike over the problem but dozens of lawsuits accusing it of failing to prevent and address harassment. That same year, The Nation published its own investigation based on a review of 24 legal complaints and conversations with restaurant workers who described rampant verbal and physical harassment, including being grabbed, groped, and threatened with rape. The CEO of McDonald’s at the time, Steve Easterbrook, was fired and then sued by the company later that year for engaging in multiple sexual relationships with subordinates against company policy.

In response to the bad press, McDonald’s announced in April 2021 that it would implement “global brand standards” to create “a culture of physical and psychological safety for employees and customers through the prevention of violence, harassment and discrimination.” The standards would apply, for the first time ever, to franchised as well as corporate-owned restaurants—a significant development given that, globally, 93 percent of McDonald’s locations are franchised. In the past, the company had declined to enforce corporate rules at its franchises and argued that it couldn’t be held liable for sexual harassment at such locations.

Under the new standards, the company said it would require restaurants to establish policies and provide trainings to combat sexual harassment, as well as reporting processes and annual employee and manager surveys. The standards were rolled out over the course of 2021 and took effect in January 2022. All McDonald’s locations were meant to be “assessed and held accountable” to the standards by that date.

Despite the company’s claims that the new standards would fix the problems, an investigation by The Nation and Type Investigations found that little changed in many McDonald’s locations after the standards went into effect. According to legal complaints from 20 workers in California, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas, not only has sexual harassment continued in these places, but when employees have reported it in the hopes that the company would address the situation, nothing was done. Instead, in several cases, workers like Manuel and Mejia said they were punished for coming forward by having their hours cut or even losing their jobs.

There is a likely reason why little has changed, experts say: The global brand standards have been inadequate to the task of preventing sexual harassment.

McDonald’s has not shared the details of the global brand standards publicly. Despite its efforts to keep them secret, however, The Nation and Type Investigations obtained an internal corporate document titled “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” that provides insights into what the standards consist of. This document details the criteria used by McDonald’s to evaluate whether its restaurants and franchises were in compliance with the brand standards after they were implemented, revealing how McDonald’s enforces its new solution. What this document suggests is that, while the requirements adhere to a certain logic for how to prevent and address sexual harassment, they are too broad and vague to be effective.

Eve Cervantez, a lawyer who is leading a class-action lawsuit against McDonald’s, said, “I have not seen that there has been any diminishment in complaints of sexual harassment at McDonald’s, and I have not seen any better response to allegations of sexual harassment since January 2022.” She added, “There’s no way the standards could have fixed the problem, because they’re not really addressing the problem.”

A McDonald’s spokesperson declined to provide details of the global brand standards to The Nation and Type Investigations. In response to a detailed list of questions about the global brand standards and sexual harassment in its restaurants after the standards went into effect, McDonald’s reiterated that it was committed to safeguarding workers and preventing abuse.

“Even one allegation of sexual harassment is too many. McDonald’s believes that every single individual who works under the arches deserves to experience a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace,” the company said in a statement. “To support our commitment to these values, we offer strong guidance aimed at preventing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. At our company-owned restaurants, this includes conducting trainings for all employees, providing resources and materials in the restaurants and offering multiple avenues for reporting concerns. We also provide Franchisees with optional tools and other resources aimed at making their employees feel valued, respected, and supported.”

McDonald’s has opposed the granting of class-action status for Cervantez’s case, Jamelia Fairley and Ashley Reddick v. McDonald’s, which has been ongoing since 2020 and includes complaints from dozens of restaurants in Florida. The company argues that the plaintiffs don’t have enough in common, haven’t provided sufficient evidence to establish a pattern of sexual harassment, and haven’t established that there is a general policy of discrimination; it also said that the restaurants in question had lawful anti-sexual-harassment policies and practices in place.

The allegations extend far beyond Florida, however. The Nation and Type Investigations reviewed three additional lawsuits, including one filed in Texas. In that case, a man named as E.S. alleges that his 15-year-old daughter was raped by a 28-year-old coworker while working at a McDonald’s in the small city of Hearne, less than two months after she was hired in February 2023. The coworker lured her to an area behind the restaurant, then battered and raped her by a dumpster, the suit alleges.

Ad Policy

“We never expected that something like that was going to happen,” the girl’s father told me.

The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault of a child and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. McDonald’s has denied that it bears any legal responsibility in the case, and the franchise denied “each and every” allegation made by the plaintiff. The lawsuit is set for trial in January 2026.

In the aftermath, the girl stayed home from school for about eight months, and as of December she still wasn’t speaking much to her family, her father said. “Before this happened, we used to live in a bubble where everybody in my family was safe. After this happened, it was like somebody popped that bubble.”

“I wish they can change all these McDonald’s,” he added, “so nobody can be hurt again.”

When McDonald’s announced its new global brand standards four years ago, it touted them as the key to eliminating sexual harassment from its restaurants. “There are no shortcuts to ensuring that people feel safe, respected and included at a McDonald’s restaurant. This work starts by taking big, intentional moves,” McDonald’s new CEO, Chris Kempczinski, said at the time.

From the beginning, however, details of what the new policies and procedures consist of have remained secret—even to McDonald’s restaurant employees. Rosalia Manuel told me that she never saw the standards, despite being a shift manager. And Eve Cervantez said she hasn’t encountered a single worker who was aware of the standards’ existence, let alone their content. When Cervantez requested that McDonald’s reveal the standards publicly as part of her lawsuit, McDonald’s argued that they must remain under seal, claiming that they are trade secrets that give the company a “competitive advantage.”

“If these are supposed to be these great standards that are going to help protect women in McDonald’s, why would they need to be under seal?” Cervantez said. A ruling on whether the details of the standards must be made public is still pending.

By choosing to keep the standards secret, McDonald’s could be limiting their effectiveness, said Vicki Magley, a psychology professor at the University of Connecticut who studies sexual harassment intervention. “There have to be consistent, distributed, accessible policies and procedures,” Magley continued. “If there is no policy that is clearly written and consistently distributed and that includes very clear procedures, then of course the employees are going to be confused.”

The problems with the standards may extend much further than secrecy, however. The “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document lists three primary criteria that restaurants and franchises had to adhere to in order to pass an inspection by a third-party assessor. The first of these: All restaurants and franchises must have a harassment, discrimination, and no-retaliation policy in place. The second: All employees have to complete anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training within 14 days of being hired. And the third: All restaurants must have a process for employees to report harassment as well as protocols for investigating any incidents.

These criteria are reasonable starting points for implementing anti-harassment efforts. The problem is that, even when taking into account a number of additional sub-criteria outlined in the document, they lack the teeth that many experts consider necessary to combat harassment.

While the company requires restaurants to have a policy in place on sexual harassment, for instance, it doesn’t require them to have a standard way of communicating the policy to employees; according to the document, the policy can be shared via e-mail or text message, outlined in lengthy employee handbooks, or simply reviewed during orientation. The document also does not specify that the policy be written in a language that workers can easily understand or in the language that they speak.

Such fuzziness can undermine any corporate standards from the get-go, experts said. In order to be effective, anti-harassment policies must clearly explain which behaviors are prohibited, describe how to report harassment, and state what workers can expect to happen when a report is made, all in plain language that workers can understand. They can’t simply be handed out once at the start of employment, but need to be reinforced and accessible after that—posted in the break room, for example, or sent on a regular basis. The goal is not only for victims of harassment to know what to do, but also for all employees to understand “what are the behavioral expectations in the workplace,” Magley said.

It is difficult to know precisely why McDonald’s harassment prevention efforts failed in each of the cases reviewed by The Nation and Type Investigations. However, what is clear is that, at all of the restaurants in question, the new global brand standards failed to protect workers as promised.

When Fernando Valencia was hired at a McDonald’s in Vallejo, California, at the end of 2021, he didn’t receive any training, including on sexual harassment, he told The Nation and Type Investigations. This was right before the brand standards went into effect. But even after, at the start of 2022, he was given neither information nor training. Although he heard that there was supposed to be some sort of information posted in the break room about what to do if sexual harassment happened, “No teníamos nada,” he said: They didn’t have anything.

This became a problem when, shortly after Valencia started, a male store manager began harassing him daily, according to a complaint he filed with the California Civil Rights Department, touching his genitalia or making him touch the manager’s genitalia, kissing him, and promising raises for participating. Valencia had recently immigrated from Mexico and didn’t know there were laws against what he experienced, he said. “No sabía cómo eso es, cómo denunciar a eso”: I didn’t know what that was, how to report that. But it weighed heavily on him, turning his workplace into a “nightmare,” he said in Spanish. “It makes you feel small and bad about yourself.”

In June 2022, he decided to tell the manager’s boyfriend what had been happening, and the next month his hours were reduced and he wasn’t given opportunities for overtime pay, he said. It was only then that he and other employees at that location were given sexual harassment training, he said, although new hires were not.

That training was spare, Valencia said. During an eight-hour computer training on how to do the job, he said, only 30 minutes were devoted to how to talk appropriately to coworkers. The digital module warned employees not to touch each other because it could be considered sexual harassment, but it didn’t go into more detail than that. The store’s owners investigated his allegation after he filed his legal complaint, but nothing else was done about the harassment, he said.

The California Civil Rights Department declined to pursue Valencia’s case on his behalf but acknowledged his right to sue. A McDonald’s spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about Valencia’s case.

At least six other workers whose complaints The Nation and Type Investigations reviewed reported receiving no training at all after January 2022. This should not have happened, according to the “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document. The document is clear that, in order for a restaurant to pass a brand standards inspection, assessors must ensure that it has a training program in place. The document fails to specify, however, what those trainings must consist of; nor does it require any kind of assessment as to whether they are effective or have any impact on the problem of sexual harassment.

The consequences of this lack of muscular requirements became evident in the cases of several workers who did receive training but say it was cursory and digital-only. Two workers in the Florida towns of Apopka and Lakeland who are participants in the Fairley class-action lawsuit said that the anti-harassment training they received after January 2022 consisted of slides in a PowerPoint presentation. Others watched short videos.

“The training in general felt rushed, like they just wanted me to learn how to physically do the job so that I could start working,” Salma Linda Chappa, who was hired at a McDonald’s in Plant City, Florida, in June 2022, stated in a legal filing in Fairley. It was during her orientation that a male manager started hitting on her within earshot of two other managers, who didn’t do anything to stop it, she stated. The harassment prompted her to quit a week later.

Zoe Newsome was already on edge about sexual harassment at McDonald’s before she was hired; female friends had told her they had been sexually harassed working there, she told me. But she needed the money to help her mother with bills, so in September 2021, at age 16, she began working as a crew member at a McDonald’s in Kissimmee, Florida, her first job. During her orientation, she watched a short slideshow that included basic information about sexual harassment. It “only lasted a few minutes and was not very helpful,” she wrote in a legal filing in the Fairley lawsuit.

About a year later, Newsome was promoted to crew trainer and was made to do the same sort of training, watching a “very short” video on harassment and how to report it. Neither training mentioned sexual harassment by customers, she alleges, or what to do if it happened.

Newsome told me that she’s the kind of person who “freezes up when that happens to me,” but if she had been taught what to do in the face of harassment, she might have been more prepared to handle it. “You’re young, it’s your first job, you don’t know what to do,” she said. “It’s kind of like ‘Fend for yourself.’”

McDonald’s did not comment on Newsome’s claims or those of any other worker.

While mandatory sexual harassment training via computer tutorials or videos has become common, experts say these trainings generally don’t stick with employees. “A training video coupled with a policy that’s handed to you is just wholly insufficient to change behavior,” said Gillian Thomas, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, who has represented sexual harassment plaintiffs against McDonald’s.

Instead, experts say, in order to be effective, anti-harassment training should be interactive, delivered by a human instead of a computer, tailored to the audience, and last at least four hours. The training should also be done regularly after people are hired, experts say. And companies should follow up with employees to see whether the training has had an impact.

Effective training is done “in a way that will actually inspire interest, inspire commitment to some kind of behavioral change,” Magley said.

Training is only the first step in addressing sexual harassment. It’s equally important for employees to have channels to report incidents—and for employers to have a clear process for investigating such reports, experts say.

The “2022 U.S. People Brand Standards Visit” document specifies that restaurants have to make the details of their reporting processes “visible and easily accessible in the restaurant.” This could mean a poster with a hotline number to call with any concerns or a document outlining how to make a report. It also says that restaurants must have a protocol in place for responding to employees who report concerns, but as with the training requirements, it doesn’t specify what those protocols should be. All of the workers who reported harassment after January 2022 said nothing was done.

Ashanti Torres-Rodriguez, who was 16 when she started working at a McDonald’s in Bradenton, Florida, didn’t know what to do when a male coworker in his 40s or 50s began asking her out and making comments about her body; she had never been informed, she told me. After he touched her back one day, she decided to tell her manager, according to a legal filing in Fairley, and when he kept touching her, she reported it to two other managers and eventually to the general manager.

The general manager, who seemed to be friendly with her harasser, didn’t appear to believe her, according to her legal filing. Torres-Rodriguez doesn’t think anyone investigated, and she kept being scheduled to work with the man, who touched her for months, despite her attempts to change shifts. The experience led to frequent panic attacks—so many that her general manager threatened to fire her because they were causing her to have to leave work so often. She quit in June 2022 to get away from the abuse, taking a lower-paying job at Dollar Tree; as of a year ago, she said, her harasser still worked at McDonald’s.

Torres-Rodriguez’s experience is not uncommon. Six other workers involved in Fairley said they were told to report incidents to their managers or the general manager—but they weren’t told what to do if that person failed to act.

On her first day at a McDonald’s in Bradenton in January 2022, Marybeth Wiggins told her manager that the person training her had harassed her, but the manager responded that it was “not a big deal,” according to her legal filing. On her third day, after the person touched her butt, she reported it to a different shift manager, who suggested she wait and, if it happened again, fill out paperwork about it. After another male trainer tried to grab her breasts, she asked a manager to file an official complaint, but once again was met with indifference. “It seemed like managers just wanted the job to get done, no matter what was happening to their employees—they didn’t care if anyone was being harassed,” Wiggins wrote in a complaint in Fairley.

McDonald’s managers also appear to have been ill-equipped to deal with sexual harassment by customers. Customers sexually harassed Zoe Newsome “every few weeks,” she alleges in her legal complaint. One grabbed her wrist whenever she handed food to him. Another told her, “You look like you’re good in bed.” One man in his 50s told her, “You look like an angel, but you’re actually a bad girl,” leaving her with chills and feeling like she was going to throw up.

Early on, Newsome told her manager, who “laughed uncomfortably” and did nothing else. She kept reporting it to various managers, but they never investigated the incidents and never filed any official reports. Nothing was done. Instead, they laughed it off. “They seemed desensitized to it,” she wrote.

“I’m a workaholic, I love to work, but I didn’t feel safe,” Newsome told me. “It honestly made me hate going to work.” She quit in November 2022. “I think McDonald’s is probably the worst when it comes to sexual harassment.”

Making sure employees feel safe reporting sexual harassment is essential to combating it, experts say. Employees should be allowed to report harassment to anyone, not just specific managers. Those managers have to then be trained in how to properly deal with reports—particularly in the fast food industry, where young people are often promoted into leadership—and there have to be visible consequences for any reports found to have merit.

Another important duty of any manager is making sure those who report harassment are protected from retaliation. But four workers say that they faced consequences for speaking up.

Valencia Pratt, who worked at a McDonald’s in Miami Gardens, Florida, in early 2022, while she was pregnant, alleges in a legal filing in Fairley that a male coworker made inappropriate comments to her like “Your booty is big” and “I want to eat your front” every day. Pratt asked to be put on different shifts so she wouldn’t have to work with him; she was fired less than a week later.

Reducing sexual harassment is not simple, but it is also not mysterious. What it requires of employers is a concerted commitment and a determination not simply to check off items on a list but to fundamentally change workplace culture. That’s because workers’ behavior “is guided by organizational norms, by what is and is not appropriate,” said Gillian Thomas, the ACLU attorney. “The only way to move the needle on culture change is through repetition and consistency of message, and having the message come from a variety of places, including from the very top—and then building in consequences when you don’t measure up.”

Experts have provided McDonald’s with a playbook for addressing sexual harassment more effectively. In a class-action sexual harassment lawsuit filed against McDonald’s in Michigan that was settled in April 2022, the plaintiffs sought an injunction to require the company to work with employees to develop mandatory training focused on recognizing, preventing, and addressing sexual harassment in the types of scenarios actually faced by McDonald’s workers.

Their proposal would have required McDonald’s to go farther than the measures the company currently appears to have in place. McDonald’s would have had to revise its anti-harassment policies so they were in plain language; implement a well-publicized process with multiple channels for reporting harassment; develop a protocol for investigating complaints by someone “skilled in conducting and documenting workplace investigations”; and ensure that people who engage in harassment and managers who fail to intervene face consequences.

The proposal would also have required practices to prevent retaliation and a system to monitor complaints and their resolutions, plus metrics to ensure that franchises prevent harassment and are penalized if they don’t. The settlement in the case meant that McDonald’s did not have to make these changes.

Instead, for many McDonald’s workers, the current global brand standards have not done enough to keep them safe. The consequences for some have been devastating.

Rosalia Manuel hasn’t worked since she was fired from the McDonald’s in Saratoga, California, in 2022. She’s had to seek out therapy, and her depression has been hard on her four children. Her family has had to rely on her husband’s income as a cook at Google and the money the couple makes cleaning carpets on the weekends. But that still isn’t enough to cover their rent, car payments, and food.

As difficult as the situation is, however, Manuel says that it’s the lack of accountability for those who did nothing to stop the harassment that she finds most frustrating.

“Saber que las personas malas estan trabajando allí me duele más,” Manuel said through sobs: Knowing bad people are working there hurts me more.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Covert-McDonalds-ftr.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:24:20.063135

""One of my members called this 'tariff hell,'"" said Bob Kirke, executive director of the Canadian Apparel Federation.

Retail groups in the U.S. have similarly warned that tariffs on Asian countries, where most American clothing is manufactured, will mean a steep uptick in prices ahead of the back-to-school season.

While the Canadian apparel sector wasn't targeted directly by the tariffs, many companies headquartered here make their products overseas and sell to customers south of the border.

Canadian retail giants like Aritzia, Lululemon and Gildan saw their stock tumble after the tariffs were announced last week by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Access to the U.S. market is critical for brands in this country if they hope to grow past a certain point, says Emma May, founder of the Calgary-based womenswear brand Sophie Grace.

""The U.S. market's amazing, it's huge,"" said May, who has customers on both sides of the border. ""We solve the same problem for the U.S. customer that we solve for a Canadian customer and there are 10 [times as many] of them.""

But May is starting to reconsider some of her U.S. expansion plans.

Her clothes are made in China and warehoused in Canada, where they are shipped to U.S. e-commerce customers. On top of an additional 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods imposed last week, the White House has also said a previous exemption, that allowed small orders from China into the U.S. without tariffs, is closing.

""Maybe the U.S. market is just not something we can go at because our products will end up being just far too expensive for that customer,"" said May.

It's unlikely the U.S. will allow loopholes for Chinese-made products that make a pit stop in Canada before being sold in the U.S., says trade lawyer John Boscariol.

The Trump administration ""is trying to close up any loophole or potential exemption,"" said Boscariol, a partner with McCarthy Tetrault in Toronto.

And while clothing is a prime example, Boscariol says many Canadian businesses are likely dealing with the same problem.

""Whether you're in clothing, apparel items, toys, whatever... whether that's China, Vietnam or any other country in Asia that's now been targeted with very significant tariffs, you're going to be impacted by this in terms of your access to the U.S. market.""

Why not change factories?

Jeremy Oldland, co-owner of the Montreal kids clothing company Hatley, manufactures his products in China and India. He supplies pint-sized rain boots, pajamas and jackets to department stores, boutiques and e-commerce customers south of the border.

U.S. sales make up about half his revenue, says Oldland, and he expects that imposing a new surcharge on all those orders will spur a wave of cancellations.

""We're going to sell less product. It's going to hurt any way you do it,"" he said. And yet shifting supply chains out of Asia to North America would be difficult.

""We don't have the tradesmanship, the craftsmanship, we don't have the printing techniques, we don't have a lot of things [in Canada].""

Kirke, with the apparel federation, says the new tariffs are hitting the industry particularly hard because they seem to come out of left field.

In recent years, growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China have prompted some larger retailers to start shifting production outside of that country, a move that was also driven in part by reports of forced labour in China's Xinjiang region.

But now, the U.S. is also going after smaller manufacturing hubs like Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where companies had previously been trying to diversify their production.

""That's a hard, hard thing to deal with,"" said Kirke.

Kirke says he is glad that the U.S. tariffs don't hit Canadian-made products, though this is a relatively small portion of the total industry.

The hope, he says, is that Trump will change course and back down on his tariff policy.

As for May, with the brand Sophie Grace, she hopes to continue growing her business — but with an emphasis on customers north of the border.

""We will obviously be looking to retrench in the Canadian market and then also explore other markets like Australia and Europe,"" she said.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7504382.1744071082!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/sophie-grace.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-04-08 12:22:36.342220

The business cited multiple challenges, including rising commodity prices, calls for consumer boycott and cost of living pressures further weighing on spending.

Starbucks said footfall at some locations was affected the first half of the year due to what it described as misconceptions around its stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. The firm was listed among companies targeted for boycott over alleged support for Israel.

In line with its weaker financial performance, Starbucks UK paid £1million in corporation tax, down significantly from £7.2million the year before.

The decision comes after 15 years of consistent investment in the plant, which has struggled to meet production expectations in recent years.
Richard Trechman, managing director of Danone DACH, acknowledged the difficulty of this decision, highlighting the commitment of the Ochsenfurt employees and the plant's long-standing legacy.
""Nevertheless, the plant in Ochsenfurt is not sustainable in the current market situation.
The decision to close the Ochsenfurt plant is attributed to a dramatic decline in capacity utilisation, which is expected to reach only 50% of 2019 levels this year.","Danone is set to close its dairy production facility in Ochsenfurt by the fourth quarter of 2026, a move driven by shifts in consumer behaviour, low capacity utilisation and rising operational costs. The decision comes after 15 years of consistent investment in the plant, which has struggled to meet production expectations in recent years.

The closure will impact approximately 230 employees, and Danone has committed to providing fair social plans, retraining programmes and continued employment opportunities within the company for those affected.

Richard Trechman, managing director of Danone DACH, acknowledged the difficulty of this decision, highlighting the commitment of the Ochsenfurt employees and the plant's long-standing legacy.

“We have grown in an extremely challenging environment in the German-speaking region in recent years and are strongly positioned for the future. I am very proud of what we have achieved as a team,” he said. ""Nevertheless, the plant in Ochsenfurt is not sustainable in the current market situation.

Hecontinued: ""There is less consumer demand for the locally manufactured products and high-potential Danone products cannot be produced locally. I very much wish we didn't have to make these plans for Ochsenfurt. In this context, I can only assure all employees that we will do everything we can to find another position at Danone for as many employees as possible.”

Despite the closure, Danone is reaffirming its commitment to the German market, with plans to concentrate production efforts at its Fulda site, which specialises in baby formula and medical nutrition.

The Fulda facility is one of Danone's largest in the region, employing nearly 600 staff members. The company intends to invest significantly in this site as part of its ‘Renew Danone’ initiative, aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and product specialisation.

The decision to close the Ochsenfurt plant is attributed to a dramatic decline in capacity utilisation, which is expected to reach only 50% of 2019 levels this year. Danone's management has cited changing consumer preferences and higher production costs compared to other European facilities as key factors in this strategic shift.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8f1abd_1435772c579146629579a1e230881f1f~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_5125,h_3417,al_c,q_90/8f1abd_1435772c579146629579a1e230881f1f~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-04-08 07:01:46.540077

Levi Strauss posted first-quarter profit that beat estimates on Monday, as higher full-price selling of its bottom wears and cost-saving efforts boosted the denim maker's margins.

Shares of the company, down about 22 per cent this year, rose about 2 per cent in extended trading as Levi maintained its full-year forecasts for sales and profit, which did not account for any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

The retailer has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up - a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie and Fitch and Gap - despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

Advt

The company's finance chief, Harmit Singh, has in the past noted that a diverse supply chain with sourcing from over 25 countries gave Levi an edge over other retailers at a time when tariff risks have hit footwear and apparel retailers from Nike to Target.

""The company's celebrity partnerships, marketing efforts, and strong product pipeline are helping it to win over shoppers despite growing uncertainty - which bodes well for its ability to navigate an increasingly challenging macro-environment,"" said eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1 per cent for the three months ended March 2, from 58.8 per cent last year, driven by lower product costs and a strong direct-to-consumer channel.

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

""Dockers is a business that we're currently in a competitive process to sell sometime in 2025,"" CFO Singh told Reuters.

The company's quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 38 cents per share, compared to estimates of 28 cents.

It posted a 3 per cent rise in revenue from continuing operations to $1.53 billion, which excluded sales from its Dockers brand, now reclassified as a discontinued operation.

Analysts, on average, were expecting a 1 per cent drop in revenue to $1.54 billion, as per data compiled by LSEG, including Dockers.

Instacart's business customers have access to a new white-label service designed to meet the needs of urgent, ""fill-in"" orders.

The grocery technology company’s Instacart Business subsidiary is launching Will Call Delivery, a new offering tailored for distributors and business operators in need of rapid fulfillment.

[READ MORE: Instacart launches business-to-business marketplace]

Will Call Delivery is a white-label solution built for distributors to streamline same-day ordering via their sales reps. Business-to-business and wholesale customers that need items fast can order from their sales reps as usual, and the sales reps can then request an Instacart shopper pick up specific, high-priority items from their warehouse and deliver to their end customers, all in a couple of clicks.

In addition, in an effort to better address out-of-stocks or service customers that are far from the warehouse, distributors have the ability to place orders from retailers on the Instacart marketplace that are closer to their end customers.

This personalized, targeted fulfillment option is designed for circumstances such as when a restaurant owner needs a case of limes or chicken breasts hours before the dinner rush.

All Instacart shoppers have access to comprehensive shopper educational modules covering a variety of food safety topics, including personal hygiene, cross-contamination, time/temperature control for safety (TCS) foods, and storage and transportation tips.

According to Instacart, it will be expanding Will Call Delivery and partnering with additional distributors in 2025 to bring the service, currently in pilot with select companies, to a wider group of businesses.

A global luxury brand is AI-enabling its leather goods production and procurement planning capabilities.

Based in Milan, Italy, Prada Group operates brands including Prada, Miu Miu, Church’s, Car Shoe and Marchesi 1824. The company is implementing the artificial intelligence-based o9 Digital Brain platform in an initiative to approve leather goods production orders more efficiently.

Prada Group will tailor reports to support near real-time procurement decisions and leverage root-cause analysis reporting across its highly complex, multi-tier global supply chain to provide insights across ongoing and upcoming production flows.

As a result, the company seeks to help planners anticipate and proactively mitigate potential leather goods supply chain issues, develop finished goods and semi-finished goods production plans, provide greater visibility into capacity at internal factories and external suppliers, and align raw material procurement with production plans.

“o9 is pleased to partner with Prada Group on its journey to optimize production planning with a world-class platform that mitigates potential risks that could create capacity bottlenecks, and to develop processes that enable smarter procurement, planning, and decision-making,” said Chakri Gottemukkala, o9 co-founder and CEO. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Prada Group in the years to come.”

Prada Group also uses cloud-based solutions from Oracle Retail and Adobe to help collect and analyze customer data to enhance personalization and targeted promotions.

Cincinnati-based supermarket giant Kroger reported this month that its aborted takeover of Albertsons cost the company more than $1 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The nation’s largest traditional supermarket operator disclosed it spent $684 million in 2024 on “merger related costs” mostly on “third-party professional fees (outside experts, such as lawyers) and credit facility fees (borrowing costs),” according to its annual report filed on April 1. The latest bills were on top of $316 million spent in 2023 and $44 million spent in 2022. The grocer first announced the proposed deal in October 2022.

Lawyers and other consultants were busy in 2024

Last year was the busiest of Kroger’s merger gambit: antitrust regulators including the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from Washington state and Colorado filed separate lawsuits to kill the $25 billion proposed transaction; from August to October, the merits of and objections to the deal were argued in courtrooms in both Seattle and Portland, Oregon; and in December, two separate judges, one federal and one from Washington state, issued rulings blocking the deal, which prompted Albertsons to call the deal off a day later.

Critics of the proposed $25 billion merger said the deal would give Kroger too much power in the marketplace. They also argued it could worsen rampant inflation that drove overall supermarket prices 25% higher after the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.

Lawsuits could add to the final merger tab

In the collapsed deal’s aftermath, there may be further costs: Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons sued Kroger the same day it pulled out of the deal, blaming the grocer for botching regulatory approval. And last month, Kroger’s former proposed divestiture partner, C&S Wholesale Foods, which stood to acquire nearly 600 stores if the merger went through, filed a lawsuit in Delaware, claiming Kroger owed the New Hampshire-based company a termination fee for the canceled deal.

Both retailers have announced the departures of their respective CEOs; and both grocers have cut jobs. In March, Kroger announced Rodney McMullen, CEO since 2014, had resigned amid an investigation into his “personal conduct” that “was inconsistent” with the grocer’s policy of business ethics.

Kroger has launched a search for a new CEO and is currently being led by Ron Sargent, 69, a board member and former Staples CEO.

Based in downtown Cincinnati, Kroger employs 409,000 workers nationwide, including roughly 20,000 in Greater Cincinnati. Kroger operates 76 stores in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, employing 14,500 associates.","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/04/PCIN/75070320007-kroger-albertsons-mashup.png?crop=4070,2290,x0,y212&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-08 01:59:44.276241

A higher tariff rate will start on Apr.
Trump fired back on Monday, threatening an additional 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't remove its US tariffs.","Levi's (LEVI) execs just gave a market nervous over bruising tariffs a taste of what's to come for earnings season.

A heavy dose of confusion, with a lack of clear cut guidance for investors in search of badly needed clarity.

""Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible,” Levi's long-time CFO Harmit Singh said on a late Monday earnings call.

“For now, our full-year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.""

Levi's CEO Michelle Gass said the company has assembled an internal ""task force"" to determine the tariff impact and proper responses, such as price increases.

The company relies on 130 facilities in China and 50 in Vietnam — two countries Trump earmarked for large tariffs — to produces its various apparel offerings.

At least for now, the market thinks Levi's may be able to overcome some tariff headwinds.

Shares rallied more than 10% in pre-market trading on Tuesday on the unchanged profit outlook and a 10 cent quarterly earnings beat. Execs said on the call that demand remained solid through the end of March.

Levi's shares were among the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform.

But whether the post earnings rally can be sustained is up in the air.

President Trump uncorked a baseline tariff rate of 10% that went into effect on Apr. 5.

A higher tariff rate will start on Apr. 9 for about 60 countries that the administration considers to be the worst trade offenders.

Some of those nations are important sourcing and business regions for large US retailers in Levi's and Nike (NKE). China, for example, will see reciprocal tariffs of 34%. Vietnam clocks in at 46%.

The reciprocal tariffs are on top of existing duties, such as the 20% Trump imposed on China earlier, bringing the total rate on the country to 54%.

China has retaliated with a 34% tariff on American goods. Trump fired back on Monday, threatening an additional 50% tariff on China if the country doesn't remove its US tariffs.

""Levi’s isn’t immune to cost shocks or consumer slowdown: for sensitivity, we estimate tariffs could represent a high-single digit percentage hit to calendar 2026 earnings power assuming no degradation in consumer demand; and could represent mid-teens percentage hit to calendar 2026 earnings power assuming a mid-single digit percentage impact to quantity demanded,"" Stifel apparel stock analyst Jim Duffy said in a note on Tuesday.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UVAlC0uQcajskoeN1WhdFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/520fd020-1407-11f0-aa9f-77c4b84a8f8c,N,,2025-04-08 05:03:35.375572

(Reuters) -Levi Strauss maintained on Monday its annual forecast for sales and profit, excluding the impact of tariffs, and posted quarterly profit ahead of Wall Street targets, sending its shares up more than 7% in after hours trade.

Sweeping tariffs by President Donald Trump have sparked concerns over a global downturn and sharp price hikes for items such as clothing and footwear.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" President and Chief Executive Michelle Gass said in a statement on Monday.

The company said in January that a diverse supply chain across 25 countries would allow it cross-source products.

Levi imports only about 1% of its merchandise directly from China into the U.S., while that for Mexico was about 5%, its executives said in January.

The retailer is looking at price increases as one of the mitigating measures, said Gass, adding that price increases will be ""surgical.""

It has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up - a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap - despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

In its quarterly filing with regulators, the company added that it was analyzing the impact of tariffs and what it could do to minimize impact.

""We expect these new tariffs to have a material impact on our results of operations in fiscal year 2025,"" it added.

It also said the environment could affect production and distribution.

""If these disruptions persist, they may require us to modify our current sourcing practices, which may impact our product costs, and, if not mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations,"" it warned.

""Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the (tariff) impacts are uncertain,"" CFO Harmit Singh said on a post-earnings call.

Rachel Wolff, an analyst at eMarketer, said, ""Levi Strauss (NYSE: )’ unchanged forecast shows the sheer impossibility of planning ahead, as uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff moves paralyzes brands.""

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

The company expects fiscal 2025 net revenue to be down in the range of 1% and 2% and adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 per share.

On an adjusted basis, it earned a profit of 38 cents per share in the quarter, compared to estimates of 28 cents.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 22:01:55.589040

In response, the US-listed company said: “We have no political agenda. We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere — and never have.”

It also wrestled with new entrants into the UK’s “highly competitive” coffee market as well as cost of living pressures squeezing disposable income. A weaker consumer environment coincided with inflationary pressures for commodities such as dairy and cocoa and wage inflation.

Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macroeconomic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology

across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme and further

optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.”

The business, which opened 100 new stores last year, has 1,240 coffee shops in the UK, which comprise 378 company-owned stores and 862 run by licensees. The company has outlined plans to open a further 80 shops this year.

This compares to earnings of $0.26 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 35.71%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this jeans maker would post earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of 4.17%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Levi Strauss , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $1.53 billion for the quarter ended February 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.95%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.56 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Levi Strauss shares have lost about 19.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -13.7%.

What's Next for Levi Strauss?

While Levi Strauss has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Levi Strauss: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.16 on $1.42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.27 on $6.27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the bottom 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Floor & Dcor (FND), another stock in the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025.

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Floor & Dcor's revenues are expected to be $1.16 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Levi excluded its Dockers brand, that it’s looking to sell, from its results and adjusted its outlook to reflect an expected divestment.","[NEW YORK] Levi Strauss maintained a full-year outlook that excludes the impact from sweeping new US tariffs that are poised to significantly raise costs for multinational apparel companies.

The San Francisco-based company said its guidance for fiscal 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply-chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors. Levi sees organic revenue growth, which excludes items such as currency impact and divestments, growing 3.5 to 4.5 per cent this year.

Shares rose 2.1 per cent at 4.55 pm in extended New York trading. Since US President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on Apr 2, the stock has declined 19 per cent.

Chief financial officer Harmit Singh said it’s “difficult to forecast or plan at this stage” for the tariffs’ impact on consumers. He said the company is focused on issues it can control such as its relationships with vendors and the cost base for its products.

Chief executive officer Michelle Gass said the company is approaching the topic of tariffs with “urgency, but not being overly reactive”.

Levi is one of the first retailers to report earnings after Trump unveiled the tariffs last week.

The company says it sources about 5 per cent of its goods in the US from Mexico, a mid-single digit from Vietnam and 1 per cent from China. It works with 130 facilities in China, 50 in Vietnam, 37 in Bangladesh and 36 in Sri Lanka, according to a company website listing partners in its supply chain.

Gass said Levi sources from 28 countries, adding they are “the places that you’d expect in the apparel industry”.

“We are doing our homework,” she added, without offering more details on specific measures the company is taking to counteract the tariffs. If the company needs to raise prices, it would be “surgical”, Gass said, and be focused on new products that have resonated with shoppers.

In its release, the company said it has “secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders” in the second quarter.

In the first quarter, the company posted earnings of 38 US cents a share, higher than the average analyst estimate. Levi excluded its Dockers brand, that it’s looking to sell, from its results and adjusted its outlook to reflect an expected divestment.

The company is focused on bolstering its namesake brand and increasing sales through its own channels, such as its stores and website.

Please note that Michelle and Hermit will be referencing organic net revenues or constant currency numbers unless otherwise noted, and information provided is based on continuing operations, which excludes $76,000,000 of net revenues related to Docker. Today’s call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed.

And now I’d like to turn over the call to Michelle. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to today’s call. I’m pleased to share that 2025 is off to a strong start, and our shift to becoming a DTC first company is driving both strategic and financial value. In q one, we exceeded expectations across sales, margins, and EPS, driven by the momentum of our strategy. We again achieved high single digit organic net revenue growth, up 9%.

Direct to consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings, and strong e com performance. Our wholesale business delivered another quarter of positive growth, up 5%. Our US business further accelerated, up 8%, while international was strong as well, up nine percent. And we extended our market leadership with share gains across both women’s and men’s. I am proud we are able to deliver these strong results while fundamentally changing the way we work as part of our hard pivot towards becoming a best in class omnichannel retailer.

Given last week’s tariff announcements, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment. However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times. As an iconic brand with more than a hundred and seventy years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality, and that’s what Levi’s has always stood for.

Today, almost 60% of our revenue is generated outside The US. We have scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty. I’ll now walk you through highlights from the quarter in the context of our strategy. Note that all numbers that Harmit and I will reference are on an organic basis and exclude jockers, which as you saw in our release, has been moved to discontinued operations as we explore a sale of the brand. Let’s start with our first strategy, being brand led.

The Levi’s brand was up 8% for the quarter and continued to reach new levels of strength all over the world. While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. You can see that through our partnership with the most influential artist of our generation, Beyonce. Since launching Reimagine in September of twenty twenty four, the campaign has generated more than 4,300,000,000 impressions and more than $65,000,000 in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our market. As another proof point in our ongoing efforts to drive brand heat, this last quarter, the Levi’s brand was featured in a complete unknown, a highly celebrated biopic of Bob Dylan starring Timothee Chalamet.

Bob Dylan, known for his love of Levi’s, has shaped and defined culture across many decades. To commemorate the film’s release, we launched a limited edition collection featuring some of Bob Dylan’s wardrobe staples. This example of how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future is further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage. We are also partnering with authentic, locally influential icons to drive brand heat and anchor the brand at the center of culture across the globe. Earlier this month, we expanded our partnership in India with Punjabi superstar Diljit Dosan and launched a new campaign in Germany with Stephanie Geisinger, strengthening our appeal with consumers in both of these important markets.

And as a testament to the strength of the Levi’s brand, we gained market share in men’s and women’s in the quarter, further solidifying our number one position in denim across both categories. And consistent with our strategy to recruit younger fans to the brand, we also grew share with our 18 30 year old target consumer demographic. These consumers transacted a higher AUR and purchased more frequently than our average consumer. Moving to product. While our history is built on jeans, our future will be built around lifestyle, always rooted in denim.

For most of our history, we’ve been known as a men’s jeans business. But to achieve our bold aspirations, we need to be more. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly expanded our head to toe offering, especially with women, while maintaining our dominance with men. This enables us to further expand our already large total addressable market. And as a result, women’s continued to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues.

Tops represents more than 20% of our business, which has more than doubled over the last ten years. Inspired by denim lifestyle, newer categories such as dresses, skirts, and outerwear continue to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the business. And while we’re the leader in jeans, our portfolio beyond denim bottoms now comprises 35% of our total sales. As we diversify our product portfolio, we also remain laser focused on our core Levi’s bottoms business. And in q one, bottoms were up 9%, driven by strength in both men’s and women’s.

The continued success we’ve achieved in bottoms is attributable to our fit diversification strategy. We have a style for everyone for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15% of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Finch Faggy available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volume surpassing 200,000,000.

And with men, we’ve been focused on expanding this trend through new fit launches, like the five sixty eight loose straight and the five seventy eight baggy. While there’s so much buzz around the loose and baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20% of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses. We continue to infuse innovation and newness into these styles with a robust pipeline of new fits, finishes, and fabrics. Our men’s classic five eleven slim fit is a great example now offered across the range of fabric, washes, colors, as well as part of our new tech series, earning us more space in his closet. As part of our denim lifestyle strategy, tops remain a key growth category for us.

And in the quarter, tops grew 7%. We’re seeing stronger growth in our direct to consumer channel, up low double digits, where we offer our broadest assortment. There is a long runway for growth in our tops business, and the strong demand we’re seeing in our DTC channel give us great confidence that this will scale to be a meaningful part of our business over time. Our pipeline of newness and innovation remains robust, and I’m confident this will continue to drive impact and resonate with our fans. We continue to see an opportunity to further premiumize the brand with the global launch of the Levi’s Blue Tab collection.

Introduced in Asia earlier this year, Blu Tab paired our iconic Levi’s aesthetic with the quality and sensibility of Japanese craftsmanship. Our most elevated expression of denim leadership to date, the collection features iconic denim staples along with new tops, skirts, and outerwear. And building on the success of our lightweight denim collection, we’re excited to introduce our newest innovation, linen and denim, combining the authentic feel of blue jeans with soft, light linen. Now shifting to our strategy to be DTC first. Our global direct to consumer business delivered another quarter of double digit growth, up 12% and posting its twelfth consecutive quarter of positive comp.

AURs in the channel were up mid single digits as customers are gravitating to more premium products as well as an intentional reduction in promotion in our stores. DTC productivity actions, including improving the front of house consumer experience and back of house efficiency, are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel. I see firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team. Our stores today reflect a more robust head to toe offering compared to when we were mainly a men’s denim bottoms destination, and we’re now showcasing a broader denim lifestyle assortment through tops, dresses, outerwear skirts, and both denim and nondenim bottoms. Our inventory levels are healthier with better in stock availability, and we’re equipping our stylists with enhanced product knowledge and improved selling techniques.

The results of all of this work are more productive and profitable doors, increasing our conviction that we can build several hundred more stores in the future. And we are on that path today. In q one, we continued executing our retail expansion plan. Notable openings include Rome on Via Cola Di Renzo, 1 of the most renowned shopping streets in Italy, and continued expansion across Mexico and India as we grow our retail footprint in these important markets. We have abundant opportunity to increase our DTC presence in major markets all around the world, including here in The US.

Our efforts to accelerate our performance in our ecommerce business are working with a channel up 16% in q one on top of 13% in the prior year. Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our econ channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment, and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience. We have upgraded the content on our site with higher quality imagery that focuses on our lifestyle assortment and enhanced storytelling. We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our product in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for The US E Com business rising to its highest level ever.

Today, comprising just 12% of our total company net revenues, we believe that e commerce represents another significant engine for growth. DTC ended the quarter at 52% of total global net revenues, up two points to last year, accounting for over half of our total revenue, a milestone as we transform into a DTC first company. We are also encouraged by the performance in our global wholesale channel, up 5%, driven by strong growth in The US. US wholesale exceeded our expectations in the quarter, up 9%, in part driven by door expansion and more space with our broadened lifestyle assortment. Our Levi’s women’s business was a particular bright spot, up 17%.

Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, US department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was ten years ago. Signature, our value brand, also grew this quarter, up 19%, driven by strength in our seasonal fit. And as we look to the balance of the year, we remain prudent as respect global wholesale. We continue to expect the channel to be flat for the full year on an organic basis, and this continues to be an important profitable channel for us. Now turning to our third strategy, powering the portfolio.

Our international business represents close to 60% of our total business today, up 9% in q one, driven by growth in Mexico, The UK, France, and Germany. International growth remains an important opportunity for us long term, and we continue to believe that we are underpenetrated. Beyond yoga was up 10% in q one.

Unidentified Speaker: We

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: are continuing to focus on brand building initiatives to drive awareness and profitable growth. Customers are responding to our broad assortment of colorways and styles, as well as new products like our luxe fleece collection, expanded outerwear assortment, and our lifestyle status trousers. And comp sales in our small but growing network of stores were positive for the quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We recognize that the environment around us continues to have uncertainty, and we’re focused on the things we can control.

Our first quarter performance demonstrates how our transformation into a best in class lifestyle retailer is accelerating both the top line and the bottom line. Our key strategies of being brand led, DTC first, and powering our portfolio, along with our efforts to rewire our company to be faster and more consumer obsessed, are working and are gaining momentum. Our team is focused on executing with excellence, and I’m grateful to our employees around the globe for their commitment to the change underway and for their unwavering dedication to consistently deliver for our fans. I am confident we have the right foundation to capture the opportunity ahead and deliver profitable long term growth for all of our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Harmit to provide a financial overview of the quarter and our expectations for the year.

Harmit?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Michel. We started the year with momentum. Our financial results were better than expected, and our transformation to a DDC first lifestyle business is making real progress. As you saw in this morning’s press release, Dockers has been reclassified to discontinued operations. As you will notice, while Dockers was a positive contributor to sales, our gross and operating margin structure is higher, excluding Dockers, thereby improving the structural economic and profitability of our remaining business.

Our focus on structural economics is reflected in the fact that net revenues, margins, expenses, and EPS were all better than expected. While global wholesale net revenues were up for the second consecutive quarter, our direct to consumer business continues to lead our growth, with net revenues up 12% as we consistently execute the three things that matter most in this channel, what I call a trifecta, positive comp sales, opening high performing stores, and growing ecommerce profitability. Besides the double digit top line growth, our direct to consumer EBIT margins grew 500 basis points in the quarter, contributing to the company’s overall margin expansion. This is helping drive sustainable sequential progression across our p and l. Q one twenty five organic net revenues accelerated to 9% versus flat in q one twenty three and ’24.

Gross margin was a record at 62.1 this quarter versus 58.2 in q one twenty four and fifty six point five in q one twenty three. Given our expense discipline in q one, we were also able to leverage adjusted SG and A margin by 70 basis points, all of which drove 400 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion to 13.4% versus 9.4% in q one twenty four and eleven point five percent in q one twenty three. Now turning to a brief review of our results. 9% top line growth was driven by better than expected performance in both direct to consumer and wholesale channels. Two third of the growth was driven by units and a third by higher AURs.

Turning to margins, we continue to see expansion in both our gross and operating margins. Gross margin for q one was 52.1 percent of net revenues, a new record. Gross margin expanded 330 basis points relative to last year, driven primarily by the continued benefit of lower product costs, favorable channel and brand mix, and higher full price selling. Adjusted SG and A expenses in the quarter were up 2% versus prior year to $744,000,000 from higher distribution expenses driven by a transition to a hybrid 3PL structure. We were pleased to see our adjusted SG and A rate of 48.7% improve after last quarter’s elevated levels, leveraging 70 basis points versus prior year.

Gross profit dollars growth outpaced the adjusted SG and A dollar increase, delivering a flow through of 84%, driving adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 400 basis points to 13.4%. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at 38, well ahead of our expectations and up 52% to prior year. We ended the quarter with reported inventory dollars up 7% to the prior year. We feel comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory and have secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders for quarter two. In the quarter, as planned, we closed 21 net stores as a system.

However, this consists of 30 new store openings, primarily full price Levi’s brand stores and 51 closures, which were mostly underperforming franchisee stores in China. Our disciplined fleet review process ensures that the doors we are opening are productive, and only the most profitable with the highest return opportunity remain open. In the quarter, we returned 81,000,000 to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which were up 12% to prior year. In quarter two, we have declared a dividend of 13¢ per share, an increase of 8% versus prior year. Now let’s review the key highlights by segment.

The Americas net revenues were up 11%, fueled by double digit growth across both direct to consumer and wholesale. In The US, net revenues were up 8% driven by high single digit growth in both channels. Our business in Mexico was up 6% from increased traffic in our stores as well as ecommerce growth. For the segment, strong gross margin and SG and A leverage led to operating margin of 21.7, improving three seventy basis points to prior year. Europe was positive for the third consecutive quarter.

Net revenues were up 3% in q one, led by double digit growth in key markets like The UK and Germany. Direct to consumer continued to accelerate this quarter, up 11%, supported by comp stores, ecommerce, and more full price sales. While wholesale shipping was down in the quarter, given the transition of our distribution center in Germany, we expect wholesale in this segment to return to growth in quarter two and have strong pre book orders, up mid to high single digits for spring and summer. Gross margin expansion drove operating margin to leverage a 20 basis points versus prior year to 25.6%. Asia net revenues increased 10% compared to prior year.

Direct to consumer net revenues were up 14, led by double digit growth in key markets like Japan, Korea, and Turkey. Our South Asia, Middle East, and Africa business, which includes India, was also up double digits this quarter as improved in store retail experiences drove higher UPT and better conversion rates in addition to growth in wholesale. This quarter, our China business was flat to prior year, and we continue to have modest expectations in ’25 as our work to reset this market is underway. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 200 basis points to last year from stronger gross margin. Now turning to our full year and quarter two guidance.

We had a strong first quarter with broad based strength across segments, channels, and categories delivering a notable beat for the quarter, and we saw solid trends continue through March. However,

Unidentified Speaker: as

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you all know, there were changes to the tariff structure announced a few days ago. Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation, and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.

Our q two outlook remains consistent with our internal plan. The impacts of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in The US. As a reminder, q two is seasonally our lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year. For quarter two, we expect organic net revenue growth from continued operations of three and a half to four and a half percent. This excludes approximately two points of foreign exchange headwinds and one and a half points attributable to the exit of Denizen and our footwear business, which implies being flat to up 1% for the quarter on a reported basis.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 basis points to a hundred basis points, and adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of five and a half percent to 6%. This translates to an adjusted diluted EPS of approximately eleven to thirteen cents, which includes around 3¢ headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate versus prior year. With this expectation, our profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, up approximately 20% versus h one twenty four. In closing, I will leave you with three thoughts. First, while the tariffs announced last week pose a significant challenge for us and the industry, our business and our brands have endured for one hundred and seventy years, proving our resilience.

Today, the Levi’s brand is stronger than ever with diversified global revenue, solid margin structure, a giant sourcing base with deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet. We are well positioned to manage through this uncertain time. Second, we delivered strong first quarter results, and we’re starting the year with momentum. Our new products are resonating and driving market share gains. We have a robust product pipeline that will fuel growth in our denim and non denim business for the rest of ’25 and beyond.

We’re making incredible progress on growing the direct to consumer channel to a longer term goal of 55% of our business while also growing wholesale. Third, we are both transforming our business while delivering strong financial results and improving our structural economics as we continue on our path to becoming a $10,000,000,000 company with 15% operating margin. I will now open up the line for q and a.

Conference Operator: You. The floor is now open for questions. Due to time constraints, the company requests that you ask only one question. If you have an additional question, please queue up again. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing 11 again.

Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Laurent?

Unidentified Speaker: Good afternoon, Michelle and Harmit. Thanks for taking our question. With tariffs front and center on everyone’s mind, can you provide a percentage breakdown of sourcing by key countries for the investors on this call? What are your suppliers saying about providing potential concessions? And then on passing some of the tariffs down the value chain, how much and when do you think you can raise pricing?

Thank you very much.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Hi, Laurent. Thanks for the question. So let me just take a step back for a minute. And obviously, the news on tariffs is very new.

It’s fluid. This was just a couple of days ago and I think we like the industry are getting our arms around it. I would say that as we enter in this period, we are coming from a place of strength. We have momentum on the business, the brand’s never been stronger and we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate.

And you’ve named a couple of them, but I’d first start with the structural changes, cost structure that we can make as part of our transformation initiative. As you know, we’ve made significant progress. You see it again in Q1 with margin expansion. So we will look there first on how we can accelerate further margin and cost opportunities. Point number two is, yes, we will work with all of our stakeholders.

That includes our vendors. It includes our customers as we assess and look at what opportunities we have. As it relates to our vendors, we’ve got long, deep relationships with many suppliers around the world. We source from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that we source into The US. I’ll speak to some of the countries in a moment.

So that is definitely an area that we’re investigating. But we’re in the very early days on that, Laurent, so I’d say more to follow. And then similarly, on pricing, as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it’ll be very surgical. As you saw even this past quarter, our average unit retail, their AURs were up again.

So the consumer is actually increasing prices. They buy up into more premium products. So that’s an opportunity. We’ve also been pulling back, especially in our DTC channel and some promotion. We had more full price selling.

So that whole area is an opportunity. So I would just say more to come. But really, we’re looking at those three areas, The cost structure, kind of the end to end stakeholder and supply chain, and then surgical pricing. And then specific to the supply chain, as I said, we have a global long tenured supply chain. We source from over 28 countries.

The places that we source from are the places you’d expect from the industry. Some of the key countries for us, in no particular order, are places like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam. Those, I’d say, are our top vendors. But it’s broad. And I’d say our supply chain is more agile today than it ever has been.

We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium, and long term.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And I think what we’ve disclosed, Laurent, into The US from China approximately 1%, into The US, from Mexico approximately 5%, and from Vietnam in the mid to high single digits into The US.

Unidentified Speaker: Very helpful. Thank you very much for your thoughts.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead, Dana.

Dana Telsey, Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group: Hi, everyone. Nice to see the progress. As you think about inventory levels, Harmit, how you planning inventory levels going forward on wholesale orders? What are you seeing from the account? And Michelle, given the Beyonce campaign and some of the other activations and collaboration, women’s business, men’s business, how you thinking of the denim market growing?

And what should we be looking at given the linen and denim and new things coming and how you’re thinking about pricing? Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Dana, a couple of things. Inventory at the end of q one was The composition of the inventory is healthy. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for The US, we have product for spring and summer. And so that’s why, you know, we gave a guidance on quarter two.

The other thing is our quarter two includes March, and the the the trends in March are stronger than how we exited the, you know, February. So that’s that’s a perspective on that business. We’re being prudent in inventory planning. You know, as we think about the year, you know, as you think about inventory, the three things, and now the fourth that we’re keeping in mind, there was getting product in for spring and summer largely because the tariff clouds were you know, there was an overhang even a couple of months ago. The second for Europe is Red Sea disruption, and and and and the and the third was generally, you know, our thinking about about the year.

So being very prudent. As a reminder for everybody, we sell a lot of coal. Right? So a lot of our product is seasonless, and we can carry it through seasons. And our balance sheet is fairly strong.

We talked about the cash position at the end of the quarter and the access to liquidity. So we are in a good spot in a lot of ways, but we’re being prudent. To your question about wholesale orders, global wholesale was up 5%. US wholesale was up nine organically. This was the second quarter where we have seen both global wholesale and US wholesale up.

And, you know, so as we think and as we’ll as we are understanding right now, there’s been no change to there’s been no change to orders in from wholesale customers. Inventory or trade inventory is, you know, very similar to 2019 levels. Just now let me share a little bit of a perspective on wholesale in Europe. Wholesale in Europe was down in quarter one. Essentially, as I said, because we are ramping up our distribution center, we expect wholesale to return to growth in quarter two.

The indicate best indication of wholesale demand in Europe is prebook, which for spring and summer is positive, and for fall is positive right now. And I think the second question, Michelle, she asked you about the denim category.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. So, Dana, thanks for the question. And I think to echo what we said in remarks, we’re really pleased with the start of the year, and the Levi’s brand has never been stronger. So Levi’s brand was at 8% in the quarter. And I think to your question, we’re seeing gains in both men and women, both in market share and in equity.

So specific to the Beyonce campaign, 4,300,000,000 press impressions, more than 65,000,000 in media value alone. But I think importantly, it’s creating a nice tailwind to everything else that we’re doing. Specific to, as we think about our transformation, we must preserve and drive the leadership position in men’s. But our intention has been to accelerate with women’s because we’re under shared there. Women’s is now 38% of our business.

Q1 was our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Like I said, we are now firmly in the number one position market share in The US, and we’re growing that, which is really exciting. Women’s was up 12% overall across all channels and geographies. And then if you look at DTC, which is really the leading indicator, up 16% in the quarter and really delivering on that head to toe lifestyle. So as we pivot from jeans to becoming DTC, becoming head to toe, we’re seeing that in our DTC results, up 12%, and we’re seeing that in women’s and in lifestyle.

So like I said, women’s up 16 and both bottoms and tops growing. The team is really nailing it in terms of driving trends and fashion fit. Diversifying the fit opportunity to strengthen loose and baggy continues, but our core remains strong. Western wear continues to trend. The list goes on.

But even in times like these, when it’s turbulent, we’re going to lean in and please our fans with delivering the highest quality product. It’s a great value and deliver that innovation. Thank you. Thanks, Dana.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead,

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Matt. Thank you.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: So Michelle, could you elaborate on key drivers of the 9% organic growth, maybe consumer demand and market share trends that you’re seeing in The Americas? And Harmit, if you could maybe speak to the cadence of gross margin in the second quarter relative to the back half?

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Sure. Great. So I can start. I mean, one of the things, Matt, that we’re really proud of the team’s efforts this quarter is really across the board, we saw strength. So if you take our geographies as an example, so our total organic revenue is up nine percent.

We saw strength in The Americas, in Europe, and in Asia, and beyond yoga, I would say, as well, as that carries forward another quarter of double digit growth. The channels both channels were positive. DTC up 12. 12 quarter of positive growth, can speak to that in a moment, as well as our wholesale business up 5%. And I’d say it’s particular strength in US wholesale.

And then if I really double click under DTC, because the 9%, clearly the 12% is what’s fueling the majority of that. It’s now 52% of our business. As you know, our long term goal that we’ve put out there is to be at least 55%, so we’re making great progress. But if you think about DTC and look at some of the the KPIs, the key metrics there, as it relates to our owned and operated stores, positive comp sales. We saw positive traffic.

We saw positive conversion, and we saw positive AURs. E commerce up 16%, again, positive traffic, conversion, and AURs. And so when you think about this, the growth is healthy and it’s sustainable. We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about twothree of the business, and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up onethree. So this, as we look at the trends, feel like it’s sustainable.

And it’s all coming off of the back of our key strategies. When we say DTC first, denim lifestyle, winning with women, we’re seeing that across the board. And then your second part of your question was around market share. And as I think I mentioned even in my earlier remarks, we’re really pleased to see the growth we are seeing there. Both men’s and women’s grew market share in The US this past quarter, number one in both positions across both genders.

And the other piece that we’re seeing nice momentum and growth is growing market share with youth, that eighteen to thirty year old target customer, as well as the premium consumer. So there’s just there’s just, a lot to like and a lot of momentum we’re seeing across all of our segments of the business.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And, Matt, to your question of gross margin, which to me is a great indicator of how the brand’s doing, record gross margins in quarter one at 62.1. I think the best way to think about it is half is driven by product costs, which are not truly just straight vendor negotiation. As part of our transformation efforts, we’ll you know, we’re taking a hard look at SKUs. We have reduced our SKUs. You know, we’re taking a hard look at assortments that are not as productive, as well as our newer innovations are great margins.

So that’s one piece of it. And the other half, I would say, is a combination of mix, which is higher women’s, higher DTC, higher international, higher full price selling that Michelle referred to. There’s a there’s a real focus given that our products are hitting home. We drive higher full price selling, and we had favorable effects given our, you know, hedging strategy. Similar in for q q two.

So q two reflected margins would be up 80 to a hundred basis points, again, driven by this. And on a full year basis, a hundred basis points. To your question about cadence, first half versus second half, the first half is really strong. The second half, because our margin structure was very strong a year ago, the second half will be muted. Still up, but, you know, much lower than the first half.

And, you know, obviously, we are focused on driving more full price selling. It’s something that is difficult to predict. That’s why, you know, we continue to beat margins. I mean and the other reason that’s driving higher margin is the wonderful DTC business is higher gross margin.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great color. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Matt.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead, Jay.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Great. Thank you so much. Maybe just on the guidance for Q2, can you give us a sense of for that organic net revenue growth, how you see that by region?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So, similar, Jay, I would say, you know, The US low to mid single digit, as you think about, you know, q two. Europe, probably mid single digit with one difference. Wholesale should return to growth given what I indicated in Asia. Again, mid single digit.

If you think of channels, BDC, you know, I would say high single digit. And global wholesale, flat to slightly up is the general thinking at this stage.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Got it. Alright. Great. Thank you so much.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Jay.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Ike.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Harmit, I think two for you. Just can you walk us through the expense deleverage that looks to be implied in the 2Q after getting some pretty good leverage in 1Q? And then it looks like the back half should go back to kind of getting nice leverage to flat.

Just what exactly are the spending dynamics kind of taking place in the second quarter? And then bigger picture for you, it sounds like there’s no revenue issues for the business at all right now. But at least over the past couple of weeks, it might be helpful. Could you talk about the brand overseas? I think there’s some growing narrative about anti American response to US brands that there is a risk to what’s going on geopolitically.

Would love to hear if you’re seeing any of that or if there’s any noteworthy developments that you’ve come across in the past couple of weeks. Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Right. So I’ll Ike, I’ll I’ll try and do this in a speed round. Right now, international business is fairly strong. We are not seeing any any impact internationally. From our perspective, you know, we’ve been here for a long, long time.

Internationally, you know, as a business, we’ve been around for, you know, over eighty years. So we’re not seeing it. You know, we’re in friends with the local consumers, connecting really well. And our new product offers that Michelle referred to are generally doing well. To your question about the quarter two guidance, so quarter two, just as a reminder, is largely, you know, is our lowest volume quarter just from the seasonality.

First quarter has December holiday. Third quarter has back to school, and the fourth quarter has the beginning of holidays. The second quarter, So seasonally, it’s the lowest quarter. In terms of SG and A increase, the first quarter was up two. We expect the second quarter to be up three.

SG and and A as a rate is in the mid fifties. It was around under 50. We still expect SG and A for the year to be around 50%, and this is prior to any actions that we take, as Michelle referred to, you know, to mitigate actions on tariff, etcetera. And the EPS decline relative to last year is primarily driven by foreign exchange and higher tax. You know, even though foreign exchange rates have improved a little from the last quarter, they’re very volatile.

They go up and down. And so our perspective is FX and higher tax will probably impact EPS adversely by about 3, you know, 3¢. But structurally, the business is in good standing. You know, gross margins, you know, we expect to be up, and organic rate to be up three and a half, 4%. You know, think of our reported revenue reported revenue in quarter two, I said it’s flat to slightly up.

And so that’s what the deleverage in terms of EBIT percentage.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Harmit is saying is just when you think about the whole year, know, we’re we’re obviously thinking about our strategy is to drive the top line. We’ll get some leverage there and drive margin expansion, both in gross margin over the year and in EBIT margin. And as you know, we saw progress from 2024 over 2023, and we’ve guided the year to see another level of expansion there as well. All this, of course, does not yet reflect the tariffs.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Ike.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Nardone of BofA. Please go ahead,

Chris Nardone, Analyst, BofA: Great, guys. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow ups. First on U. S.

Wholesale, can you just clarify whether your guidance is implying positive or negative growth for the remainder of this year? And then looking out, it sounds like you benefited from expanding into some newer wholesale distribution points in the first quarter. How big is this opportunity over the medium term? And do you need growth in U. S.

Wholesale to reach your medium term EBIT margin targets?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: So Chris, we’ve had two great quarters in wholesale. US and the team, big shout out to them. They’ve delivered US wholesale growth in the first two quarters. I indicated, I think, in the earlier question, q two globally, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly up. Our expectation in US wholesale right now, we continue to be prudent, and so we think, you know, a flat number is a good number at this stage.

Obviously, we’re another quarter under the belt. We’ll we’ll talk about the the full year from that perspective. On the distribution, you are right. You know, our opportunities on distribution in The US is primarily around the categories we are growing DDC. We think we have an opportunity in women’s.

We think we we have an opportunity in tops. And as you know, you know, after the exit of Denizen and Target, we are working with our customers, in this case, Target, to try and grow our Levi’s business, and that’s making a difference. So as we think about opportunities of distribution and wholesale, there are opportunities around the company, especially as we grow the categories and, you know, both gender, women and men’s, as Michelle referred to, and the different categories as a pivot to a denim lifestyle company.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Please go ahead,

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Hi, thanks. Michelle and Harmit, in the past, what are your thoughts around frameworks around pricing? And also, when you look at tariffs in the past, what percentage did you absorb versus share with customers in different ways? As we look forward, if you pricing has been something that you’ve adjusted in the past and recently in terms of being prices being too high. So would you take lower margins in terms of offering the consumer a good value?

I know there’s a very dynamic situation here with tariffs and inflation.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Oliver, I’ll take that. Thanks for the question. I mean, think the word you just said is very appropriate, which is it is very dynamic right now. I mean, we’re literally this this whole situation is just a couple of days old, as you know, and I think both Harmeet and I mentioned we’ve got a really talented team right now who’s dissecting the problem and looking at all the levers that we have to address the issue, two of which you just hit on, which is we will work with our vendors, with our customers to understand the best way forward.

And then pricing is a potential lever. Would say as we think about it, we will very much think about any pricing if we do take pricing very surgically. Number one, one of the things we’ve seen our consumer do is they’re actually driving price up. We saw our AURs again this quarter increase as they gravitate to more premium products. So we expect that to continue.

There could be more pricing power in our more premium products. So we’ll look at that. Promotions. We have been surgically pulling back more in DTC, I would say, on promotions and achieving more full price selling. So that is something that

We can test pricing in our DTC channel. That’s something that we can more easily do and understand the elasticity. We have recent experience, for example, in Mexico where we successfully took some price adjustments based on the tariffs there. And then what I would say overall as we think about the Levi’s brand, we address today a broad range of price points. If you start at the core of our product, we’re at a very accessible price point in that $40.50 dollars range.

Then we do compete in the value segment with signature. It’s largely offered in some of the mass channels. That’s doing really well. We were up 19% this quarter. And then we go high end, the way from, I’ll call it, our tier two, which is in our mainline stores.

You’re seeing more and more on that of ecom. That’s where we’re in the $90.100 dollars range. And then even upwards of $200.300 dollars with Tier one and our new Blue Cab. So I share that in the spirit of we have a lot to work with here to determine what is going to be our right path forward. But it’s gonna be really important for us to be super sensitive to the consumer and make sure that we’re on the right path.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. And Harmine, can you get inventory faster, like, now in order to address what’s happening? Or what happened with the inventory you have on hand relative to the win and the the methodology for inventory valuation that we should know about with timing of prices relative to the cost of goods sold?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. I mean, Oliver, we’re looking at all options right now. You know, I’m sure a lot of our partners and vendors are being called, you know, and so we’re looking at options. We’ve been able to successfully air freight, you know, in the past when we were chasing product. The fact that we have inventory for spring and summer is a good indication.

We’re also working on a faster go to market calendar, especially for the newer products. So, you know, we’re doing everything that we can within our means. And to your question about, you know, cost accounting and, you know, depending on where tariffs it totally depends where tariffs settle. It’s such a fluid situation, and so we’re working through it.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. Thanks. Best regards.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Oliver.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead, Paul.

Unidentified Speaker: Hey, thanks guys. Can you tell you’re thinking about the various macro backdrops of the major regions that you operate in and also how you’re looking at the competitive landscape currently? You’re seeing any changes in terms of promotions, either increasing or decreasing, and just, you know, sort of what is the the backdrop that that you’re you’re thinking about by by your major regions? Thanks.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So the good news, Paul, is, you know, q one is a good indication of the momentum of the brand. The growth was broad based. All regions were up. You know, Europe was up only three, but on an organic basis, because that was driven by the ramp up in our distribution center.

And so as we think across the world, you know, Europe, Third consecutive quarter of growth. US, Fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Mexico, Second consecutive quarter of growth. Asia, up, you know, double digits. So, generally, the momentum is strong from that perspective.

Being global and 60% international, I think, will make a difference, at least from that perspective. Consumer, generally resilient across the world. They’re responding to our new products. You know, our products offer great value, as Michelle referenced. So we’re feeling generally good from that perspective.

Unidentified Speaker: Any changes on the promotional front? That

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you Yeah. And promotions, actually, we are tightening promotions. I mean, that’s why the focus on full price sales, you can see it in margins. So we’re not necessarily going the other way at this stage because the consumer is not giving us giving us a reason for a change. And because inventories are generally in a good spot, there’s no reason to push that down faster, push price down faster.

Unidentified Speaker: Great. Thanks, Henry. Good luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Paul.

Conference Operator: Comes from Brook Roach.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about your playbook should the macro environment worsen. What’s the cost structure of your business today? How much is fixed versus variable? And how much additional SG and A leverage can you drive this year to offset higher product costs if the macro environment worsens materially?

Unidentified Speaker: Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: It’s all it’s all being planned right now, Brooke. I think the best best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is is 2020 and ’21, which is which was COVID. At that point, our view was, you know, fixed and variable. You know, I’d say between sixty five and seventy fixed, the rest variable. You know?

And variable, I’d also add incentives available, for example. But, you know, it’s the last thing you want to touch, especially when there’s so much momentum in the brand, I’ll put it there. I think as you think about our stores, very similar cost structure, but even then, we actually grew our store base. You know, we kept adding stores. And so, you know, we’re thinking through it.

We’re putting everything on the table right now as we think through the three levers, which is, you know, cost initiatives without compromising the long term, stakeholder management discussions, which is customers and our vendor partners, and the third is pricing, you know, options and initiatives. And so we are looking at all options, Brooke. And then we have an international business that’s very strong. Right? That could also be you know, we can drive some momentum there to offset some softness, if any, in The US.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you. Thank you, Brooke.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining our call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements.
But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook.
But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this.
Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history.","Let's take a look at what's trending after hours. We want to talk about Levi's, the denim company. Those shares are moving higher after it delivered a beat on first quarter earnings. The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements. So that's really important here, um, that I I want to emphasize here. The company's saying in a statement, Harmit Singh, who is the chief financial and growth officer, says, we're maintaining our forecast, which seems like a good thing. But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook. Um, Kenny Polcari, you are still with me here, and I have been I've been looking very closely at companies like this, because obviously Levi's sources a lot of its stuff from outside the US and is subject to tariffs. So you see a statement like this, and at first you say, oh, they're maintaining. That's a good thing. We're excluding all tariffs, though. Is that just because they can't

Well quantify it at this time. if they can't quantify it, but that then leaves open the door, while it sounds positive. They said they've just said we're excluding the tariffs, suggesting we can't quantify it, so we may have more negative news down the line. But the market is not taking it that way. I mean it's up a little bit. What's it up, 2% in the after hours, um, although it is down 34% in the last year. So maybe there's a little bit of a push to, but it's going to be interesting to see if there's any other further clarification, if someone starts calling them out asking them for you know, for more clarification.

It feels that way. Yeah. Right. Yes. Well, I mean, the conference calls is going to be real interesting in that regard. I am sure that analysts are going to push them on a potential tariff effect. But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this. We're going to get um forecasts from many of them, or Right.

We won't get any. Right.

We won't get any, because they say we just don't know. What is the and what is the tariff going to be? I have no idea. Right.

And I think if you have a lot of them that say they're not going to forecast or they can't tell, that's going to be a negative, right? People are going to take it as a negative, because they're going to lose they're going to lose the guidance. They're not going to know which way to go. So that would, in my mind, it would cause uh it would cause the market to become weaker, or at least their stock to become weaker. Um, but then if we keep hearing that with more and more companies, then you know, it'll have a more broader effect.

You said this, though. Yeah. Yes, exactly. You know, we've been asking a lot of people today what they're expecting for earning season. We didn't have a chance to ask you, so.

So I so I think already, listen, I think that when we came into the year, it was supposed to be 12% year-over-year growth. I think that's been whittled back down to 7%. We've seen, you know, uh as they as they modify coming into the end of the quarter. Uh so I think that's I think I'm comfortable saying that I think that's about what it's going to be. And to Keith's point, where he said you're going to see probably a 70% B grade, which is kind of It's the game that they all play. Yes. the number, right? Right. So they they lower the numbers and then they beat it. They go, oh, look, we beat it. I got it, great. Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history. When they report their history It's history. It is really about what they say going forward, and this quarter is going to be very important about what they say going forward.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UjNpulZk93jf4INRqhsn0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/81221d90-13f4-11f0-bf7f-e67618f85d32,N,,2025-04-07 19:05:44.936909

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate.
Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.
Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.
“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale.","Momentum has got to count for something — in sports and fashion.

“We had a strong quarter,” said Michelle Gass, president and chief executive officer of Levi Strauss & Co., in an interview on first-quarter results. “[Organic] sales up 9 percent kicks off 2025 in a very strong way. But not only sales, our margins were up. It’s another proof point that our transformation is working.”

But this is also one of those moments when the past has a lighter grip on the present and the future is all the more uncertain.

U.S. President Donald Trump moved on from sniping at China to launching a global trade war last week, adding on 10 percent tariffs on goods from nearly every other country. And some have been hit with much higher rates including China, which is being hit with an additional 34 percent tariff.

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate. “We — and the entire industry — are facing a tremendous amount of uncertainty at this moment.”

In addition to some momentum, Levi’s has been cutting costs as it moves to a stronger direct-to-consumer stance and is also cushioned by its international business, which accounts for 60 percent of sales.

Levi’s sources from 28 countries, including China (which accounts for only 1 percent of product), Mexico (5 percent) and Vietnam (a single-digit percentage). The rest of Levi’s goods come mostly from other countries in Asia.

But there’s really no global supply chain in fashion that could skirt Trump’s tariffs.

Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.

“We’ve already been on the path to improve the structural economics of the business,” said Gass, referring to work that has seen Levi’s cut costs over the past year or so. “We will look to accelerate that and then we will work with all of our partners. And if we do take pricing, we’re going to do that very surgically. No decisions have been made.”

The speed of events on the ground — Trump, for instance, threatened China with another 50 percent tariff on Monday — makes it hard to settle on any decision.

So for now Levi’s, like the rest of fashion, is planning and watching the market closely.

First-quarter sales rose 3 percent to $1.5 billion, but were up 9 percent on an organic basis, which excludes currency fluctuations, the closed footwear and Denizen businesses and the Dockers business, which is now classified as a discontinued operation.

Net income tallied $135 million, or 34 cents a share, up from losses of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi’s ended the quarter with $574 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion.

Harmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer, called that “a very good spot” to be in.

The company is holding Dockers for sale and was said to be in exclusive talks with brand management firm Marquee Brands. But sources said that period of exclusivity expired just as the market hit its tariff crisis, making it difficult to value the brand in the current environment.

“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale. “There are a couple of prospective buyers. We are in the middle of the sale process and it is confidential right now.”

He said the company was confident that a deal would close “sometime in 2025.”

If the uncertainty in the market has complicated the Dockers sale, Gass said Levi’s mission was still clear despite a volatile world.

“There is uncertainty at times like these,” the CEO said. “Levi’s is the type of brand that people will go to. They are going to go to brands that they trust, and we stand for the things that are really important in uncertain times, which is quality, value, taking care of our consumer. We’re going to continue to focus on great execution and operate against our playbook. That playbook is working.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Michelle_Gass_Levis.jpg?crop=0px%2C726px%2C1997px%2C1119px&resize=1000%2C563,N,,2025-04-07 18:10:54.948675

CEO notes 'uncertain environment' but touts an 'agile supply chain'

Levi Strauss & Co. on Monday reported a higher adjusted quarterly profit than Wall Street expected, and the denim and jeans maker said it was sticking with its full-year outlook - one that doesn't include the potential impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The company said it still expects a sales drop of 1% to 2% for its fiscal year, which is set to run through November, with adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 a share. That forecast, Levi's (LEVI) said, excluded any hit from ""the recent tariff announcements."" But it said it expected ""minimal impact"" to its margin expectations for the second quarter.

Levi's reported fiscal first-quarter sales of $1.53 billion, up 3% year over year. It reported adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected Levi Strauss to report adjusted earnings of 28 cents a share for its first quarter, which ended on March 2. They expected sales of $1.54 billion.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said in a statement.

Shares rose 3.1% after hours.

The financials included in Levi's earnings release excluded $67 million in sales related to Dockers, which the company now considers ""discontinued operations.""

The company has been trying to sell its Dockers business, amid efforts to lower costs and focus more on newer jeans and other denim items. Levi's has tried to retain inflation-fatigued consumers' interest with a partnership with Beyoncé.

Levi's reported the results as new tariffs announced last week by Trump continue to roil markets. Meanwhile, jeans could be targeted for steeper trade retaliation by the European Union.

Morningstar analyst David Swartz, in a note last week, said Trump's tariffs had ""significant implications"" for clothing makers. He noted that nearly all the clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mainly from Asia.

Levi's, in its most recent annual report, said that in its last fiscal year, it got its products from manufacturers in nearly 30 nations. No more than 30% came from any one country, that report said. The company said it sourced products from North and South Asia, the Americas, including the United States, as well as Europe and Africa. And it said that of the items it sells in the U.S., ""less than 1% are directly sourced and manufactured in China.""

Even before Trump's announcement, Levi's had forecast falling sales for its fiscal year. In January, management said ""there continues to be a lot of uncertainty related to the macro environment, potential tariffs, changes in the tax code, as well as worsening foreign exchange.""

The stock is down some 34% over the past 12 months.

Shares of the company, down about 22% this year, rose about 2% in extended trading as Levi maintained its full-year forecasts for sales and profit, which did not account for any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

The retailer has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up — a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch ANF and Gap GAP — despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

The company's finance chief, Harmit Singh, has in the past noted that a diverse supply chain with sourcing from over 25 countries gave Levi an edge over other retailers at a time when tariff risks have hit footwear and apparel retailers from Nike NKE to Target TGT.

""The company's celebrity partnerships, marketing efforts, and strong product pipeline are helping it to win over shoppers despite growing uncertainty — which bodes well for its ability to navigate an increasingly challenging macro-environment,"" said eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% for the three months ended March 2, from 58.8% last year, driven by lower product costs and a strong direct-to-consumer channel.

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

""Dockers is a business that we're currently in a competitive process to sell sometime in 2025,"" CFO Singh told Reuters.

The company's quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 38 cents per share, compared to estimates of 28 cents.

About Levi Strauss & Co. Levi Strauss & Co.
References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.
We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment.
Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income.","Operating margin was 12.5% compared to 0.04% in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 basis points to 13.4% from 9.4% last year on a reported basis primarily due to higher gross margin.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% from 58.8% in Q1 2024 primarily driven by lower product costs and favorable channel and brand mix.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $749 million compared to $756 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted SG&A was up 1.7% to $744 million compared to $731 million last year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was 48.7% compared to 49.4% last year.

Restructuring charges were $7 million related to Project Fuel.

Interest and other expenses, net, which include foreign exchange losses, were $15 million in the aggregate compared to $12 million in Q1 2024.

The effective income tax rate was 20.6%, compared to 15.9% in Q1 2024.

Net income from continuing operations was $140 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $10 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted net income was $150 million compared to $100 million in Q1 2024.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.35 compared to diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.03 in Q1 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.38 compared to $0.25 in Q1 2024.

Additional information regarding Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Adjusted free cash flow as well as amounts presented on an organic net revenues basis and constant-currency basis, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, is provided at the end of this press release.

Balance Sheet Review as of March 2, 2025

Cash and cash equivalents were $574 million, while total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion.

Total inventories increased 7% on a dollar basis. We have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for Q2.

Shareholder Returns

The company returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, a 12% increase over prior year, including:

Dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of $0.13 per share.

Share repurchases of $30 million, reflecting 1.6 million shares retired.

As of March 2, 2025, the company had $560 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date.

The company has declared a dividend of $0.13 per share totaling approximately $51 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 9, to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April 24.

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Words such as, but not limited to, ""believe,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""so we can,"" ""when,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""project,"" ""could"" and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Investors should consider the information contained in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024 especially in the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"", ""Summary of Risk Factors"" and ""Risk Factors"" sections and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 2, 2025, especially in the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"", section. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this press release and related conference call may not occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated or, if no date is stated, as of the date of this press release and related conference call.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See ""RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES"" below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted Net Income and Constant-Currency and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Discontinued Operations - Dockers®

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced we were undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives to the global Dockers® business, including a sale or other strategic transactions. During the first quarter of 2025, we commenced a sale process of the Dockers® business with the target of completing a transaction in fiscal year 2025. As of March 2, 2025, we determined the Dockers® business met held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. The supplemental table below includes our 2024 results recast for continuing and discontinued operations.

Management's Perspective

Michelle Gass, President and CEO, stated, ""We exceeded revenue and profitability expectations in Q1, marking a strong start to the year. The Levi’s® brand is stronger than ever, and we will continue to fuel this momentum through a robust product pipeline and by keeping the brand firmly at the center of culture across the globe.""

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, added, ""We delivered significant margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth in the first quarter. Looking forward, we are maintaining our 2025 top- and bottom-line guidance, excluding any impact from the recent tariff announcements.""

Future Outlook

The company maintained its fiscal 2025 guidance, expecting organic net revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and reported net revenue to decrease by 1% to 2%. The gross margin is anticipated to expand by 100 basis points to approximately 61.6%. The adjusted EBIT margin is expected to expand to 11.4% to 11.6%, with an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.

Levi Strauss said fiscal first-quarter revenue rose, boosted by the U.S. market, and kept its outlook for the year unchanged but excluded the impact of higher tariffs from its guidance.

The apparel retailer on Monday swung to a profit for the three months ended March 2 of $135 million, or 34 cents a share, from a loss of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.

Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings per-share came in at 38 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 28 cents.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said.

Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million of revenue from Dockers after being reclassified as a discontinued brand, and boosted by a 6% increase across its core Americas region. Overall, direct-to-consumer revenue increased 9%, while wholesale fell 3%. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast total revenue of $1.54 billion.

In the U.S., revenue rose 8% on an organic basis after logging high-single digit growth in both its direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses.

The company kept its outlook for fiscal 2025 unchanged, excluding the impact from President Trump's latest round of tariffs, but said it expects a minimal impact to its second-quarter outlook.

Levi's guidance also doesn't assume any significant worsening macro-economic pressure on the consumer.

The company expects a drop in full-year revenue of 1% to 2%, and adjusted earnings between $1.20 to $1.25.

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted Net Income and Constant-Currency and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Discontinued Operations - Dockers®

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced we were undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives to the global Dockers® business, including a sale or other strategic transactions. During the first quarter of 2025, we commenced a sale process of the Dockers® business with the target of completing a transaction in fiscal year 2025. As of March 2, 2025, we determined the Dockers® business met held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. The supplemental table below includes our 2024 results recast for continuing and discontinued operations.

The company’s quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have increased on a year-over-year basis.

Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.

In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily aided by a rise in fee revenues and net interest income (NII) alongside lower provisions and non-interest expenses. Also, higher assets under custody and/or administration and assets under management balances were positives.

BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 8.01%.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quote

The consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, which has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days. This indicates a rise of 15.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.73 billion, implying 4.5% growth.

Factors to Impact BNY Mellon’s Q1 Results

Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fees (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $2.37 billion.

The consensus mark for financing-related fees stands at $54.7 million, which suggests a 4.1% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $54.3 million.

The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $39 million, implying a 7.1% decline. Our estimate for the same is $41.6 million.

In the first quarter, foreign exchange (FX) trading activity was driven by heightened market volatility and increased hedging demand amid global economic uncertainties. Further, higher-for-longer interest rates and concerns regarding a potential trade war, given Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened the dollar. Thus, increased FX trading volumes are likely to have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s FX revenues, partially offset by a weak dollar performance. The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues stands at $181.8 million, suggesting a jump of 19.6%. Our estimate for the same is $176.5 million.

The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is $3.44 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.1%. We project the metric to be $3.60 billion.

NII: The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during the first quarter of 2025 amid sticky inflation concerns. This is likely to have positively impacted BK’s NII during the first quarter, given relatively higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs.

Further, the yield curve steepened during the quarter due to economic uncertainties, which is likely to have offered further support for reinvestment yields.

However, a cautious stance regarding future rate cuts by the Fed and a tough operating backdrop is likely to have subdued the overall lending scenario to some extent. Per the latest Fed data, overall loan demand improved in the first two months of the quarter.

The consensus mark for NII is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating an 8.1% year-over-year rise. We expect NII to be $1.08 billion.

Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges and buyouts, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. In the first quarter, overall costs are expected to increase, driven by inflationary pressure, technology upgrades and a multi-year transformation plan.

Our estimate for non-interest expenses is $3.38 billion, suggesting a 6.3% year-over-year rise.

The company’s quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to have increased on a year-over-year basis.

Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.

In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily aided by a rise in fee revenues and net interest income (NII) alongside lower provisions and non-interest expenses. Also, higher assets under custody and/or administration and assets under management balances were positives.

BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 8.01%.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quote

The consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, which has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days. This indicates a rise of 15.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.73 billion, implying 4.5% growth.

Factors to Impact BNY Mellon’s Q1 Results

Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fees (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $2.37 billion.

The consensus mark for financing-related fees stands at $54.7 million, which suggests a 4.1% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $54.3 million.

The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $39 million, implying a 7.1% decline. Our estimate for the same is $41.6 million.

In the first quarter, foreign exchange (FX) trading activity was driven by heightened market volatility and increased hedging demand amid global economic uncertainties. Further, higher-for-longer interest rates and concerns regarding a potential trade war, given Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened the dollar. Thus, increased FX trading volumes are likely to have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s FX revenues, partially offset by a weak dollar performance. The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues stands at $181.8 million, suggesting a jump of 19.6%. Our estimate for the same is $176.5 million.

The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is $3.44 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.1%. We project the metric to be $3.60 billion.

NII: The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during the first quarter of 2025 amid sticky inflation concerns. This is likely to have positively impacted BK’s NII during the first quarter, given relatively higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs.

Further, the yield curve steepened during the quarter due to economic uncertainties, which is likely to have offered further support for reinvestment yields.

However, a cautious stance regarding future rate cuts by the Fed and a tough operating backdrop is likely to have subdued the overall lending scenario to some extent. Per the latest Fed data, overall loan demand improved in the first two months of the quarter.

The consensus mark for NII is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating an 8.1% year-over-year rise. We expect NII to be $1.08 billion.

Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges and buyouts, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. In the first quarter, overall costs are expected to increase, driven by inflationary pressure, technology upgrades and a multi-year transformation plan.

Our estimate for non-interest expenses is $3.38 billion, suggesting a 6.3% year-over-year rise.

While President Donald Trump's tariffs will not have much direct impact on eateries, another pullback in consumer spending would hurt restaurants.

Fast-food chains have historically fared the best during economic downturns.

Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming.

U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn.

""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand,"" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 2%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

""Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Money Report

Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla, coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations.

Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons.

Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped less than 1% and 2%, respectively.

Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell 1% and shares of Wingstop sank less than 1%.

Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's, Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading.

Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants.",https://media.nbcdfw.com/2025/04/108106608-17404258302025-02-24t185956z_1297819252_rc261dagdmju_rtrmadp_0_starbucks-layoffs.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-04-07 17:08:50.964434

Dive Brief:

Visits to coffee chains of all sizes are up by 29% over the past five years, according to Placer.ai data. Small and medium-sized coffee brands have seen a disproportionate benefit, however, while industry titans like Starbucks and Dunkin’ lagged.

Small chain’s visit share rose from 3.2% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2024, while medium-sized brands, like BIGGBY Coffee and Dutch Bros, saw visit share grow from 10.8% to 17.6% in the same time.

Starbucks and Dunkin’s combined share of coffee visits remains vast — 77.9% according to Placer.ai — and visits have increased in absolute terms. But the erosion of visit share could signal vulnerability for coffee category leaders.

Dive Insight:

Consumer behavior at stores, rather than simple visit data, also sheds light on shifts in coffee’s competitive landscape.

Visits lasting longer than 10 minutes increased 13.4% at small coffee chains from 2023 to 2024, and fell at Dunkin and Starbucks by 8.9%, according to Placer.ai’s data. Short visits and long visits increased at medium-sized brands.

“Smaller coffee shops are increasingly filling the niche of a relaxed, destination-oriented experience,” Bracha Arnold, a content writer for Placer.ai, wrote in a post analyzing the data.

This consumer shift toward smaller and medium-sized chains as coffee-oriented “third places” could help explain why Starbucks, after years of emphasis on speed and throughput, is returning its focus to in-store experience under CEO Brian Niccol. That move may be necessary to preserve the brand’s position in the market from competition from smaller, more local-feeling coffee shops.

“These shifts highlight the different needs that coffee shops can fill within a community, with some offering speed and convenience, while others can meet the desire for a relaxed and personalized coffee experience,” Arnold wrote in the report.

Arnold noted that coffee traffic growth slowed in late 2024, which could signal a plateau in consumer demand.

One of the many complaints and reasons for this decline is consumers' dislike of Starbucks' prices, which tend to be higher than those of most coffee shops and have risen over the years due to inflation and extra charges for customizations.

Since taking over as Starbucks' CEO, Brian Niccol has emphasized the need to bring the company back to its roots by focusing on its core products, personalizing the coffee shop experience like it once did, and keeping prices from increasing.

""I made a commitment that we’d get back to Starbucks, focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart – a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas,"" said Niccol in an earnings call.

Starbucks' turnaround plan is threatened by tariffs

To return the business to growth, Starbucks (SBUX) developed a turnaround strategy that aims to improve customers' overall experience by redesigning stores, optimizing efficiency, prioritizing coffee quality, simplifying its menu, and keeping prices from elevating in 2025.

Starbucks has tried to freeze prices by eliminating extra charges for milk alternatives, reducing customization options, discontinuing menu items, and providing free refills for those who consume in stores.

However, President Donald Trump's new tariffs could make Starbucks' goal of price-freezing without risking further profit losses even more challenging.

President Trump announced in February that he would implement a 25% additional tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, a 10% tariff on China, and a 10% levy.

However, on Apr. 2, President Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices created a national emergency. He implemented new tariffs on products imported into the U.S. from many countries, including an additional 10% baseline tariff.

President Trump claims that these newly imposed tariffs aim to combat this concern by encouraging the production and purchasing of American-based products, which will increase competitive edge, protect sovereignty, and strengthen national and economic security.

Starbucks' main product faces challenges amid tariff implementations

Although Starbucks is an American company, most of its coffee is imported from over 30 different countries worldwide. Since more than 70 countries are coffee producers, only around 1% of all coffee consumed in the U.S. is made within the country.

Starbucks sources coffee from the three main regions that produce it: Latin America, Africa, and Asia/Pacific. Asia is one of the regions with the highest tariffs, and Vietnam is one of Starbucks' top suppliers, now facing a 46% tariff on goods imported into the U.S.

Many companies from all sectors are concerned about the negative financial repercussions the implementation of these tariffs could have on their businesses since some are highly dependent on imported goods from these select countries, including Starbucks, whose coffee beans make up around 10% to 15% of its production and distribution costs.

Dear fellow stockholders:

We help 185 million Americans live their healthiest lives possible. It is a privilege to lead CVS Health®, and more importantly, to work with our more than 300,000 colleagues to deliver simply better health.

Our job has never been more important: improve the well-being of individuals across the country by making health care more accessible, simple and aﬀordable. Our unmatched combination of businesses and extensive consumer reach uniquely position CVS Health to help deﬁne the future of health care.

I am honored to have been appointed president and chief executive oﬃcer in October 2024. In many roles throughout my 39 years in our industry, I've had none more meaningful than the one I have now, supporting our colleagues as they work to improve the health of millions of people.

The health care industry is challenging and complex, but our commitment to care never wavers. From ensuring a child had access to their anti-seizure medication during a hurricane, to supporting a member through a complex transplant surgery so they could attend their son's wedding… we are there for the moments that matter most. Each of our businesses plays a critical role in achieving our mission and supporting the health of Americans. Every day, we are working hard to become America's leading and most trusted health care company.

In 2024, we generated $372.8 billion in revenue and delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.66 with adjusted earnings per share of $5.42.* Despite the challenges last year, particularly in our Aetna® business, we advanced our strategy and achieved signiﬁcant milestones.

Health Care Beneﬁts

We took decisive actions to address the long-term sustainability of our Aetna business, including product design updates that support a strong, multi-year recovery, while oﬀering members the beneﬁts that matter most. We appointed new leadership at Aetna, including a new president, chief operating oﬃcer and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, and strengthened business processes to drive improved ﬁnancial performance, while increasing transparency and accountability.

Our Medicare Advantage Stars capabilities represent a strength of the Aetna business. In 2024, Aetna achieved exceptional Star Ratings with 88 percent of our Medicare Advantage members in plans rated at least 4 Stars, and more than two-thirds of members in plans rated at least 4.5 Stars. In addition, our commitment to outstanding service resulted in our highest-ever member experience score since the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched the Quality Bonus Stars Program in 2012.

Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness

CVS Pharmacy® is America's leading pharmacy. Our focus on consumer engagement, colleague experience and operational excellence enabled us to achieve a record retail pharmacy script share in 2024. We also continue to lead the shift to a more sustainable and transparent pharmacy market with the implementation of CVS CostVantage™.

We converted all commercial prescriptions dispensed through CVS Pharmacy to this innovative economic model as of January 1, 2025. CVS CostVantage brings clarity and simplicity to retail pharmacy - the most durable and frequent interaction in the health care journey - and ensures our pharmacies are appropriately compensated for the valuable clinical services they provide.

Health Services

Our Health Services segment consists of three key businesses: CVS Caremark®, Cordavis™ and Health Care Delivery. CVS Caremark drives aﬀordability of prescription drugs. Pharmacy Beneﬁt Managers (PBMs) are the only part of the drug supply chain whose role is to lower drug costs.

In fact, CVS Caremark members have an average out-of-pocket cost of less than $8 for a 30-day prescription. Economists have estimated that PBMs generate net value of over $100 billion per year for the U.S. health care system. Clients who fully transition to our new CVS Caremark TrueCost™ model ensure members see lower costs at the pharmacy counter, including the full pass-through of the rebates we generate from our negotiations with drug manufacturers. In 2025, we saw additional momentum as clients representing more than 75 percent of CVS Caremark commercial lives chose to implement two or more elements of the CVS Caremark TrueCost model.

We continue to transform the biosimilar market and improve access and aﬀordability of costly specialty medications. By establishing co-manufacturing capacity through Cordavis and collaborating with CVS Caremark and CVS Specialty® pharmacy, we successfully converted over 90 percent of eligible HUMIRA® patients to a low-cost biosimilar, delivering almost $1 billion of net savings for our clients. These savings demonstrate the power and potential of our integrated assets.

Our Health Care Delivery businesses achieved another year of solid growth in 2024, supported by integration points across CVS Health®. Signify Health® had a record year of In-Home Health Evaluations, including nearly doubling the number of Aetna® members served.

We continue to accelerate patient growth at Oak Street Health®, increasing the number of individuals enrolled in this best-in-class care model, including the number of Aetna members. We are also bringing together existing Oak Street Health and Signify Health care delivery capabilities for use more broadly across CVS Health to improve quality of care and better manage costs.

Our impact and value

Beyond our business, we take seriously our responsibility to make a positive impact on the people and communities we serve. Our Healthy 2030 approach outlines how we are paving the way for sustainability and working toward best practices in corporate responsibility.

I believe in our mission and strategy because I believe

in my colleagues. We take on the biggest challenges

in health care because we know we can solve them

in ways no one else can. We do our best work when people need us the most, and we show up every day to create a better health care experience.

I want to say thank you to our stockholders for your continued conﬁdence in CVS Health, and I thank my colleagues for giving you every reason to believe in our future.

PART I

Item 1. Business.

Overview

CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, ""CVS Health,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us""), is a leading health solutions company building a world of health around every consumer it serves and connecting care so that it works for people wherever they are. As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,000 walk-in and primary care medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 90 million plan members and expanding specialty pharmacy solutions, and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than 800,000 patients per year. We serve an estimated more than 36 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (""PDP""). We are creating new sources of value through our integrated model allowing us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs.

The Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other.

Business Strategy

We are building a world of health around every consumer we serve, seeking to make it easier and more affordable to live a healthier life. This means delivering solutions that are more personalized, simpler to use and increasingly digital so consumers can receive care when, where and how they desire. We address holistic health _ physical, emotional, social and economic _ and we are creating new sources of value through our integrated care model which allows us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs. We believe our consumer-centric strategy will drive sustainable long-term growth and deliver value for all stakeholders.

Health Care Benefits Segment

The Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers, serving an estimated more than 36 million people as of December 31, 2024. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs and Medicaid health care management services. The Health Care Benefits segment's primary customers, its members, primarily access the segment's products and services through employer groups, government-sponsored plans or individually. The Health Care Benefits segment also serves customers who purchase products and services that are ancillary to its health insurance products.

Health Care Benefits Products and Services

The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as ""Insured"" and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as ""ASC."" Health Care Benefits segment products and services consist of the following:

• Commercial Medical: The Health Care Benefits segment offers point-of-service (""POS""), preferred provider organization (""PPO""), health maintenance organization (""HMO"") and indemnity benefit (""Indemnity"") plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts (""HSAs"") and consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to self-insure their health benefits. Under medical stop loss insurance products, the Company assumes risk for costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within an employer's plan above a pre-set annual threshold. The segment also has a portfolio of additional health products and services that complement its medical products such as dental plans, behavioral health and employee",https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,N,,2025-04-07 13:23:44.084367

Now, all eyes are on key inflation data, Federal Reserve signals and Big Bank earnings as traders search for footing in a week that could redefine the market’s path forward.

Inflation and Tariffs in Focus

With global markets under intense scrutiny, investors are turning their attention to key economic reports this week, starting with Thursday’s release of the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Friday’s Producer Price Index (PPI), both critical gauges of inflation.

Wells Fargo economists predict that inflation will remain stable in March, continuing the trend of easing pressures observed in recent months. February’s CPI, in particular, surprised many with a sharper-than-expected drop, fueling optimism about moderating price increases.

As these reports loom, attention will also shift to the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes, set to be released on Wednesday.

Market participants will look for any hints regarding the central bank’s next moves on interest rates. Additionally, remarks from Fed officials in the coming days are expected to shed further light on the broader economic outlook.

Alongside inflation data, consumer sentiment and credit reports will offer a fuller picture of economic health. On Tuesday, the NFIB small business optimism index will provide insight into the confidence of one of the most vital segments of the U.S. economy.

Big Banks Kick Off Earning Season

The first-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week, with reports from major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon, scheduled for Friday.

JPMorgan Chase, the world’s largest bank by market capitalization, will set the tone for the sector.

Investors will be looking for updates on the bank’s strong performance from the previous quarter, which saw a surprising surge in profits driven by growth in investment banking revenue and net interest income.

On the same day, BlackRock will also report its earnings following a record-breaking quarter for assets under management.

Investors are particularly keen on updates on the firm’s ambitious $30 billion AI infrastructure initiative, which involves major partners like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Elon Musk’s xAI.

Other major earnings this week include Delta Air Lines on Wednesday, CarMax on Thursday and Levi Strauss and Cal-Maine Foods later in the week.

As investors closely monitor these reports, many will be looking for insights into how the broader economy—including the ongoing impacts of tariffs and inflation—is affecting various sectors.

Eyes on Gold and VIX

Gold (XAU/USD) saw modest buying near $2,972 early Monday, halting its pullback from last week’s record high.

Safe-haven demand was driven by global market turmoil following President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and continued buying by China’s central bank, which has now purchased gold for five consecutive months.

Falling Treasury yields—amid expectations the Fed may resume rate cuts—supported gold, while a weaker USD added to the metal’s appeal. However, long-position liquidation to cover broader market losses has capped upside momentum.

At the same time, the Volatility Index (VIX) surged by 50%, reaching 50 and breaching key resistance levels, signaling heightened market stress. The 10-year Treasury yield also fell sharply, dropping below 4.16% and nearing significant support at 3.90%.

The widening divergence between the VIX and Treasury yields highlights deepening concerns about market instability.

Both Gold and VIX will be key indicators to watch closely this week as they could signal further market movements.",https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key-economic-indicators-markets-rattled-tariffs-us-inflation-big-bank-earnings_cropped.webp,N,,2025-04-07 12:15:30.477542

Chief Commercial Officer Matt Klein is also leaving and will be succeeded by insider Rana Ghosh.

The departures come as the carrier works to move away from its no-frills image and rebrand itself as a premium airline.

An interim office of the CEO, consisting of Chief Financial Officer Fred Cromer, Chief Operating Officer John Bendoraitis and General Counsel Thomas Canfield, will lead the company until a new chief is named.

Christie joined Spirit in 2012 as its finance chief and took the helm in 2019.

He guided the airline through the pandemic disruptions and a challenging period for low-cost carriers grappling with rising costs and a readiness among travelers to pay extra for a more comfortable journey as they pursued experiences.

The Florida-based carrier filed for bankruptcy protection last November, following years of losses and heavy debt, as well as failed merger attempts.

Spirit had been in merger talks with Frontier Group since at least 2022, but ended them in favor of a more attractive offer from rival JetBlue Airways.

Its merger with JetBlue was ultimately scrapped after a U.S. judge blocked it on anti-competition concerns.

Spirit, which has estimated that shift to premium would generate 13% more revenue per passenger, also plans to revamp its loyalty program and pursue alliances with other carriers.

Market Update

The Fed’s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025.

This came despite an increase in profit for the financial year, which rose from 39.72 million pounds to 66 million pounds.","The UK subsidiary of US brand Michael Kors, Michael Kors (UK) Limited, has announced plans to shutter five stores in the next fiscal year as macroeconomic conditions continue to impact consumer spending. The news was revealed in the firm’s latest annual report for the year ended 30 March 2024, filed with the UK’s Companies House.

While four stores will be closing permanently–including those in Newcastle, Milton Keyes, Manchester’s New Cathedral Street, and the concession in Harvey Nichols London–Michael Kor’s Regent Street store in London will be shuttering temporarily while “waiting for the relocation to a new near-by premises”.

In light of the plans, the company said that sales for FY25 are expected to decrease by 20 percent for both retail and e-commerce compared to 2024. Prices are also expected to drop in the “foreseeable future”, the report noted however, “in order to better meet consumer demand and counter competitors’ strategies on the market”.

Michael Kors cited “general macroeconomic conditions” as the cause for the turnover decline, particularly in regards to a reduction in customer demand. The company’s gross profit margin also fell in percentage compared to the previous year due to an “increase on markdowns aimed to push gross sales”.

This came despite an increase in profit for the financial year, which rose from 39.72 million pounds to 66 million pounds. This uptick reflected what the company said was the “sustainability” of the brand, where “despite the level of competition and the current challenges in the economic environment affecting the UK retail sector”, the UK subsidiary “continues to be a profitable business”.",https://r.fashionunited.com/r44SsYcn0xX28wMaGy-LAJDKeGFHDfk0XMwC9RtH2xg/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjQvMDkvMjMvaW1hZ2UwMDAwMS02ZjlmZmo0ci0yMDI0LTA5LTIzLmpwZWc.jpeg,N,,2025-04-07 08:04:32.477214

JD Sports is facing a 6% share dip, sparking concerns over its heavy reliance on Nike and vulnerability to US tariffs.

What does this mean?

JD Sports Fashion is in a slump, with shares dropping over 18% in the past month. The unveiling of new tariffs by US President Donald Trump anticipated a hit, dragging the FTSE 100 down by 4%. For JD, the US market is crucial, representing nearly 40% of global sales, especially after acquiring the Hibbett chain. However, over-reliance on Nike – making up 45% of sales – ties JD’s fate closely to the sportswear giant. Soaring tariffs on goods sourced from China (54%) and Vietnam (46%) add to the pressure. These tariffs impact both JD’s branded items and those of suppliers like Adidas and On. Panmure Liberum analysts predict this setback might be shared among brands and retailers, possibly reducing sector volumes.

Why should I care?

For markets: Tariff tensions hurt investor confidence.

Investor concerns are valid as tariffs disrupt and weigh down companies with strong US ties like JD Sports. With the US market vital to its strategy and a heavy dependency on Nike, unforeseen tariff developments can sharply influence market sentiments.

The bigger picture: Supply chain strains reshape fashion's future.

More broadly, trade tensions and significant tariffs hint at a shift for global supply strategies across industries.

BROWN, Getty Images",,,,,https://www.thestreet.com/retail/formerly-bankrupt-retail-healthcare-chain-may-go-bankrupt-again,"One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy.
Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.
Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018.
As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023.
Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.","It's been a very tough time to be in the retail business. Thousands of stores nationwide been closed over the past two decades because of e-commerce adoption, and the situation has accelerated since Covid forced more consumers inside and online.

Once formidable major retailers like Sears have been shuttered, and even retail store chains considered essential like pharmacy's have been stung by shifting consumer trends as competition has intensified.

It has gotten even harder to eke out a living as a retailer since inflation skyrocketed in 2022, crimping budgets. Inflation has eased a bit since then, but prices are still climbing and cash-strapped consumers have largely rotated away from discretionary purchases that retailers rely on.

In February, the Consumer Price Index showed inflation had increased to 2.8% from 2.4% last September, raising concern that prices could reignite, something even more in focus following newly instituted tariffs on imports that add more price pressures.

Worse, fears of economic recession are mounting this year as unemployment climbs.

Altogether, the backdrop has created an environment where even the strongest retailers are struggling. Weaker retailers? Well, they're on the ropes.

A retail reckoning forces companies into bankruptcy

Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows retailers to pare expenses and debt, giving them wiggle room necessary for a shot at survival. However, bankruptcy remains a last resort for companies.

Bankruptcy protection means damaged relationships with suppliers, bankers, workers, and customers. As a result, suppliers may cut off retailers, banks may not lend money necessary to operate, and workers and customers may move on to greener pastures.

Nevertheless, sometimes bankruptcy is the only option. Increasingly, that's been true for many companies.

It may be hard to believe today, but Sears ran 700 stores when it filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Bed Bath & Beyond had 1,500 stores in 2018, but fewer than 300 in 2023 when it went bankrupt, and none are open anymore. Christmas Tree Shops operated more than 80 stores before all were closed when it went bankrupt.

The economy has certainly been a driving force behind the retail reckoning, but fierce competition hasn't helped.

Walmart, Target, and Costco Wholesale have all seen significant revenue growth over the past decade as they successfully leverage their size to offer consumers lower prices, and expand into new markets.

Walmart and Costco's revenue have risen to $681 billion and $254 billion in 2024 from $408 billion and $78 billion in 2010, respectively.

One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy. Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.

In addition to fending off larger department stores, the national chain counted on by millions for essentials from toothpaste to prescriptions has also lost market share due to upstarts like Mark Cuban's CostPlus Drug Company, a low cost mail order pharmacy, and Hims, a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based telehealth platform.

Rite Aid enters, exits bankruptcy but woes remain

Rite Aid spent a lot of money acquiring rival pharmacies, including Brooks, in a bid to keep pace with Walgreens and CVS Health. The spending accelerated its retail footprint, but also saddled it with a mountain of debt that needed to be refinanced at higher rates when it came due.

The weight of its debt was already taking a toll before Covid struck. It attempted to sell itself to Walgreens in 2015, but the deal was revised after the U.S. government objected for antitrust concerns. Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018. A deal to sell itself to Albertsons was also scuttled in 2018.

Rite Aid continued to try to find a buyer but by 2022, when the Fed hiked interest rates, making debt refinancing more costly, it was in dire straights.

The final blow came in March 2023. The Department of Justice filed a civil suit against Rite Aid alleging pharmacists “repeatedly filled prescriptions for controlled substances with obvious red flags"" and that Rite Aid ""intentionally deleted internal notes about suspicious prescribers.”

Similar suits had previously been settled by Walgreens and CVS Health for $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, figures that Rite Aid couldn't match.

As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023. While in bankruptcy, it cut deals with lenders, closed over 500 stores, roughly a quarter of its locations, and settled the Justice Department's suit for $7.5 million and an unsubordinated, general unsecured claim of $401.8 million.

The company exited bankruptcy in September 2024, saying at the time it ""has successfully completed its financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11, marking a new beginning as a stronger company with a rightsized store footprint, more efficient operating model, significantly less debt, and additional financial resources.”

Unfortunately, the restructuring may not have been enough to guarantee Rite Aid's success, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The WSJ said on April 4 that Rite Aid's management is seeking buyers again and contemplating another bankruptcy filing. Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.

There's no telling what might happen to Rite Aid's remaining 1,300 stores if it sells itself or enters bankruptcy protection again. It's certainly possible more stores will close, leaving additional customers in the lurch, searching for a new pharmacy.

One potential option may be to follow in Walgreens footsteps. In March, the nation's second largest retail pharmacy chain agreed to sell itself to private equity player Sycamore Partners in a deal worth about $10 billion.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNDE2MDQzMzk2MjEyMTc1/gettyimages-1130947807.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 22:59:13.344686

(GADC), or McDonald’s Philippines, plans to invest at least ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion this year to open more than 65 stores, with the aim of reaching 1,000 stores in two years.

This comes as GADC Founder and Chairman George T. Yang said they will embark on an accelerated growth path for the quick-service restaurant (QSR) giant after McDonald’s Corp. of the United States (US) granted Yang and his son, GADC President and CEO Kenneth S. Yang, a fresh 20-year franchise for the Philippines.

“This 2025, We will be opening our 800th store,” said the younger Yang. McDonald’s opened 65 stores last year and ended 2024 with a network of 792 stores nationwide.

In a media interview, GADC’s CEO said, “We will continue to build new restaurants all over the Philippines. We grow through our company-owned stores as well as through our franchise restaurants.”

“For this year, most likely, we should grow about the same as what we did last year, which is 65 stores. Hopefully we will surpass it,” said Yang.

Since 65 new stores in a year was an all-time high for the company, he said, “This 2025, we aim to break our record new store openings.”

While expansion will be nationwide, Yang said most of the new stores will be outside the National Capital Region (NCR)—in cities in southern and northern Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

“We see our growth coming from areas outside of NCR that have rapidly been developing. We’re excited to open more stores and bring McDonald’s closer to more Filipinos,” Yang said.

He noted that, “The country is growing and there is progress in these areas so that is where we will be going.”

He said that they will likely maintain the current ratio of 55 percent company-owned stores and 45 percent franchise outlets.

Yang said they spent around ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion for the renovation of older restaurants and construction of new ones, and capital expenditures (capex) this year should at least be equal or higher.

In 2005, McDonald’s Philippines became a 100-percent Filipino-owned company with George and Kenneth Yang as its majority owners and tycoon Andrew Tan’s Alliance Global Group Inc. as its investment partner.

This strategic move paved the way for the company to look towards a digitally led future, underpinned by growing demand for seamless omni-channel customer experience.

The company extended its reach by growing its delivery business through digital initiatives. It was the first QSR to have an online delivery channel in 2009 and the first to launch a delivery app in 2014.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

That being said, you can find a dozen eggs for under $5 in most grocery stores. If you join a warehouse club like Costco or Sam’s Club, you might even be able to get a better deal.

It’s easy to understand why people do not like seeing the price of everyday staples go up. In reality, however, most families probably eat no more than a couple of dozen eggs a week.

If they eat the full two dozen, let’s say that their expenses increase by basically five dollars per week. That’s $260 a year.

Admittedly, eggs are not the only staple that has increased in price, which is causing many Americans to feel the pinch of inflation and higher prices.

Spending more at the grocery store each week is death by 1,000 paper cuts, which is a painful way to die.

But if you suffer one giant cut, the reality is you’re just as dead. Americans have some options to buy food produced in this country that won’t be impacted by tariffs.

Certain staples like coffee, well, almost certainly increase, but even there, there are options, at least if all you want is a caffeine fix. When it comes to electronics, there are no options.

You can’t get an iPhone, a laptop, a television, or most appliances that come from US manufacturers. And admittedly, unlike eggs, you can put off upgrading your phone or buying a new television.

At some point, however, whether it’s your washing machine, your refrigerator, your smart phone, or whatever type of computer you might use, something will break. When that happens, you are going to face a reality that’s going to be very painful.

That’s something Best Buy’s CEO is warning consumers and investors about.

Best Buy buys from China and Mexico

Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Sue Barry did not pull any punches when it came to discussing tariffs during the electronics retailer's fourth-quarter earnings call.

""Against this backdrop, I need to pause a moment to address the topic of tariffs. International trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex. China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively,"" she shared.

The CEO also made it clear that tariffs would be passed on to the retailer, which would then have to pass them onto consumers.

""While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,"" she shared.

Barry admitted that she does not have all the answers.

""This is because it is a highly dynamic situation, with uncertainty about the duration, timing, amount, and countries involved, in addition to the potential action of others in the industry, as well as the potential reaction of American consumers,"" she said.

Best Buy, American consumers face higher prices

Best Buy does have flexibility on some products and Barry wanted to make it clear that it will be actively looking to offset the increased costs as much as possible.

""I want to stress that our deeply tenured and talented teams are experienced at operating in volatile conditions, and this is also a situation where our partnerships with vendors are extremely valuable. We intend to execute the strategic plan we set for this year while navigating the tariff environment,"" she added.

CFO Matthew Bilunas made it clear, or at least as clear as someone speaking in financial terms could, that consumers will pay more.

""We're assuming in this estimation that a material portion of the costs are passed on to us by the vendors and then either, that's either directly broken out or blended in with the higher COGS (cost of goods sold) or through some level of promotional positioning. Of course, you know, we prefer not to raise prices. But because of the higher COGS, we need to enact some price increases, and that is going to vary based on product category, SKUs, competitive environment, and other factors,"" he shared.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgxMzEzMDc1NDYxMjM1ODE1/best-buy.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:43.530339

The president himself is determined to impose higher prices on his citizens, even though many Americans have now realized the truth of tariffs and that we will all be responsible for paying for them. Even though equities in the tech, automotive, and other sectors have declined, the former reality TV star’s most recent announcement was concerning from a fashion perspective.

Trump’s tariffs are having a much bigger impact than expected on Nike

Trump’s most recent list includes nations that produce clothing, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which are presumably further down the alphabet than Denmark, the European Union, and Greenland. Besides Nike, huge companies like Adidas and Puma source their supplies from the two nations listed, and Trump’s decision has caused their stock market value to plummet like a driverless Tesla into the Hudson River. Following the announcement of the news, shares of Skechers, Deckers, and Crocs also declined.

On Wednesday, the United States levied reciprocal tariffs of 46% on Vietnamese goods, 49% on Cambodian goods, 34% on Chinese goods, 32% on Indonesian goods, and 36% on Thai goods. Although Nike’s stock is still steady for the time being, analysts believe that the American brand will decline soon because it also depends significantly on imports from the aforementioned countries. Nike itself anticipates a more than 10% decline in revenue in the upcoming quarter, according to CNBC, and their figures are significantly worse than those of analysts.

Finance director Matt Friend anticipates that Nike’s initiatives will have the most impact in the fourth quarter, with revenue and gross margin headwinds projected to moderate. The corporation is also dealing with external challenges such as geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, variable foreign exchange rates, and tax rules, all of which may influence consumer confidence.

Besides Nike, American Eagle, and Wayfair could also be impacted due to Trump’s tariffs

Brands and retailers have shifted some or all of their production out of China and are now using Vietnam to manufacture everything from couches to sneakers. For many years, businesses wishing to stay out of the crossfire of U.S. trade conflicts with Beijing turned to China’s southern neighbor. They are now unable to avoid President Donald Trump as he broadens his trade war globally. As part of a new round of international tariffs announced Wednesday, Trump declared he would impose a 46% levy on Vietnamese products.

Major companies in the clothing, furniture, and toy industries may soon see cost rises as a result, and some of them may boost prices for customers. On April 9, the Vietnam tariffs go into force. Donald Trump announced a new round of international tariffs on Wednesday, including a 46% duty on Vietnamese imports. This may soon result in cost rises for large companies in the toy, furniture, and clothing industries, some of which may raise prices for customers. On April 9, the tariffs on Vietnam go into force.

Moreover, Mexico overtook China as the largest supplier of commodities to the United States in 2023, after China had been the leading exporter for more than 20 years. Government statistics from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show that, with $438.9 billion in products sold in 2024, China is now the second-largest supplier to the United States. Vietnam has also grown in popularity as a destination for businesses seeking to diversify their manufacturing sources and lower the risks associated with trade disputes with China.",https://pedirayudas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nike.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:47.825213

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands.","Starbucks is one of the most well-known and beloved coffee chains in the United States. With thousands of stores across the country, the company has kept enormous popularity over the years. Its success lies in a varied offering of beverages and a service that aims to be quick and efficient.

However, behind every cup they sell, there are small details that often go unnoticed. An example of this is, for instance, the measurement marks that allow baristas to prepare drinks with precision.

This Is the Change That Starbucks Has Already Implemented in the United States

For years, Starbucks cups included black marks on their sides. These lines were not just decorative, as some might think. Their function was very practical: they allowed employees to measure the ingredients of each drink accurately.

Each line on the tall, grande, and venti cups marked a precise amount of liquid. This facilitated the quick and efficient preparation of popular drinks like the iced chai tea latte. Thus, Starbucks baristas didn't need external measuring tools, which optimized the service.

However, recently, Starbucks made an important change: it modified the marks to a more visible design. The new cups feature white and black lines, which improve visibility in both light and dark beverages. Additionally, these cups include raised dots to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

This change wasn't the only one. Starbucks implemented opaque paper cups in 14 states in the United States, removing the measurement marks. The company also opted for compostable cups and lids made of the same material, reducing its use of plastic.

The transition has caused divided opinions among customers. While some applaud Starbucks's effort to promote a more sustainable change, others lament the loss of the transparent cups. Customers can no longer see their drink—and what's left of it in the cup—as they did before.

Despite the criticism it has received, Starbucks continues to bet firmly on innovation and continuous improvement. The company keeps seeking a balance between functionality and sustainability. So, although some customers may take time to adapt to the new designs, it is likely that over time they will get used to the modifications.

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands. The brand continues to stand out for its ability to adapt and stay at the forefront, establishing itself as a leader in innovation within the sector.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-starbucks-con-bandera-estados-unidos-al-lado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-06 09:01:53.922466

Too Rich for the Middle Class?
There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze.
India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing.
Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out.","Starbucks (SBUX) came to India more than a decade ago with big dreams. Now, those dreams are hitting a patch of reality. According to a report in the Financial Times, the coffee giant has sharply slowed its store expansion in the country, opening just 16 new outlets in the last quarter of 2024 – barely half of what it had aimed for. That’s a far cry from the 1,000-store target by 2028, which was announced in early 2023, which now looks more like a stretch goal than a clear path.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

What Is the Price Target for SBUX Stock?

Turning Wall Street, Starbucks is considered a Moderate Buy based on 24 ratings. The average price target for SBUX stock is $111.64, implying a 35.98% upside potential.

In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook.
Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India.
The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise.","Starbucks has sharply slowed the pace of its store expansion in India amid intensifying competition in the country’s evolving café culture and signs of consumer fatigue, The Financial Times has reported.

The US coffee giant, which entered India in 2012 through a joint venture with Tata Consumer Products, had last year announced plans to nearly triple its store count to 1,000 outlets by 2028. But that target is now facing headwinds, as middle-class consumers pull back on discretionary spending and rivals flood the market with newer and more affordable café options.

In an interview with The Financial Times, Sunil D’Souza, Chief Executive of Tata Consumer Products, said Starbucks opened only ""a little over half"" the 30 stores it had targeted for the December quarter. “We saw traffic dropping,” D’Souza said. “So I told my team, let’s moderate a bit. We’ll continue to grow and we’re still opening outlets, but we’ve slowed it down momentarily.”

Starbucks opened a net 16 stores in the three months through December, bringing the total to 473 across 74 Indian cities — well below the post-pandemic record of 29 store additions in the January-March quarter last year.

India, though traditionally a tea-drinking nation, has seen a boom in speciality cafés in recent years, led by homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave Coffee, alongside global entrants such as Tim Hortons, Pret A Manger, and Costa Coffee. The report said this surge in new-age coffee brands, coupled with changing urban preferences, is reshaping how Indians consume beverages outside the home.

In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook. The report said the coffee chain introduced smaller ""Picco"" cup sizes, a milky short masala chai priced at Rs320, and food items like chilli paneer sandwiches — part of its effort to blend international appeal with Indian flavours.

To make its cafés more inviting in smaller cities, the company also moved away from darker, high-end interiors to lighter colours that signal affordability and accessibility.

D’Souza said in the interview that in non-metro markets, many consumers still view the brand as premium. “Often we’ve heard that people are not entering because they see this as... a luxury,” he said.

Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India. “There’s a long runway — it’s just that in a country like India, you’ve got to have a slightly longer perspective,” D’Souza said. He added that the 1,000-store goal still stands, though the timeline “might go up or down by a year.”

During its third quarter investor call, the company said affordability-focused efforts are gaining traction, even as demand pressures persist. The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise. Expansion picked up in East India, with new stores in Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bilaspur, and Gangtok.

To improve local relevance, the company introduced a “classic menu” tailored to Indian taste preferences. Initial trials showed promising repeat purchases, the company noted. It also launched a Diwali 360-campaign with a media reach of over 40 million, and introduced Monsoon Malabar — a reserve small-lot coffee developed exclusively for the Indian market.

Globally too, Starbucks has hit a rough patch. The report noted the company has seen four straight quarters of declining same-store sales, weighed down by slowing footfall in both the US and China — its two largest markets. In China, it has been undercut by faster-growing rivals like Luckin Coffee.",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-04-06%2Fzz6jbkqa%2Fhiroko-nishimura-SiSLeFTr5Cg-unsplash.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-04-06 06:01:14.403466

D’Souza mentioned that the decrease in customer traffic prompted the decision to decelerate the expansion.

Summary of the day so far

Here is a summary of the latest developments so far:

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. “We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.

The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US in April as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.

Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”. A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.

Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”. He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”

The Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation. Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”. MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

Some 1,200 demonstrations are planned across the U.S. on Saturday in what organizers expect to be the largest single day of protest against president Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.

Thousands were streaming into downtown Washington as the protests got underway. Organisers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally at the National Mall.

The protests in the U.S. will give Trump opponents an opportunity to demonstrate their displeasure en masse in response to Trump’s raft of executive orders.

Some 150 activist groups have signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests are planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.

Protesters were lining the busy thoroughfare of Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C., awaiting buses to take them downtown. They were carrying signs with slogans such as “No Kings in the USA” and “Deport Musk.”

Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among hundreds who gathered early in front of the stage below the Washington Monument.

She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”

David Madden, a 75-year old Army veteran and retired trial lawyer, said he flew from Dayton, Ohio, to demonstrate against “the injustice that is dominating this country, the institutions that are being stolen from the American people, the confusion in the courts, the fact that we have a population that I believe is essentially racist.”

Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are roiling global financial markets, with stocks tumbling across the board from New York to London.

Wall Street suffered its worst week since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago as investors worldwide balked at the US president’s risky bid to overhaul the global economy with the vast tariffs.

Experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of Wednesday’s extraordinary Rose Garden press conference will be negative – but just how bad remains highly uncertain.

Here are the key stories at a glance:

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April.

A JLR spokesperson said: “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.”

JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, is one of Britain’s biggest producers, selling 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually.

Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales and JLR is at the centre of Britain’s car industry, accounting for £1 in every £8 of the country’s exports.

The Sunday Times reported that JLR is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs. Shipping vehicles across the Atlantic takes about 21 days.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in central London as part of global demonstrations against Donald Trump’s administration.

Crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square on Saturday afternoon with banners which read “No to Maga hate” and “Dump Trump”.

The rally is one of hundreds of so-called “hands off” demonstrations around the world – including in cities across the US, Paris and Berlin.

The movement has been organised by more than 150 groups, including civil rights groups and trade unions.

A 25% levy on all foreign cars imported into America came into force on Thursday, and a wider “baseline” 10% tariff on goods imported from around the world kicked in on Saturday morning.

Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed their “concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia” in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Starmer’s office said.

The UK’s prime minister spoke to the French president on Saturday, the latest in a series of calls with world leaders following the announcement of the US levies.

Issuing a readout of the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister spoke with President Macron following this week’s announcement that the US will impose additional tariffs. They agreed that a trade war was in nobody’s interests but nothing should be off the table and that it was important to keep business updated on developments.

“The prime minister and president also shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia.

“Following discussions between military planners in Ukraine this week, they discussed the good progress that has been made on the Coalition of the Willing.

“The prime minister and president agreed to stay in close contact over the coming weeks.”

Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation. Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”. MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Donald Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signaled little concern about the ongoing nosedive, reports Reuters.

“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

“If I were to analyse in my old hat, and this is the only time I’m going to talk about it … what’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a Maga problem,” Bessent, who ran a hedge fund until being tapped as treasury secretary by Trump, said.

“Mag 7” refers to the shares of the “Magnificent 7” – a group of seven high-performing tech stocks that had helped drive the market higher before its recent selloff. Maga refers to Trump’s “Make America great again” political slogan.

US stocks have tumbled by about 10% in the two days after Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than analysts and investors had been anticipating.

It is a drop that market analysts and large investors themselves have laid at the feet of Trump’s aggressive push on tariffs, which most economists and the head of the Federal Reserve believe risk stoking inflation and damaging economic growth, reports Reuters.

Stocks did take a hit in late January when Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant that it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent services. It resulted in a record one-day loss of nearly $600bn in value from the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, one of the “Magnificent 7”. But the market soon found its footing again and by mid-February, the benchmark S&P 500 index had regained a record-high level.

Then stocks turned south again starting in late February after a widely followed survey of consumers showed households growing broadly pessimistic about the economy’s prospects and fearful that Trump’s push for tariffs would drive up inflation, reports Reuters.

A raft of other surveys of businesses and consumers since then have flagged similar concerns, and other data has shown the pace of activity has slowed over the course of the first quarter of 2025. The S&P has lost nearly 14% since 19 February, and nearly $10tn of US stock market value has been erased.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has been dismissive of the drop as well.

Trump himself on Friday retweeted a social media post bearing the caption “Trump is Purposely CRASHING The Market” and featuring images of the president pointing at a large downward red arrow and of him signing executive orders at the White House.

Meanwhile, Bessent also told Carlson the administration retains a “strong dollar” policy and dismissed assertions by some analysts that the tariff drive was a deliberate effort to weaken the dollar to make US goods more competitive on global markets.

“No one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the US dollar other than President Trump or myself,” Bessent said. “We are the only ones that speak for this administration, the United States government on dollar policy.”

“We have a strong-dollar policy and we are putting in all of the necessary ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run,” he said.

The dollar has shed nearly 6% of its value against major trading partners’ currencies since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, reports Reuters.

'Hang tough, it won’t be easy': Trump defiant on tariffs

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity.

The comments came as the US president’s widest-ranging tariffs took effect in a move that could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.

“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.

“This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

A 10% “baseline” tariff came into place just after midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country’s trade deficits.

The trade gaps, said the White House, were driven by an “absence of reciprocity” in relationships and other policies like “exorbitant value-added taxes”.

Come 9 April, about 60 trading partners – including the European Union, Japan and China – are to face even higher rates tailored to each economy.

Already, Trump’s sharp 34%tariff on Chinese goods, to kick in next week, triggered Beijing’s announcement of its own 34% tariff on US products from 10 April.

Beijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict the export of rare-earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.

“China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,” Trump said in his post. “They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly.”

But other major trading partners held back as they digested the unfolding international standoff amid fears of a recession.

Leading garment producer Bangladesh holds crisis talks on US tariffs

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Textile and garment production accounts for about 80% of exports in Bangladesh, and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hard hit in a revolution that toppled the government last year.

Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

Bangladesh exports $8.4bn of garments annually to the US, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national trade body. That totals about 20% of Bangladesh’s total ready-made garments exports, reports afp.

“Chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has convened an emergency meeting … to discuss the US tariff issue,” a government statement read, with the meeting to take place late Saturday in the capital, Dhaka. Top experts, advisers and officials will attend, it added.

Bangladesh’s tax authority, the National Board of Revenue, is also expected to meet to review the fallout from the tariffs.

Rakibul Alam Chowdhury, chair of RDM Group, a major manufacturer with an estimated $25m turnover, said on Thursday that the industry would lose trade. “Buyers will go to other cost-competitive markets – this is going to be a massive blow for our industry,” he said.

Several garment factories produce clothing for the US market alone, report AFP. Anwar Hossain, administrator of the BGMEA, has told AFP that the industry was “not ready” for the tariff impact.

Bangladesh, the second-largest producer after China, manufactures garments for global brands – including for US firms such as Gap Inc, Tommy Hilfiger and Levi Strauss.

Jaguar Land Rover to pause shipments to the US as it works to 'address new trading terms'

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs, reports the PA news agency.

In a statement on Saturday, a JLR spokesperson said:

The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands.

As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.”

Earlier on Saturday, the Times had reported that JLR would pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month (see 11.48am BST).

Anti-Trump protests expected in US today

Kira Lerner

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.

MoveOn, one of the organizations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labor, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

“This is shaping up to be the biggest single-day protest in the last several years of American history,” Ezra Levin, a founder of Indivisible, one of the groups planning the event, said on a recent organizing call.

The largest event is expected to be on the National Mall in Washington DC, where members of Congress, including the Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, are scheduled to speak to crowds.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most U.S. trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the U.S. duty-free.

This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34% on all U.S. goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan told public broadcaster RTHK, however, Hong Kong would not impose separate countermeasures, citing the need for the city to remain “free and open”.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said:

The market has spoken.

Now is the time for the U.S. to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, says he is prepared to dance if it means sidestepping some of the worst of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Last week he sent a letter to India’s president, Droupadi Murmu, urging her to join him in a tango to celebrate 75 years of ­bilateral trade.

Xi said it was “the right choice” for the two countries to be “partners of mutual achievement and realise the ‘Dragon-Elephant Tango’”, which, he added, “fully serves the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples.”

Beijing is on a wide-ranging charm offensive, aimed at redirecting its exports away from the US to other willing destinations as Washington erects trade barriers.

Tariffs on China imposed by the US president amounting to 20% earlier this year were more than doubled last week to 54% and an effective average rate of 65%, raising the cost of Chinese imports to a level that many analysts believe will be uncompetitive.

The response from Beijing was swift. A sell-off on financial markets intensified after China’s finance ministry said it would respond in kind, adding 34% to the tariff on all US goods from 10 April.

Investors worry that a recession in the US cannot be ruled out as the trade war intensifies and companies hunker down, cutting investment and jobs to weather the storm.

John Denton, head of the International Chambers of Commerce, likens the onset of these tariff wars to the oil shock of the 1970s, such is its seismic importance. “The overriding theme is the battle for supremacy between China and the US for global trade dominance,” he said.

Jaguar Land Rover will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of president Donald Trump’s 25% tariff, according to a report in the Times newspaper.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters on Saturday.

A pause in shipments would add to fears over the impact from tariffs on the UK’s car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly. The US is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20% share, data from industry body SMMT shows, reports Reuters.

Jaguar Land Rover, one of the UK’s biggest producers by volume, sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually. Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales.

The US 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April. The previous day, Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe, upending world trade.

The Times said that Jaguar Land Rover is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs.

Taiwan president Lai Ching-te met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests, reports Reuters.

President Donald Trump announced across-the-board import tariffs on Wednesday with much higher duties for dozens of trading partners, including Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the US and is facing a 32% duty on its products. The US tariffs, however, do not apply to semiconductors, a major Taiwanese export.

Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

Lai “hopes to give industry the greatest support, stabilise the economic situation, ensure Taiwan’s industry’s global competitiveness, and safeguard our country’s national interests and the continued steady progress of our economy”, Kuo said.

Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an important supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment on whether it attended the meeting. TSMC is in its quiet period ahead of first quarter earnings announcement on 17 April.

On Friday, Taiwan’s government announced T$88bn ($2.67bn/£2.07bn) in financial help for companies and industries to deal with the impact of the US tariffs.

Taiwan, which says the tariffs are unreasonable, has said it will discuss them with the US and has not announced any retaliatory tariffs.

US president Donald Trump has long been an advocate of tariffs – once describing them as the most beautiful word in the dictionary – and his promise to impose them was a central plank of his presidential election campaign. In anticipation, Downing Street developed a defensive strategy that revolved around building a strong relationship with Trump’s White House – despite clear political differences – and launching talks to strike an economic deal that would secure tariff exemptions.

Trade talks between the UK and US began soon after Trump’s inauguration, before the prime minister visited Washington in February, with the goal of agreeing a relatively narrow deal focused on advanced technologies. Talks intensified before UK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’ own visit to meet Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, just over two weeks ago.

UK officials were assured by their US counterparts that they were in a strong position to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. “By then we knew what the faultlines were, and we were broadly there, so we just had some details to thrash out,” an official said.

The two key figures leading the negotiations are Reynolds and Varun Chandra, a corporate strategist turned senior No 10 aide known as the prime minister’s “business whisperer”. Officials have been impressed by how Chandra has navigated the US administration. “He just gets them, and they get him. The talks have been much more corporate in tone than trade negotiations usually are. That’s his world,” one said.

A senior trade department official, Kate Joseph, and Keir Starmer’s economic international affairs adviser, Michael Ellam, have been working behind the scenes at home to get the Whitehall machine ready. Multiple scenarios were drawn up depending on what tariff regime Trump imposed.

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.97%.

For the most recent quarter, U.S. Bancorp was expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, but it reported $1.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.94%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1 per share, while it actually produced $1.03 per share, a surprise of 3%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For U.S. Bancorp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

U.S. Bancorp has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 16, 2025.

With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Mad Money Twitter - Jim Cramer Twitter - Facebook - Instagram Questions, comments, suggestions for the ""Mad Money"" website?","CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide insight into company expectations for dealing with President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Big banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley all report results on Friday, April 11.

The consumer price index report on Thursday will give the latest numbers on inflation.

After President Donald Trump's new tariffs crushed global stocks for a second consecutive day, CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout.

Big bank earnings headline the upcoming week, alongside inflation data. No matter what the numbers reveal, though, Cramer said the direction of the market will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.

""If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,"" Cramer said.

Retailer Levi Strauss reports earnings on Monday. Cramer said the jeans manufacturer is vulnerable to the impact of tariffs on countries like Japan and Mexico, and previous poor guidance punished the stock. Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.

Tuesday brings earnings from drugstore chain Walgreens and Cal-Maine Foods. Walgreens announced in March that it would go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Meanwhile egg producer Cal-Maine could provide some insight on egg prices after they spiked in the winter, Cramer said.

Delta Air Lines announces its quarterly results on Wednesday, and although the airline cut its outlook in March, Cramer said the carrier's earnings will still provide insight into the health of the travel industry. Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands also reports Wednesday. Tariffs on Mexico could present further headwinds for the company, Cramer said.

Money Report

On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results. While tariffs on new cars could boost sales for CarMax, Cramer said a potential recession would ultimately limit the stock's appeal.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the latest consumer price index report on Thursday. Inflation has become sticky, Cramer said, and Trump's tariffs will further raise prices. That will put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it decides whether to cut interest rates in May, he said.

Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results. Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.

""Our only real hope is that the president comes up with something that can turn this bear into a bull,"" Cramer said.

Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.","After President Donald Trump's new tariffs crushed global stocks for a second consecutive day, CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout.

Big bank earnings headline the upcoming week, alongside inflation data. No matter what the numbers reveal, though, Cramer said the direction of the market will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.

""If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,"" Cramer said.

Retailer Levi Strauss reports earnings on Monday. Cramer said the jeans manufacturer is vulnerable to the impact of tariffs on countries like Japan and Mexico, and previous poor guidance punished the stock. Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.

Tuesday brings earnings from drugstore chain Walgreens and Cal-Maine Foods . Walgreens announced in March that it would go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Meanwhile egg producer Cal-Maine could provide some insight on egg prices after they spiked in the winter, Cramer said.

Delta Air Lines announces its quarterly results on Wednesday, and although the airline cut its outlook in March, Cramer said the carrier's earnings will still provide insight into the health of the travel industry. Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands also reports Wednesday. Tariffs on Mexico could present further headwinds for the company, Cramer said.

On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results. While tariffs on new cars could boost sales for CarMax, Cramer said a potential recession would ultimately limit the stock's appeal.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the latest consumer price index report on Thursday. Inflation has become sticky, Cramer said, and Trump's tariffs will further raise prices. That will put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it decides whether to cut interest rates in May, he said.

Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results. Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.

""Our only real hope is that the president comes up with something that can turn this bear into a bull,"" Cramer said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107113454-NUP_198430_00638r.jpg?v=1695164732&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-04-04 20:04:47.605041

The Annual Meeting will be held solely by means of remote communication to allow our stockholders to participate regardless of their geographic location. This Notice of 2025 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement is being mailed or transmitted beginning on or about April 4, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2025.

Our strategic priorities are accelerating our journey to becoming America's leading and most trusted health care company.

Our priorities

Best-in-class businesses

Strong integrated capabilities

Leading digital strategy and tech-enabled simplicity and efficiency

Disciplined capital stewardship

Message from Our Executive Chair, Our Chief Executive Officer and Our Lead Independent Director

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

Our aspiration is to be the leading and most trusted health care company in America. We believe this is possible because of the businesses we have, the strategy we are executing, and most importantly, our colleagues who serve 185 million people across our country.

Our integrated model allows us to deliver greater access, simpler experiences, lower costs and better outcomes. In short, we are uniquely positioned to provide the things people want the most from health care.

Financial performance

We are confident that the changes made in 2024 have set CVS Health® on a strong path for the future. We took decisive actions to improve the long-term sustainability of our Aetna® business, continued to implement our innovative and transparent pharmacy models, increased our focus on operational excellence and enhanced our leadership team. In 2024, we delivered $372.8 billion in revenue, generated $9.1 billion in operating cash flow and returned nearly $3.4 billion to stockholders.

Maximizing value

Our ongoing commitment to driving innovation and integrating our businesses creates value for patients, members, customers and stockholders. In 2024, we made significant progress with our industry-first pharmacy models, CVS CostVantage™ and CVS Caremark TrueCost™. In addition, Cordavis™ contributed to net client savings of almost $1 billion by redefining the biosimilar drug marketplace. Our integrated teams helped Aetna achieve exceptional Star Ratings, with 88% of our Medicare Advantage members in 4-Star plans or higher.

Technology at the foundation

Technology helps create exceptional experiences for our consumers while simplifying how our colleagues work. We redesigned our CVS Health app in January 2025 to seamlessly connect users to our services and to the care they need - all in one place. Our clinicians can use artificial intelligence to summarize case notes, which frees up their time to engage with patients more deeply. Through the strategic and responsible use of technology, we are streamlining and connecting experiences for the millions of people we serve.

Management updates

Our management team and Board of Directors work together on the advancement of the Company's strategic plan. We proactively engage with stockholders to enhance our understanding and to be responsive to your perspectives and preferences.

We made key leadership team updates in 2024 to drive focused execution of our strategy, including David's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") and Roger's appointment as Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, Prem Shah was appointed Group President, CVS Health. In this newly created role, Prem is responsible for operational performance and integrated value creation across our CVS Caremark®, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Health Care Delivery businesses. Steve Nelson also joined the leadership team as the newly appointed President of Aetna, bringing deep expertise leading managed care and health care delivery companies. Steve is working closely with David to build on and accelerate the plan to improve performance at Aetna. In addition, Heidi Capozzi was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer leading the human resources, labor relations, compensation and benefits and corporate social responsibility teams.

i

Board changes

We made a number of changes to our Board, including naming Mike Mahoney as Lead Independent Director to help provide dynamic Board leadership while maintaining strong independent oversight. We also enhanced our highly qualified Board with the appointment of four new directors, Leslie Norwalk, Larry Robbins, Guy Sansone and Doug Shulman, further sharpening our ability to achieve our bold ambitions. They bring skills that complement those of other Board members, including significant proficiency in health care, health services and other regulated industries, as well as areas corresponding to the evolution of our business.

We'd like to express our gratitude to J.P. Millon, who is retiring in May after having served on our Board since March 2007. J.P.'s extensive background in the pharmacy benefit management, pharmaceutical and life sciences businesses has been instrumental in the growth of the Company, and we wish him well in his future endeavors. We also acknowledge the many contributions of Nancy-Ann DeParle and Mary Schapiro, who have provided over eleven years and eight years, respectively, of diligent service to the Board and are not standing for re-election this year. Nancy-Ann has chaired our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for the past five years as our Board and management team has been updated, and her experience as the ""health care czar"" under President Obama has made her an invaluable member of the Health Services and Technology Committee since it was formed in 2016. Mary's background as the former Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA"") has made her a vital contributor to our Audit Committee, as well as our Investment and Finance Committee during its separate existence in the key years following the Aetna merger. We thank both Nancy-Ann and Mary and wish them the best in the future.

Annual Meeting of Stockholders

We will host our Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually at 8:00 a.m. ET on May 15, 2025 to allow our stockholders to participate regardless of location. As a stockholder, your vote is important to us and we encourage you to vote at your earliest convenience.

In 2025, we are building momentum across our businesses to drive our strategy forward and meet our financial commitments. Thank you for your investment in CVS Health. Your support is critical as we work to deliver simply better health for all Americans.

Sincerely,

Roger N. Farah

GES reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While net sales increased, earnings decreased from the year-ago period. Sales growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of rag & bone (concluded in April 2024), alongside modest gains in GES’ core operations.

The company is optimistic about growth opportunities across its core Guess brand, the newly launched Guess Jeans line and the acquisition of rag & bone. GES plans to improve overall profitability by sharpening its global direct-to-consumer strategy and streamlining business portfolio. These strategic moves are expected to contribute to a $30 million boost in operating profit by fiscal 2027.

GES’ Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

GES posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.48 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41. However, the bottom line declined 26.4% from $2.01 reported in the prior-year period.

Guess?, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Guess?, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Guess?, Inc. Quote

Net revenues were $932.3 million, rising 4.6% year over year and surpassing the consensus mark of $899 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, net revenues rose 9%. The strong performance was driven by the rag & bone acquisition and positive momentum in the wholesale businesses across Europe and the Americas, and higher licensing revenues. All operating segments contributed to revenue growth, with the exception of the Asia segment, which saw a decline.

Gross margin contracted to 44.1% from 45.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased to 32.8% from 29.1% in the prior-year quarter.

Adjusted earnings from operations were $106.5 million, down 18.2% from $130.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, down from 14.6% reported in the same quarter last year. This downtick was mainly caused by increased expenses, higher advertising and store-related costs, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses. These pressures were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation.

Decoding GES’ Segmental Performance

Revenues in the Americas Retail segment rose 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% at cc. However, retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, declined 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% at cc. The operating margin in the segment was 8.9%, down 6.1% year over year. This decline was caused by the adverse effects of negative comparable sales, higher expenses and increased markdowns.

Americas Wholesale revenues soared 63% on a reported basis and 69% at cc. The segment’s operating margin fell to 12.8%, down 15.7% year over year due to the impact of newly acquired businesses and lower product margin.

The Europe segment’s revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 7% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) remained relatively flat on a reported basis and increased 5% at cc. The segmental operating margin was 15.4%, down 2.6% year over year, due to higher expenses and the impact of newly acquired businesses. This was partially offset by lower markdowns.

Asia revenues decreased 15% on a reported basis and 11% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) dropped 16% and 11% on a reported basis and at cc, respectively. The operating margin in the segment was 1.3%, down 3.5% year over year. This downside was primarily due to lower product margins and reduced revenues.

Licensing revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and at cc. Segmental operating margin was 94.8% compared with 92.7% in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by lower expenses.

GES’ Financial Health Snapshot & Shareholder-Friendly Moves

The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $187.7 million and long-term debt and finance lease obligations of nearly $150.7 million. Stockholders’ equity was around $505 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended Feb. 1, 2025, was $121.7 million. Free cash flow for the same period amounted to $29.8 million. For fiscal 2026, free cash flow is expected to be $55 million.

GES announced a quarterly dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on May 2, 2025, to its shareholders on record as of April 16.

The company repurchased about 2.6 million shares for $60.3 million during fiscal 2025.

What to Expect From GES in the Future?

For fiscal 2026, Guess? anticipates revenues to grow of 3.9-6.2%.

The adjusted operating margin is expected to be 4.5-5.4%. The GAAP operating margin is likely to be 4.3-5.2%.

Management expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32-$1.76 in fiscal 2026 compared with the $1.96 recorded in fiscal 2025. On a GAAP basis, EPS is envisioned in the range of $1.03-$1.37 compared with the 77 cents reported in fiscal 2025.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, management expects revenue growth of 5.8-7.5%. On an adjusted basis, Guess? expects to post a loss of 74-65 cents per share. On a GAAP basis, it expects to deliver a loss in the range of 75-66 cents per share.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 29.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 30.5% decline.

The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).
“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%.
Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%.
The world’s largest shipping company at the time of writing is MSC, a privately held Swiss company that does not publish its accounts.","New figures released from climate change NGO Opportunity Green claim profits on an “extraordinary scale” have been made by leading shipping companies in the years since the pandemic.

The world’s 139 largest shipping companies – accounting for 90% of the world’s fleet – made almost US$340.0Bn in profits from 2019-2023, the last year for which full figures are available. Of this sum, 93% was taken by the top 10 largest companies, the report says.

“The pandemic created an enormous windfall for shipping companies as the easing of lockdown restrictions caused a spike in global demand for freight, pushing prices up to record levels. But freight prices have soared again since 2023, as a result of disruptions to global shipping routes including drought restrictions on the Panama Canal and attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea. As freight prices have risen, so have shipping company profits,” the report said.

It added, “Yet despite these record earnings, shipping company taxes have remained catastrophically low and many of the world’s biggest shipping companies are failing to pay their fair share of taxes.”

It said the top 10 largest companies paid only US$30.0Bn in tax from 2019-2023, at a tax rate of around 10%. The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).

“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%. The report shows the problem is biggest in the largest and most profitable companies, with nine of the top 10 from high income developed economies and four of those headquartered in wealthy OECD member states. Over 2019-2023, members of the OECD have an average tax rate on shipping companies of around 4%, compared with a rest of the world average of 16%.”

A statement said, “The top three publicly listed European shipping companies, Maersk, CMA CGM and Hapag Lloyd, paid only $4.6Bn in taxes in total over five years, despite making nearly half of all profits globally (US$137.0Bn). Had the top 10 largest shipping companies paid the average rate of tax faced by other companies in their home countries, the additional tax raised would have been US$42.0Bn.”

Economics at Opportunity Green senior director James Meadway said, “This is a shameful set of statistics, and shipping companies must change course, start paying their fair share of taxes and get on board with the true impact their operations are having on the planet. The international shipping sector is a significant contributor to climate change, producing 1Bn tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions each year, but nowhere is this felt more acutely than in the Global South, where frontline countries are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%. If these four companies alone were taxed at the same rate as other big corporations where they are headquartered, more than US$38.0Bn extra in taxes would have been raised over those five years.”

Opportunity Green chief executive and founder Aoife O’Leary said, “These figures should act as a stark warning as member states from all over the globe gather at the International Maritime Organization to discuss the possibility of a levy on international shipping emissions. The shipping industry currently produces 1Bn tonnes of GHG emissions each year, and yet it continues to dodge paying fair taxes. It now has the unique chance to put that right by becoming the first industry to introduce a global levy and raise revenues that could be directed to deal with the worst of climate change in climate vulnerable countries.”

The top 10 largest shipping companies are Moller-Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, China COSCO, Ocean Network Express, Evergreen Marine Corp, Orient Overseas, Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp, Wan Hai Lines and SITC.

A statement said all 10 companies were contacted for their responses to the figures in the report. Of these, Wan Hai Lines, Maersk and Orient Overseas responded to confirm the figures provided about their company are accurate. No replies were received from the remaining top 10 companies.

Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.","In this article:

Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 11, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.5%.

Revenues are expected to be $4.74 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon?

For The Bank of New York Mellon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.49%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.72, delivering a surprise of +10.26%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The Bank of New York Mellon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

For fiscal 2025, analysts forecast ELV to post EPS of $34.17, reflecting a 3.4% increase from $33.04 in fiscal 2024. Looking ahead, EPS is projected to grow 14.2% year-over-year to $39.02 in fiscal 2026.

ELV has underperformed the broader markets over the past 52 weeks, with shares down 8.1%, compared to the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 1.9% gain and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLV) marginal dip over the same period.

Adjusted EPS fell 31.7% year-over-year, and the Health Benefits segment saw a 75% plunge in operating gain, with operating margin shrinking by 150 basis points. Medical membership declined 2% to 45.7 million, missing estimates, largely due to Medicaid disenrollment. Rising total expenses and a drop in net investment income added further strain to the bottom line.

Moreover, management projected weaker margins for both the Health Benefits and Carelon Services segments in fiscal 2025, tempering investor sentiment.

Analysts' consensus rating on ELV stock is bullish, with a ""Strong Buy"" rating overall. Out of 20 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 15 ""Strong Buys,” one ""Moderate Buy,"" and four ""Holds.” The average analyst price target for ELV is $491.37, suggesting a potential upside of 10.8% from current levels.

The options market points to an implied move of 5% up or down following the Q1 results.","Welcome to Michael Kramer’s pick of the top three market events to look out for in the week beginning Monday 7 April.

The big US banks kick off what is likely to be an interesting corporate earnings season in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs and the heightened sense of economic uncertainty. Trump’s ‘reciprocal’ levies announcement on Wednesday sent the S&P 500 4.8% lower on Thursday, its biggest one-day drop since Covid in 2020.

Also coming up are the March readings of the US consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and the producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Inflation could rise in the future if the tariff-induced increases in import costs are passed on to US consumers, though it may take time for the full impact of the tariffs to show up in the CPI and PPI data.

In the UK, meanwhile, February GDP data out on Friday could shed light on whether the Bank of England’s recent interest rate cuts are helping to boost growth. Policymakers cut rates in August 2024 (from 5.25% to 5%), in November (to 4.75%) and again in February 2025 (to the current rate of 4.5%).

US March CPI

Thursday 10 April

Analysts estimate that US CPI rose 2.5% in the year to March, easing from 2.8% in February. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have increased 3% year-on-year, down from 3.1% in February. On a monthly basis, headline CPI is thought to have increased 0.2%, with core CPI up 0.3%.

On Friday, PPI is expected to come in at 3%, down from 3.2% in February. Analysts use the CPI and PPI readings to estimate the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the next reading of which is due out later this month.

Trump’s tariffs have changed the outlook for US inflation, which may be set to rise if importers pass on higher costs to consumers. Should the March inflation figures come in higher than expected, the inflation outlook could deteriorate even further. Implementing the tariffs on top of hot inflation data might raise fears of stagflation – a combination of slowing growth and rising inflation. In that scenario, the US dollar might continue to weaken, potentially benefiting the Japanese yen. Having broken below support at ¥147 on Thursday, USD/JPY could be on its way towards the next key support area near ¥142.

UK February GDP

Friday 11 April

After the UK economy unexpectedly shrank 0.1% month-on-month in January, down from a 0.4% increase in December, economists estimate that gross domestic product grew 0.1% in February. With growth tepid, and given that the market turmoil brought on by Trump’s tariffs could run into a second week, the GDP report may not significantly affect the pound.

The pound looks slightly overextended, with GBP/USD having tested resistance near $1.32 on Thursday before slipping back to $1.297. That said, if the pound benefits from further dollar weakness, the pair could strengthen back above $1.30. If GBP/USD clears $1.31, then $1.342 may become the next upside target.

JPMorgan Chase Q1 earnings

Friday 11 April

BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are among the US financial heavyweights kicking off a fresh US earnings season on Friday, but JPMorgan will be the one to watch. Analysts expect the largest US bank by assets to report that first-quarter earnings grew 3.7% year-on-year to $4.60 a share. Revenue is forecast to have increased 3.4% to $43.98bn. Looking ahead to Q2, analysts forecast earnings of $4.57 a share on revenue of $44bn. The options market points to an implied move of 5% up or down following the Q1 results.

The JPMorgan share price closed at $228.69 on Thursday, down 18% from the February high, following a rocky few weeks. The chart below shows the emergence of a possible head-and-shoulders pattern. A break below support at $224 could confirm the pattern. If that support level breaks, the stock might slide to around $205.

Valued at a market cap of $385.1 billion, the company boasts a broad portfolio of drugs covering a wide range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular & metabolism, immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and infectious diseases and vaccines. It is expected to announce its fiscal Q1 earnings for 2025 before the market opens on Tuesday, Apr. 15.

Prior to this event, analysts project this healthcare giant to report a profit of $2.59 per share, down 4.4% from $2.71 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Its earnings of $2.04 per share in the previous quarter outpaced the consensus estimate by 2%.

For the full year, analysts expect JNJ to report EPS of $10.58, up 6% from $9.98 in fiscal 2024. Its EPS is expected to further grow 4.6% year over year to $11.07 in fiscal 2026.

JNJ has aligned with the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 3.6% gains over the past 52 weeks, although it has outpaced the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLV) marginal decline over the same time frame.

On Apr. 1, JNJ’s shares closed down 7.6% after a Texas bankruptcy judge dismissed the company's latest attempt to settle thousands of lawsuits. The lawsuits allege that J&J's baby powder and other talc-based products caused ovarian cancer. The court ruling was a major setback for the company, contributing to the sharp decline in its stock price.

On Jan. 22, JNJ released its Q4 results. It delivered adjusted EPS of $2.04 and revenue of $22.5 billion, which surpassed Wall Street estimates. Moreover, its revenue improved 5.3% from the year-ago quarter due to a rise in sales across both its reportable segments. Despite these positives, its shares plunged 1.9% on the day of the release. What disappointed investors the most was its underwhelming fiscal 2025 sales guidance. The company expects revenue in the range of $89.2 billion and $90 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimates. Additionally, while its adjusted earnings exceeded expectations, it declined 10.9% compared to the prior-year quarter, further weighing on investor sentiment.

Wall Street analysts are moderately optimistic about JNJ’s stock, with a ""Moderate Buy"" rating overall. Among 22 analysts covering the stock, eight recommend ""Strong Buy,"" two suggest “Moderate Buy,” and 12 advise “Hold.” The mean price target for JNJ is $169.18 which indicates a 5.9% potential upside from the current levels.

In September last year, Starbucks Chief Brian Niccol launched his ""Back to Starbucks"" campaign, which was slated to go into full swing in 2025, to counter declining sales and foot traffic at the renowned chain.

Ultimately, the Seattle-rooted coffee giant has expressed an eagerness to reclaim its reputation as the quintessential ""third place,"" a sanctuary aside from home and the office. Niccol proudly shared, ""I'm happy to say the third place is alive and well. It's as needed as it ever was.""

Perhaps the most notable change has been the menu updates. Last month, Starbucks told USA TODAY that it has revamped and scaled down its menu offerings to ""help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company.""

The company said it's trimming its menu by a whopping 30 percent. The initial phase of these reductions commenced in February. Starbucks clarified that the cuts would affect items that ""aren't commonly purchased, can be complex to make, or are similar to other beverages on the menu."" Choices like the Iced Matcha Lemonade, Java Chip Frappuccino, White Hot Chocolate and Honey Almondmilk Flat White were already cut.

Starbucks also said they are shaking things up with new store designs being trialed in various U.S. spots. ""We're working hard to ensure our coffee houses have the right vibe,"" Niccol said.

The coffee giant has reintroduced condiment bars, started serving drinks in ceramic mugs, and encouraged baristas to personalize cups with Sharpies. It's also broadened its free refill policy, now allowing more patrons to enjoy a second cup on the house than ever before.

Previously, only Starbucks Rewards members could snag a free refill, but that's changed. Now, any customer who orders a hot or iced coffee or tea for dine-in can request a refill during their visit at no extra cost at participating stores.

Earlier in the year, Starbucks revisited its restroom policy, now asking customers to purchase something before using the facilities or lounge in the café.

""Imagine coffee houses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays,"" Niccols envisioned.

He further explained: ""Stores with more separation between the café and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive handoff, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater to the experience and enhances the connection between our baristas and our customers.""

Niccol stated that the company also aims to deliver ""a high-quality beverage in four minutes or less with a moment of connection.""

In December 2024, Starbucks hinted at working on changes to make in-app and mobile orders more efficient, improving ""transparency and simplicity."" A few months later, Niccol announced that mobile ordering would now be limited to up to 12 items per order to decrease wait times.",https://i2-prod.irishstar.com/incoming/article34980843.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2196750077.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 14:10:33.359744

Starbucks India plans aggressive expansion of its store count despite facing losses since its entry into the market with Tata Group 12 years ago. The company focuses on various store formats and intends to strengthen its presence amid growing competition. Revenue growth has slowed down to 12% in FY24, while losses have tripled.

Starbucks India said it will aggressively expand their store count, despite running in losses. The coffee chain entered India 12 years ago with a joint venture with the Tata Group.

Sushant Dash, CEO, Starbucks India says ""We are focussing on store count expansion. And when you are doing that, it requires investment. And that has an impact on the bottom line.""

As of September 2024, the company has a new global CEO, Brian Niccol who took on the role after Laxman Narasimhan, who held the position since March 2023 and was replaced amid declining sales and stock prices, last September.

The current strategy of the company for India remains the same as it was under Narasimhan’s regime, Dash said. The company intends to continue to focus on arabica coffee, localized menus, store formats and store counts.

The total store count for the brand in India stands at 487. Out of these, 8 stores are drive-throughs. Majority of the drive-through stores for the brand are in Punjab.

Live Events

Dash adds, “India in terms of growth is amongst the top four markets for Starbucks, and we plan on increasing our store presence focusing on various store formats, like we have been doing.”

The coffee retail competition in India has been brewing steadily with UK based Pret A Manger entering India in April 2023, in a franchise agreement with Reliance Brands Limited, with plans to open 100 stores in five years.

Domestic competitor Third Wave Coffee crossed 100 outlets in India as of last year.

Starbucks India’s revenue growth slowed down to 12% in FY24, with revenue from operations at Rs 1,218.1 crore, and its losses increased three times at Rs 80 crore.

ID35,Starbucks,2025-04-04 11:30:26+00:00,Yahoo Finance,New Starbucks CEO Brian Nicoll was already worried about high prices. Now tariffs have ...,Lila MacLellan,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-ceo-brian-nicoll-already-090000012.html,"But the top reason customers say they’re going to Starbucks less often is its high prices, according to recent research from Deutsche Bank analysts.
Starbucks imports coffee from more than 30 countries, including Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariffs at 46%.
As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.
How Starbucks could weather the storm Indeed, the fear of a recession is one reason that Starbucks share prices sank yesterday, says Danilo Gargiulo, an equity research analyst for Bernstein.
In the 2008 crisis, he explains, Starbucks was one of the brands hardest hit by reduced consumer spending.","Since Brian Niccol took over as the CEO of Starbucks last fall, he has made a slew of moves to start bringing customers back to the company's stores and reverse slumping sales. He has vowed to reduce wait times for service, and he simplified the shop's menu, while encouraging in-store customers to linger over ceramic mugs.

But the top reason customers say they’re going to Starbucks less often is its high prices, according to recent research from Deutsche Bank analysts. And controlling prices may have just gotten a lot more difficult for Niccol.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, placing high taxes on imports from dozens of countries and a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports to the U.S. The president hopes his drastic actions will nudge businesses to buy supplies from American producers and make products in the U.S.. For coffee retailers like Starbucks, however, the levies will be impossible to dodge given that less than 1% of coffee consumed in the country is made domestically.

Starbucks imports coffee from more than 30 countries, including Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariffs at 46%.

As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.

A price freeze promise

Starbucks did not respond to Fortune's request for comment. But the company's former CFO acknowledged in an earnings call earlier this year that higher prices for coffee could impact revenue and profitability for the retail giant and its “already pressured consumer.”

The coffee company has angered customers in recent years by steeply raising prices as inflation rose in the U.S. The chief executive has already assigned himself a challenging task: he plans to invest in stores and employees as part of his turnaround plan, but has also committed to a price freeze through fiscal year 2025. So what now?

“Starbucks is either going to have lower margins and keep the prices where they are, or they'll be forced to raise prices,” says Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College.

If trade wars lead to steeper prices for a wide range of products, or push the U.S. into a recession, some Starbucks customers who currently pick up pricey drinks once or twice a week “may decide that they do not need that as much as they need to pay their rent or pay for health insurance,” Cohan adds. He predicts Starbucks will see fewer store visits, meaning lower sales of coffee, food, and non-coffee based drinks.

The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy.
The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.
While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive.
The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth.","According to a report from Moody’s, a global credit ratings, research, and risk analysis firm, Europe’s four largest primary insurers—Allianz, AXA, Generali, and Zurich Insurance —have reported record earnings for FY 2024, collectively reaching €28.6 billion, a 15% increase from the previous year.

Moody’s attributes these strong results to solid performances across all key divisions, with property and casualty (P&C) insurance and life and health (L&H) segments driving much of the growth.

The continued success in these sectors highlights the insurers’ robust positions in the market and their ability to navigate challenging economic environments.

The insurers demonstrated significant premium gains across both P&C and L&H sectors, with P&C premiums rising by 9% and L&H premiums increasing by 14%.

Moody’s emphasised that these increases were driven by price hikes and greater exposure, particularly in retail insurance. The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy. While the insurers exceeded their earnings targets for 2024, Moody’s expects slower profit growth in 2025, influenced by rising geopolitical risks and market uncertainties.

The P&C business was particularly strong in 2024, buoyed by both retail and commercial lines. Premium revenue, particularly in retail insurance, significantly boosted underwriting results, as insurers continued adjusting prices to respond to inflation in claims costs.

Allianz and Zurich were among those reporting improvements in their commercial combined ratios. Despite this, commercial pricing momentum showed some signs of slowing down, especially in certain markets. However, retail P&C lines saw significant improvement across most European regions.

Moody’s noted that the L&H business rebounded in 2024, showing growth after a slower 2023. This was driven by higher releases from the contractual service margin (CSM) and improved technical margins.

The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.

While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive. New business in the L&H sector grew by an average of 17% across the four companies, with Allianz and Generali seeing particularly strong results—up 20% and 30%, respectively. This growth was fuelled by a diverse mix of protection and savings products tailored to market demands.

According to Moody’s, the insurers reported stable solvency ratios, supported by strong capital generation. However, substantial shareholder returns, including dividends and share buybacks, partly offset these gains.

Despite a solid capital foundation, the insurers remain committed to progressive dividend policies, which may limit financial flexibility in times of economic stress. Moody’s also highlighted that their cautious outlook for capital management in 2025 could be influenced by rising geopolitical tensions and volatile financial markets.

Moody’s also pointed out the value of geographical diversification in strengthening these insurers’ positions. Allianz, AXA, and Generali have established dominant positions in their home markets (Germany, France, and Italy, respectively), while maintaining significant footprints across Europe and other regions.

Zurich, with its focus on P&C and commercial lines, has a strong presence in North America. This geographical spread has helped mitigate risks from natural catastrophes and has been instrumental in diversifying earnings.

While investment returns in 2024 were robust, buoyed by healthy interest rates and stable financial markets, the outlook for investment results in 2025 is more uncertain.

Moody’s indicated that rising geopolitical risks and potential market volatility could impact investment performance. The mixed outlook for investments is an area of concern as insurers must navigate broader market uncertainty, including potential economic slowdowns.

Looking ahead to 2025, Moody’s expects slower profit growth, though P&C performance is expected to continue benefiting from price increases and exposure growth.

However, the momentum in commercial pricing is likely to slow. The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth. In contrast, Allianz and Generali, with their focus on long-term life savings, appear better positioned for growth in this area.

Despite these challenges, Moody’s believes that the insurers remain well-positioned for further market share expansion. Their diverse portfolios, strong capital management, and geographical spread provide a solid foundation for the future.",https://www.reinsurancene.ws/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/moodys-logo-new.png,N,,2025-04-04 12:22:13.287636

Despite the highly challenging global economic and business environment, UBA recorded a profit before tax of US$539.388 million representing a 6.1 percent increase from US$508.490 million recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year.
Consequently, UBA Group Shareholders’ Funds rose from US$1,310.523 billion as at December 2023 to close the 2024 financial year at US$2,207.230 billion, achieving an impressive growth of 68.39 percent.

The 2024 financials, filed with the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGx) on Monday, showed an impressive rise in the bank’s profit after tax which went up by 26.14 percent to close the year at US$514.476 million, up from US$ 407.836 million recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.

The Bank’s gross earnings also grew significantly from US$13,959 billion recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year to US$21,409 billion in the period under consideration, representing a 53.6 percent growth.

Like in the previous years, the banks’ total assets also rose remarkably by 46.8 percent, from US$133,312 trillion in 2023, to close at US$196, 256 trillion in December 2024; signifying a milestone leap for the bank with the largest spread across the continent.

Despite the highly challenging global economic and business environment, UBA recorded a profit before tax of US$539.388 million representing a 6.1 percent increase from US$508.490 million recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year.

Consequently, UBA Group Shareholders’ Funds rose from US$1,310.523 billion as at December 2023 to close the 2024 financial year at US$2,207.230 billion, achieving an impressive growth of 68.39 percent.

As a result of the impressive performance and in fulfilment of the promise made by the UBA Group Chairman, Tony Elumelu, to shareholders at the last Annual General Meeting, the Bank proposed a final dividend of US$0.0019 for every ordinary share of US$ 0.0032, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024. This brings the total dividend in the year to US$0.0032 The final dividend is subject to the ratification of the shareholders during its upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM).

UBA’s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Alawuba, who expressed excitement at the results, stated that the 2024 financial performance demonstrates the bank’s continued focus on driving earnings growth, preserving asset quality, expanding business operations and deepening market share.

“Our continued investment in our highly diversified global network allows UBA to deliver high-quality, consistent earnings. Our businesses have been able to grow product and service income and expand our deposit base, allowing the Group to increase earnings while maintaining strong spreads and margins,” Alawuba highlighted.

According to him, “With total deposit increasing by 42.03 percent from US$11,233.054 billion in 2023 to US$15.946 billion and total assets hitting US$19.626 billion from US$19.819 billion, the just-released results reflect broad-based growth across all core businesses and were achieved despite prevailing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainties, and exchange rate volatilities.”

The GMD expressed excitement at the marked improvement recorded in the bank’s core earnings profile, as he explained that the profit is derived from high-quality income streams from funding intermediation, fees, and commissions, thus reflecting strong long-term, sustainable revenue generation capacity.

“Our ex-Nigeria (Rest of Africa & International) operations have expanded significantly over the past five years, now contributing 51.7% of Group revenue, up from 31% in 2019, delivering diversification benefits and further boosting long-term shareholder value. This will continue to grow, as we further explore strategic markets that align with our overall vision. We are currently upgrading our business scope and authorization in France, and considering other viable markets in the short to medium term,” Alawuba noted.

He pointed out the bank’s resolve to invest continuously in technology, data analytics, product innovation, staff training and development, which, according to him, will collectively enhance our customers’ experience.

On his part, UBA’s Executive Director, Finance & Risk Management, Ugo Nwaghodoh, said the bank recorded triple-digit growth in net interest income, resulting in remarkable improvement in net interest margin from 6.83 percent in 2023 to 9.02 percent, while also recording strong double-digit growth in fee and commission income lines of 91.66 percent.

“UBA Group continues to demonstrate strong capital levels, with shareholders’ funds’ growth of 68.4% to US$2.208 billion and a solid capital adequacy ratio of 31.0%., and as we defensibly position the portfolio to navigate prevailing global and regional macroeconomic upheavals, asset quality improved, with NPL ratio moderating to 5.58%, with strong provision coverage at 81%”, Nwaghodoh noted.

He explained that as the bank navigates evolving risks, its management remains focused on responsible growth, delivering customer-focused value propositions, whilst ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions.

Together, we will continue to brew success, deliver long-term value for our shareholders, and create a future with more cheers,” said Finance Director of International Breweries David Tomlinson.
This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt.
The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.","International Breweries has seen its loss after tax extended to the seventh year, as it recorded an N113bn loss in the 2024 financial year.

According to its audited financial report filed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited on Thursday, the brewer saw its loss worsen to N113.61bn from N70.03bn in 2023, marking a 62.25 per cent rise.

International Breweries had been on a losing streak since the 2018 financial year when it recorded a loss of N3.87bn, which grew to N27.79bn in 2019 and dipped to N16.08bn in 2020. The company’s loss slightly rose to N17.66bn in 2021 and higher to N21.63bn in 2022.

However, in the 2024 financial year, the company’s revenue reached a nine-year high of N488.96bn. Compared to the previous year’s revenue of N260.59bn, this was an 87.63 per cent jump year-on-year, indicating strong revenue growth.

Highlighting some of its challenges, the brewer in its annual report said, “While continually delivering strong revenue growth, our inability to source adequate foreign exchange due to market illiquidity impacted profitability, as we incurred significant FX losses on our foreign currency-denominated debt and liabilities.

“To address this, the company successfully raised fresh capital through a rights issue and settled the outstanding loan liability. Going into 2025, the company expects to return to profitability in the absence of any significant non-operating foreign currency exposure.

The company generated positive operating cash flows in the current year, 2024: N148.90bn (2023: N78.60bn) to cover its short-term obligations. The company is strategically positioned for success in the future and continues to have the backing of its ultimate parent company.”

International Breweries opened its N588bn rights issue programme in May 2024. The brewer sought to issue 161,172,395,100 new ordinary shares of two kobo each at an offer price of N3.65 per share. According to the rights issue circular, the terms include six new ordinary shares for every share held by existing shareholders.

It later expanded the offering to allow non-shareholders of the company to participate in its rights issue.

The brewer, which is a part of AB InBev, the largest brewer in the world, said at the time that the net proceeds from the rights issue would be used to settle its outstanding US dollar-denominated loan and provide working capital support.

“We are committed to creating sustainable value for our shareholders while fortifying our position in the Nigerian beverage industry. Together, we will continue to brew success, deliver long-term value for our shareholders, and create a future with more cheers,” said Finance Director of International Breweries David Tomlinson.

Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller, then the world’s second-largest brewer, in 2016.

This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt. The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.

As of December 2024, AB InBev Nigeria Holdings BV holds 161,580,471,272, equating to 96.1 per cent of the shares of the brewer.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/12015234/International-Breweries-Plc.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 23:00:33.982297

Nike Inc. (NKE-14.02%) has submitted its 10-Q filing for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2025.

The filing includes financial statements for the quarter, showing a decrease in revenues to $11.3 billion from $12.4 billion in the same quarter the previous year. The decrease is attributed to lower revenues in key regions and product segments.

Gross margin for the quarter decreased by 330 basis points to 41.5%, primarily due to lower average selling prices and higher inventory obsolescence reserves.

Net income for the quarter was $794 million, down from $1,172 million in the previous year. Earnings per share were $0.54, compared to $0.77 in the previous year.

“Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection.
“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email.
“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email.
“But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game.","Forever 21’s downfall cannot be attributed to a single factor. Yet, the once iconic fast fashion retailer pointedly singled out the rise of the likes of Shein and Temu as a key driver behind its second bankruptcy.

If you ask experts, however, the company’s demise isn’t a story of a sole misstep, but rather a series of interconnected failures, which, while including rising competition, also stemmed from an inability to adapt to the quick changing economic environment, trend cycles, and consumer shopping patterns.

The retailer, which will be closing all 350 of its stores in the US, had faced eerily similar woes during its first bankruptcy in 2019: overexpansion without a well thought-out strategy, an inability to keep up with digital trends, declining product appeal, and overall concerns around sustainability.

But instead of addressing its core problems, modernizing operations, or significantly improving its e-commerce presence like its competitors Zara and H&M, it simply downsized and, well…hoped for the best.

“In the case of Forever 21, the reasons given by management were all known at the time of their first bankruptcy,” Greg Portell, senior partner and global markets lead at Kearney, told Retail Brew via email. “Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection. In the end, any company should expect competition and can benefit from working to anticipate those moves.”

Cue the sequel: Denise Green, director of graduate studies in Cornell University’s fiber science and apparel design program, pointed to the significant struggles the retailer had on the sustainability front—a mounting concern that has put all fast fashion brands under scrutiny.

While retailers like Zara and H&M have focused on increasing awareness around their sustainability efforts, however flawed, Forever 21 seemed to have paid very little heed to its low-cost, disposable model. It doesn’t help that mid-priced brands such as Reformation and Everlane also gained traction at the same time by offering more ethically produced alternatives.

“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email. “The company’s overexpansion and inefficient supply chain further exacerbated its financial woes.”

Ironically, Shein and Temu have faced even greater scrutiny over their ethics and sustainability practices, yet that hasn’t deterred their loyal customer base from the vast selection of ultra-cheap offerings on both platforms.

“Retailers like Shein and Temu pose a significant threat because of their more agile supply chains, which enable rapid response to consumer trends and their shifting preferences,” Green said. “Competing against them requires a multifaceted approach: investing in technology to equalize supply chain agility, prioritizing sustainability, and enhancing brand loyalty through storytelling and personalization.”

Sam Vise, CEO of Optimum Retailing, an AI-supported retail intelligence platform, offers an alternate point of view. While acknowledging that Shein and Temu pose a real threat to fast fashion brands, he said it’s not because of their “speed or low prices” but because of a unique understanding of their customer.

“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email. “But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game. The key is not to try and outprice Shein or Temu online; it’s to offer something they fundamentally can’t. When done right, brick-and-mortar stores create an emotionally resonant experience that can’t be replicated while scrolling on an app.”

Final word: Vise suggests the “real opportunity” to tackle the threat from the duo lies in combining the strengths of both digital and physical retail.

“The retailers that will thrive are the ones who view their physical footprint as a strategic advantage: a space where online meets offline, and where shoppers can see, feel, try, and immediately take home the products they’ve browsed digitally,” he said. “To stay competitive, traditional fast fashion brands need to reframe their stores not as distribution points, but as experience centers that are flexible, localized, and deeply in tune with the customer.”

If there’s one takeaway from Forever 21’s decline, it’s that survival in retail isn’t about sticking to what worked in the past, it’s about evolving.

For any retailer looking to learn from this second stumble, Portell believes it’s this: “If a retailer is going to seek bankruptcy protection or embark on a management-controlled restructuring, it is important to take the opportunity to fix the entirety of the problem.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/cc30ee2912ec91ef5947d1a5ff219b967cef5b2b-5000x3335.jpg?rect=0,355,5000,2625&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-04-03 18:06:26.663112

The marketplace’s share within that has nearly doubled in just one year. The platform serves as a catalyst for growth for Decathlon, both in Germany and beyond.

Globally, Decathlon achieved a revenue of 16.2 billion euros last year. Adjusted for inflation, this represents a 3.8 percent increase compared to the previous year.

Online revenue

Digital sales are becoming increasingly important for the French sporting goods retailer. Last year, 20 percent of its global revenue came from online sales, including ecommerce, in-store connected orders, and marketplaces – up from 17 percent in 2023. In Germany, however, the online share is significantly higher.

Decathlon sells billions of euros worth of products online

In its reports, Decathlon also emphasizes its focus on the importance of the planet and people. Despite sales growth, the company reduced its CO2 emissions last year. Additionally, it continues to employ more people, now with staff from 87 different nationalities. The proportion of women in the workforce has also increased.

Omnichannel strategy and marketplace

In a separate report on Germany, Decathlon attributes its positive revenue development to “the consistent implementation of its omnichannel strategy, which seamlessly integrates the digital and physical shopping experience”. The company also highlights “the remarkable development of the online marketplace”, which accounted for 20 percent of digital sales last year. For comparison: in 2023, this was 11 percent, and in 2022, just 7 percent.

German marketplace share has tripled since 2022

Given that Decathlon’s German marketplace has not been active for very long, its rapid growth is not surprising. However, platform sales are exceeding expectations. It has become a catalyst for further profitable online growth, much like what has been seen with online marketplaces of MediaMarkt, Zalando and Otto.

Dickson's counterpart at Levi Strauss & Co Michelle Gass echoed the reduced exposure to China at Shoptalk too, saying ""Of what we know today, right now it is fairly minimal.""

In recent years, many U.S. apparel makers have gradually reduced their reliance on China because of rising costs there, the abundance of capacity in Southeast Asia, and the threat of a trade conflict with the U.S. always looming.

But Dickson and Gass' sanguine reactions of course came before the Trump Administration's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to impose punitive tariffs on 60 countries, including across-the-board levies of 46% on imports from Vietnam and 26% from India. Suddenly, Gap Inc and Levi's don't seem inoculated at all from Trump's tariff war with the rest of the world.

Gap Inc shares were down 22% in early trading on Thursday, while Levi's were down 11%. Other apparel-heavy retailers saw big drops like Macy's, down 16%. (Home goods retailers, also very exposed to tariffs on Asian suppliers, similarly got dinged, with Restoration Hardware down 42%.)

When President Trump this winter announced his first salvos in the tariff wars, focused initially on China, Canada and Mexico, many retailers rushed to reassure investors that over time, they had lessened their exposure to China, long known as a maker of cheap items for Western brands. Target's Chief Commercial Officer said in March that Chinese goods now represent 30% of its merchandise, down from 60% in 2017. Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.

Ditto for Nike, which said in its most recent annual report that factories in Vietnam made half of the shoes it sells and more than a quarter of the apparel in Vietnam. The sportswear giant, trying to carry off a turnaround amid waning interest in its wares, saw its shares fall 15%.

What has investors worried is that it is very difficult to shift production elsewhere with any speed, and there are few new options left anyway.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EY3aVZby2RBKHUmIM_tekQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/47ff0c3a89dc065e50d3bae0ad09c6ed,N,,2025-04-03 16:04:13.517265

Walmart, Best Buy, and other major retailers are already feeling the impact of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which are set to take effect April 9. The initial 10% tariff will kick in this Saturday, April 5.

Other retailers, including Dollar General (DG+4.65%), Dollar Tree (DLTR-12.09%), Target (TGT-11.31%), and Best Buy (BBY-17.62%), are also taking a hit. Suffering the most damage thus far is Five Below (FIVE-26.62%), whose shares plummeted over 20%, and Best Buy, which saw a nearly 12% drop. Retailers are bracing for the fallout, with many executives warning that rising costs could push prices higher for consumers.

Retail giants like Walmart, Costco, and Target are reportedly racing to shift the tariff burden onto their Chinese suppliers, a move that could help them absorb some of the financial pressure. However, suppliers operating on razor-thin margins may pass those costs back to U.S. companies, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers on everyday items like fruits, vegetables, electronics, and apparel.

Walmart (WMT-2.91%), Best Buy, and Target have already indicated they may raise prices should tariffs take effect. The National Retail Federation (NRF) recently issued a warning, projecting a slowdown in consumer spending for 2025 if tariffs continue to escalate. Both Gregory Daco, EY’s chief economist, and Sarah Wolfe, Morgan Stanley’s (MS-9.63%) senior economist and strategist, expressed concerns that higher-than-expected tariff could increase everyday costs, putting a strain on household budgets and dampening consumer demand.

New tariffs from the Trump administration, slapping a 10% base rate on imports, are rattling the retail sector, hitting giants like Best Buy and home-furnishing firms hard.

What does this mean?

These tariffs, set to impact imports from China, Japan, and other countries, are creating a tough environment for retailers reliant on imported goods. Best Buy, which focuses on import-driven, big-ticket items, saw its shares dive 15% following the announcement, while Wayfair, RH, Williams-Sonoma, and Arhaus took even bigger hits. RH plans to work with manufacturers to soften the effect on margins after missing fiscal targets. Conversely, Williams-Sonoma stays optimistic, expecting limited macroeconomic effects. Experts suggest consumers might absorb some cost hikes, as vendors are likely to pass some tariff expenses onto retailers.

Why should I care?

The bigger picture: Retail reshuffling on the rise.

While hardline retailers struggle with tariff impacts, those less reliant on imports like Chewy and Petco Health and Wellness, along with auto parts retailers like AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive, appear more resilient. Their focus on essential items and pricing power could help them weather the changing trade landscape, highlighting a broader market shift towards resilience against import volatility.

For markets: The import-export debate.

The tariffs' introduction has injected uncertainty into market dynamics, affecting investor confidence and share values. Some retailers may try cost-cutting and pricing tactics, but the overall impact on consumer spending and economic sentiment is still up in the air. As markets adjust, analysts continue to evaluate how these tariffs will affect purchasing power and sector growth in the coming months.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-x4W9QLyc66CJ8JgoIJ06tf8D.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=6844e19748ee6c1e03880a9935af03b9,N,,2025-04-03 15:10:11.716457

The lifeline is not a Band-Aid nor yet a permanent solution, with Amsa stating: “The facility is repayable subject to agreement between the parties and contingent on the financial performance, solvency and liquidity of the Long Steel Business,” in a press release.

This development follows a R1.683-billion facility provided by the Industrial Development Corporation, aimed at sustaining the business while seeking long-term solutions to a proposed business dissolution that would have seen South Africa’s longest-running steel producer close down, with thousands of jobs on the line.

Long steel long in the tooth

The long steel business — Amsa’s division focused on the production of fencing material, rail, rods, and bars — serves as a vital supplier to the construction, mining, and manufacturing sectors, with core operations centred in Newcastle and Vereeniging.

While its products form the literal backbone of infrastructure development, the business has struggled to remain standing, in large part due to the broader infrastructure challenges within the country regarding entities such as the Passenger Rail Association of South Africa (Prasa) and Transnet.

By end 2024 operational losses at the Longs division had doubled to R1.1-billion, and for Amsa overall, headline losses topped R5.1-billion — reflecting an unsustainable combination of sluggish domestic demand, punishing electricity tariffs, inefficient rail logistics, and pressure from smaller, nimbler mini-mill competitors.

The wind-down

In November 2023 Amsa announced its intention to shutter long steel operations by April 2025, citing persistent losses and an absence of favourable policy concessions; the company had signalled that it could no longer absorb the unit’s cash burn.

But in a turn of events on Monday, 31 March 2025, Amsa confirmed that the Industrial Development Corporation had stepped in with a R1.683-billion funding facility, halting the shutdown — at least for now.

The Industrial Development Corporation facility is repayable based on the solvency, liquidity, and financial performance of the Long Steel Business, and buys Amsa six more months to stabilise operations and negotiate longer-term reforms.

Government and stakeholder involvement

The deferral forms part of a broader emergency rescue framework involving government ministries, regulators, and key stakeholders. Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau has committed to addressing long-standing structural challenges in the steel sector.

These include a reform of the scrap metal Preferential Pricing System, revisions to the scrap export tax, and the introduction of safeguard tariffs to shield domestic producers from low-cost imports.

To ease pressure on Amsa’s balance sheet, the company has also secured Temporary Employee Relief Scheme funding to offset payroll costs during the deferral window. In response, Amsa has suspended the Section 189(3) retrenchment consultations, offering a temporary reprieve to thousands of workers.

In a joint effort with the Industrial Development Corporation, government representatives have said the deferral period would be used to address “structural problems previously identified by the company”, with the goal of placing the Long Steel Business on a more sustainable footing.

Industrial Development Corporation in to save the day

The Industrial Development Corporation’s support may extend beyond this immediate bailout. The state-owned financier, which already holds a 6.4% stake in Amsa, has signalled its interest in increasing its shareholding. CEO Kobus Verster confirmed that a due diligence process was now under way in a media briefing earlier today: “The Industrial Development Corporation has indicated that they have a desire to look at an increased shareholding, and for that, a due diligence period has been agreed upon.”

Jobs on the line

The decision to keep Amsa’s long steel operations running preserves about 3,500 direct and indirect jobs that would have been lost in the event of a shutdown. But even with this intervention, the sustainability of those jobs hinges on deeper reforms.

South Africa’s steel value chain — critical to sectors such as construction, mining, and automotive manufacturing — relies heavily on long product availability. Any disruption risks ripple effects across the broader economy. The deferral provides breathing room to maintain that supply while systemic fixes are pursued, but should these not be resolved, it’s unclear how similar challenges will be avoided for the Industrial Development Corporation in the future.

The industry’s long-term mettle

Despite the temporary fix, fundamental issues — aging infrastructure, low cost competitiveness, and regulatory burden — require more than financial stopgaps. Without major industrial reform, the Long Steel Business could merely be delaying the inevitable.

Protective tariffs have been inconsistently applied, and regulatory interventions have often come too late to be effective. The scrap Preferential Pricing System, in particular, has been blamed for distorting market prices and advantaging recyclers over primary producers like Amsa.

During the deferral period, Amsa will explore strategic alternatives to turn the business around. These include operational efficiency programmes, modernising production processes, expanding the product range, and deepening supplier and customer collaboration.

More promisingly, Amsa is cautiously optimistic about green shoots in demand — particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors, where state and private projects could revive appetite for long steel products.",https://i0.wp.com/www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BM-Ray-ArcelorMittal-MAIN.jpg?fit=1280%2C678&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-03 12:18:16.835017

Conagra said it expects limited impact to fiscal 2025 from previously announced US tariffs on steel and aluminium and imports from China. It also kept its annual forecasts unchanged.

Shares of the packaged food company rose 3.6% in early trading.

Digital sales now represent 20 percent of total revenue, including e-commerce, marketplaces and in-store connected orders.

Decathlon said it “reinforced its commitment to empower people to lead healthier, more active lives in 2024.”

“A year after unveiling its new ambition and strategy as well as its global brand identity, Decathlon has undergone a transformative journey, evolving as a multi-specialist sports brand that inspires everyone — from beginners to Olympic and Paralympic athletes — to embrace the power of sport, the company said in a media release.

The company said this transformation is underway, with 200 stores either newly opened or modernized, alongside an optimized brand portfolio to offer greater clarity and better serve its customers.

Decathlon expects, by 2026, to restructure 90 percent of its product offerings.

Rigorous cost-control measures reportedly mitigated the impact of cost inflation, allowing Decathlon to maintain its commercial momentum while ensuring affordable prices. Optimizing operational expenses remains a key priority for 2025 to support long-term growth.

Net income was €787 million in 2024, compared to €931 million in 2023.

Decathlon operates in 79 territories and continues its international development. In India, the company is investing €100 million ($111 million) over the next five years to expand its store count and manufacturing capabilities. In Germany, Decathlon plans to invest up to €100 million by 2027 in opening new stores and modernizing existing locations.

Decathlon said its partnership with the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics was a highlight of the year. Decathlon designed and manufactured the outfits for the 45,000 volunteers. This collaboration resonated with the public, with 1.8 million licensed products sold in 2024. In addition, Decathlon recorded a 10 percent increase in store traffic (omni-channel) across France during the Olympic Games and a 6.7 percent rise during the Paralympic Games.

In other Decathlon news, the company reported embarking on a new phase in its history, appointing Javier López as chief executive officer, replacing CEO Barbara Martin Coppola, who has had the role since March 2022.

“I am particularly honored by the confidence of Julien and the Board of Directors as I take up my new position, and I thank Barbara, with whom I have enjoyed working in the Executive Committee for the past three years,” offered López. “As a Decathlonian for 26 years, I’m proud of the work we’ve done over the years to bring the benefits of sport to more and more people around the world. Together, with all our teammates, we will, with determination, enthusiasm and humility, accelerate our economic development and our efforts to serve our human and environmental commitments.

Julien Leclercq, who has assumed the role of chairman of Decathlon’s Board of Directors, commented, “I would like to thank Barbara for the impactful work she has carried out over the past 3 years. Today, Decathlon is a sports brand that is increasingly recognized around the world for its products, its commitments and its positive impact. As Decathlon embarks on a new phase in its history, I have every confidence in Javier and his natural ability to bring people together to drive our ambition and identify new levers for sustainable growth while further strengthening our unique human and inclusive culture.”

Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.
Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger.
He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.
Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value.
“Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint.","Kroger Co. spent more than a billion dollars on the planned $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.

Downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR), the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, detailed those expenses in its newly released Form 10-K filed April 1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Kroger officials said the company spent $1.044 billion in merger-related expenses dating back to 2022. The majority of those, $684 million, were incurred in fiscal 2024, which ended Feb. 1, 2025. Those costs followed $316 million in fiscal 2023 and $44 million in 2022.

Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger. The deal would have combined the nation’s second-largest operator of traditional supermarkets in Albertsons with Kroger. It would have been the largest merger involving U.S. supermarkets in history and combined Kroger’s 2,722 stores with Albertsons’ 2,271 stores to create a national behemoth.

But regulators and state attorneys general opposed the acquisition and merger on antitrust grounds. They believed the combination would be anticompetitive in many markets. The Federal Trade Commission sued in February 2024 to block it and multiple state attorneys general sued to halt the acquisition. All cited antitrust factors.

A federal court judge sided with the FTC in ruling Dec. 10, 2024, to halt the deal and a Washington state court judge issued a similar ruling the same day. Albertsons and Kroger separately called off the transaction the next day.

Albertsons also sued Kroger Dec. 11 for breach of the merger agreement.

Through it all, Kroger spent that $1 billion-plus largely on third-party professional fees and credit facility fees, Kroger officials said in the filing. Those likely consist largely of attorney fees and costs related to Kroger’s issuance of $10.5 billion in debt in August to pay for the acquisition. Kroger later used much of that money to buy back $7.5 billion in stock.

Kroger officials didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Analysts largely said merger-related charges like that, even when they’re for a deal that ultimately didn’t happen, are the price companies pay for doing business.

“These expenses are generally viewed as the cost of doing business and investors tend to look through these one-time costs,” Johnson Investment Counsel Senior Research Analyst Joe Abbott told me.

He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.

“In other words, the acquisition-related expenses would have been more than paid for by the long-term value created by the combined entity,” Abbott said.

Kevin Gade, chief operating officer and portfolio manager at downtown-based Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, said Kroger has been able to overcome those costs that ultimately didn’t pay off.

“I would categorize it as a stranded cost that is likely to get no return on that time or money spent unless Kroger pursues Albertsons again imminently,” Gade said. “Kroger has been an excellent investment since the deal was officially called off in December. So while absorbing stranded costs is painful, the market was skeptical on this deal.”

Indeed, Kroger shares have gained 16% since the market closed Dec. 9, the day before the court rulings against the deal were issued. Kroger stock gained 4 cents Wednesday to close April 2 at $67.27.

But James Lewis, portfolio manager and senior equity research analyst at Bartlett Wealth Management, said the costs are higher than those incurred in most deals. Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value. Kroger’s costs are at the high end of that range, he said.

“One factor to consider is the complexity of the deal,” Lewis said. “Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint. Regulatory hurdles were high. Deals involving companies in unrelated industries typically have lower acquisition costs since the transaction does not undergo strict regulatory oversight.”

Kroger is certain to incur even more costs. Albertsons is suing it to collect a $600 million termination fee. C&S Wholesale Grocers, which agreed to buy 579 stores that Kroger planned to divest in order to appease regulators, also is suing Kroger to collect a $125 million termination fee.

Whether Kroger ends up paying those fees, settling for lower amounts or wins, it’ll incur further attorney and legal fees in the process.

The Albertsons acquisition's termination also was closely followed by fallout in Kroger’s C-suite. CEO and Chairman Rodney McMullen resigned March 2 following a Kroger board investigation of his personal conduct that, while ""unrelated to the business, was inconsistent with Kroger’s Policy on Business Ethics,” the company said in a news release. No other details have been released. Lead director Ron Sargent was named interim CEO and chairman.

Elsewhere in the 10-K filing, Kroger lists 14 risk factors that could affect its business. All companies list risks to the business. While the list is quite comprehensive and largely reflects similar risks to a year ago, one factor on last year’s list is missing this year: “Our proposed transaction with Albertsons creates incremental business, regulatory and reputational risks.”

Another change among risk factors this year is the presence of tariffs as a concern. Kroger lists tariffs as risks under the fuel, economic conditions and supply chains categories. As it relates to Kroger’s fuel sales, the company noted it can’t predict the cost and availability of fuel and how customers will react, possibly due to tariffs among other factors.

Tariffs also are viewed as creating uncertainty regarding future economic conditions. And tariffs could hurt Kroger’s business by interrupting its product supply, the company said. The word “tariff” didn’t appear among risk factors a year ago.",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12935048/kroger-building-4*1200xx3600-2025-0-188.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 14:07:06.539758

“There is less consumer demand for the locally manufactured products and high-potential Danone products cannot be produced locally,” Trechman added.
The Ochsenfurt plant manufactures dairy products, desserts and high-protein puddings.
The company said it will review vacancies at the Fulda plant to offer retraining opportunities for affected employees in Ochsenfurt.
""Danone to close Germany dairy plant"" was originally created and published by Just Food, a GlobalData owned brand.","Danone plans to shut a dairy plant in Germany, pointing to production costs and the facility not using its full capacity.

The Activia maker said it is lining up the closure of the site in Ochsenfurt by the final quarter of next year.

In a statement, Danone explained the decision was necessary as the “only way to remain competitive and successful in the long term in German-speaking countries”. Around 230 jobs will be affected.

The French giant said production costs at the site are ""well above the average of other European Danone plants"". It also cited ""years of inefficiency caused by declining capacity utilisation"".

Danone said the facility’s capacity utilisation is expected to reach only half of 2019 levels in 2024, making the closure “unavoidable”.

Richard Trechman, managing director for Danone's operations in Germany, said the plant is “not sustainable in the current market situation”.

“There is less consumer demand for the locally manufactured products and high-potential Danone products cannot be produced locally,” Trechman added.

The Ochsenfurt plant manufactures dairy products, desserts and high-protein puddings. Asked from where Danone would ship these products to Germany after the closure of the site, a spokesperson said: ""Where the products will be concretely produced after the planned closure will be decided in the coming months.""

Danone said “remains committed” to Germany as a manufacturing base and plans “significant investments” at its Fulda site, the company said in its statement.

The Fulda facility, with nearly 600 employees, is focused on producing specialised products such as baby formula and medical nutrition.

The spokesperson said: ""Our Fulda facility is one of Danone's largest production sites globally, supplying products to over 70 countries, including Germany. The plant plays an important role in the company's overall strategy, and we are investing every year a double-digit million euro amount in modern, high-tech production capacities.""

The company said it will review vacancies at the Fulda plant to offer retraining opportunities for affected employees in Ochsenfurt.
